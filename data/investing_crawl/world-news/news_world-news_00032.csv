A U.S. court in May jailed a Halkbank executive for helping Tehran get round U.S. sanctions. Halkbank faces potential U.S. fines in relation to that case.
Albayrak's comments came after President Tayyip Erdogan announced over the weekend that he had discussed the bank with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Erdogan gave few details of those talks but his comments came amid indications that Washington and Ankara are trying to mend ties that have been in crisis this year over a host of issues, including the conviction of a Halkbank executive for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
""We had a positive meeting with our U.S.counterpart (Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin). He said he would follow the process closely,"" Erdogan's son-in-law Albayrak told broadcaster A Haber.
""We told them that Halkbank had not violated sanctions (...) We have positive expectations,"" he said.

Shares in Turkey's state-owned Halkbank surged 5.88 to 7.37 lira.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer faced calls on Monday to dismiss the outgoing head of domestic intelligence from a new advisory role, after the spy condemned what he called ""naive and leftist"" government policies and said he might enter politics.
The remarks, made at a closed meeting of European intelligence chiefs and published by the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday, threatened to re-open a rift which Chancellor Angela Merkel's fractious coalition had only just patched up.
Seehofer once before rescued chief spy Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal when he questioned the authenticity of videos showing far-right extremists chasing immigrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
This time Maassen, whose agency monitors extremist threats to Germany's constitutional order, compared the videos to Russian propaganda and presented himself as the victim of a witch-hunt by ""radical-left forces"" in the Social Democratic Party (SPD), junior partner in Merkel's coalition.
""I'm seen in Germany as a critic of idealistic, naive and leftist foreign and security policy,"" he said. ""I can imagine a life outside public service, for example in politics or business.""
Many on the right in Germany are particularly scornful of what they see as Merkel's liberal immigration policy, which has been backed by the SPD. Germany has admitted about a million mostly Muslim asylum seekers since the 2015 migration crisis. 
Even before Maassen's remarks were published in full, the SPD and opposition parties had been demanding Maassen's sacking for overstepping the bounds of neutrality that German civil servants are expected to adhere to.
""SWIFT DECISION"" URGED
The interior ministry said Seehofer, who himself is facing calls to quit as head of his Christian Social Union (CSU) after it lost its majority in last month's Bavarian regional election, would make a decision over Maassen's fate after an investigation into the speech was completed.
SPD general secretary Lars Klingbeil said Seehofer should take a ""swift decision"" over Maassen's fate.
The recriminations follow bruising setbacks for all three parties in Merkel's coalition in crucial regional votes over the past month. The poor results prompted Merkel to resign as head of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and many are calling for the loveless coalition to end.
Maassen only escaped dismissal after his first political intervention, made in an interview with top-selling tabloid Bild in September, thanks to the patronage of Seehofer, who created a senior role for him in his ministry.
But Seehofer's patronage may mean less than it did, with the CSU fuming after he led it to its weakest result in years.

On Sunday the CSU, which has for decades dominated cultural and economic life in Germany's richest region, was forced to concede Bavaria's economy, education and environment ministries to the Free Voters, its new upstart coalition partner.

Earlier ITV's political editor reported that the British government had decided that unless a deal was struck within a week, the default option of a no-deal Brexit becomes the probable outcome.
Asked about reports that this week was a decisive one in the Brexit negotiations, May's spokesman said: ""We are working to secure a deal as soon as possible, in relation to that particular summit, the European Council set out its position at the EU Council in October. It's obviously a decision for them.""
On the main sticking point in the negotiations, a backstop to maintain an open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, the spokesman said: ""We don't want the backstop to be in place indefinitely and (we have said) that we would be looking to a mechanism to achieve that.""

""The Black Sea Navy Fleet's frigate Admiral Makarov left (Navy base) Sevastopol and laid a course for the Black Sea straits. The vessel will be acting in the standing naval force of the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean,"" the Russian Defence Ministry said in statement.
Russia has in the past fired Kalibr cruise missiles from frigates and submarines stationed in the Mediterranean Sea at militant targets to support Syrian army offensives.
The ministry did not say whether the frigate was supposed to take part in the military operation in Syria where Moscow has backed President Bashar al-Assad since entering the war in 2015.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May that Russian military vessels with Kalibr cruise missiles would be on permanent standby in the Mediterranean to counter what he said was the terrorist threat in Syria.
Russia deployed several warships to the Mediterranean this summer, including the Admiral Grigorovich, Admiral Essen and Pytlivy frigates, along with landing ship Nikolai Filchenkov and the Vishny Volochek missile corvette. 
The Izvestia newspaper said in August that Russia had gathered its largest naval group in the Mediterranean Sea since 2015, including 10 vessels, most of them armed with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles. More vessels were on the way, the newspaper said, and two submarines had also been deployed.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Relatives of the victims of an Indonesian jet that crashed into the sea off Jakarta last week killing all 189 on board demanded answers on Monday as to why the plane had been passed fit to fly and called for no let up in the search for loved ones. 
Indonesian authorities on Sunday extended by three days the search for victims and a second black box recorder from wreckage of a nearly new  Boeing Co . (N:BA) 737 MAX that slammed into the sea a week ago only minutes after it took off from Jakarta. 
At a news conference charged with emotion, relatives addressed questions to Indonesian officials including transport minister Budi Karya Sumadi and the head of the country's transportation safety committee (KNKT). 
""We are the victims here. Imagine if you were in our position,"" said Najib Fuquoni, a relative of a victim, demanding an independent investigation into the crash.
Muhammad Bambang Sukandar, the father of another victim, said Lion Air technicians needed to take ""full responsibility"" if it was proved they had not properly attended to technical issues following the jet's previous flight from Bali to Jakarta.
""This is not an unimportant thing. These are people’s lives,"" he said, as he sought to choke back tears.
""Don't let something like this keep happening in Indonesia,"" he added.
Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, but its safety record has been patchy. Its transport safety panel investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.
At one stage during Monday's news conference, relatives urged Lion Air founder Rusdi Kirana, who was in the audience, to stand up. He stood up, but did not comment and clasped his hands together as if seeking forgiveness. 
The privately owned budget carrier was founded in 1999. Its aircraft have been involved in at least 15 safety incidents and it has been placed under tougher international safety restrictions than other Indonesian airlines.
While victims' relatives are desperate to know what happened, the first crash of a Boeing 737 MAX is also the focus of scrutiny by the global aviation industry. 
""As an initial step we conducted ramp checks for 11 Boeing 737 Max 8,"" said transport minister Sumadi, adding that authorities were also conducting a special audit to include operating procedures and crew qualifications.
The search effort has involved 151 divers, five helicopters, 61 ships, ranging from fishing boats to ships with advanced sonar scanners, as well as underwater drones.
An Indonesian rescue diver died during the search for a second black box, parts of the plane, and human remains on the muddy seabed.
The head of KNKT Surjanto Tjahjono has said 69 hours of recorded data from 19 flights, including the one that crashed, had been downloaded successfully from a partly damaged flight data recorder recovered on Thursday.
As of Monday, 138 body bags containing human remains had been recovered and handed to police for forensic identification, yet only 14 victims had been identified.
Among the larger parts of the plane found have been a mangled engine and a damaged aircraft wheel.
Tjahjono said based on initial analysis the ""engine was running with fairly high speed"" when it hit the water.
While there were no signs of an explosion in the air, the plane appeared to have hit the water with huge force, he said. 
""When the plane hit the water, the energy released was extraordinarily large.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air quality in India's haze-hit north, including the capital, New Delhi, deteriorated sharply on Monday because of unfavorable weather and an increase in smoke from stubble burning in fields across the region.
Levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that can reach deep into the lungs and cause major health problems, were above 400 in most parts of the capital, and in some places soared above 600.
That is nearly 24 times a recommended level of 25 micrograms per cubic meter on average over a 24-hour period, set by the World Health Organization, which this year said India was home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities. 
New Delhi was ranked the sixth most polluted.
After a little improvement on Sunday, when wind picked up, air quality worsened early on Monday, with forecasts of worse to come over the next few days.
""Wind speeds dropped to 15 kilometers per hour from 29 and there's a significant jump in crop stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana in the past few hours,"" Anumita Roychowdhury, an executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment think-tank, said, referring to two states where farmers burn stubble in their fields to prepare for winter planting.
Authorities warn that crop residue burning will peak in the next few days.
Adding to the fears, Indians will celebrate the festival of Diwali on Wednesday, when many members of the majority Hindu community will set off celebratory firecrackers.
The Supreme Court last month allowed the use of ""green"" firecrackers for Diwali to try to curb pollution, but it was unclear how the rule would be enforced or whether there was such a thing as an environmentally safe firework.
Lower winter temperatures and higher moisture, coupled with lower wind speeds tend to trap pollutants in the atmosphere, said Roychowdhury.
The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology also said that changes in the speed and direction of the wind, and more stubble burning, had made the air more toxic.
The sale of air purifiers had surged 40 percent from last year because of increasing public awareness about the effects of pollution on health, company and industry officials said.
New Delhi and its satellite cities account for the bulk of air purifier sales but they are picking up in other cities such as Mumbai and Bengaluru.

The air purifier market is dominated by Unilever's, Blueair, Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) and Britain's Dyson.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia sent a two-man ""clean-up team"" to erase evidence of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing a week after he disappeared at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a Turkish official said on Monday, calling it a sign top Saudi officials knew of the crime.
Confirming a report in Turkey's pro-government Sabah newspaper, the official said the chemist and toxicologist were tasked with erasing evidence before Turkish investigators were given access to the Saudi consulate and consul's residence.
Sabah identified the two men as Ahmed Abdulaziz al-Jonabi and Khaled Yahya al-Zahrani, saying they arrived in Turkey as part of an 11-person team sent to carry out the inspections with Turkish officials.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared at the consulate on Oct. 2.
Saudi officials initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, then said he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". The kingdom's public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said he was killed in a premeditated attack.
Turkish and Saudi officials have carried out joint inspections of the consulate and consul's residence in Istanbul, but President Tayyip Erdogan says some Saudi officials are still trying to cover up the crime. Ankara has also demanded Riyadh cooperate in finding Khashoggi's body, which Istanbul's chief prosecutor said had been dismembered.
A senior Turkish official confirmed the names of the men identified on Monday by Sabah. ""We believe that the two individuals came to Turkey for the sole purpose of covering up evidence of Jamal Khashoggi's murder before the Turkish police were allowed to search the premises,"" the official said.
The two individuals carried out clean-up operations at the consulate and the consul's residence in Istanbul until October 17 and left the country three days later, he said.
""The fact that a clean-up team was dispatched from Saudi Arabia nine days after the murder suggests that Khashoggi's slaying was within the knowledge of top Saudi officials,"" the official said.
Saudi Arabia says 18 people have been detained over Khashoggi's killing and the head of its human rights commission told a meeting in Geneva on Monday Riyadh was investigating the case with a view to prosecuting the perpetrators. 
ACID REPORTS
Saudi Arabia's conflicting accounts of Khashoggi's killing have prompted international outcry against the world's top oil exporter, upending the young crown prince's international image as a reformer.
Turkey has released a stream of evidence challenging the initial Saudi denials of involvement, and continues to press Riyadh for details.
On Monday Vice President Fuat Oktay called for an investigation into newspaper reports last week that Khashoggi's body was disposed of by dissolving it in acid.
""The question now is who gave the orders. This is what we are seeking answers to now,"" Fuat Oktay told Anadolu news agency. ""Another question is where the body is... There are reports of (the body) being dissolved with acid now. All of these need to be looked at"".

In an article in the Washington Post on Friday, Erdogan said the order to kill Khashoggi came from the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government and called for the ""puppetmasters"" to be unmasked.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",France issues arrest warrants for senior Syrian officials,"PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors have issued international arrest warrants for three senior Syrian intelligence and government officials, including security chief Ali Mamlouk, for alleged collusion in war crimes, a defense lawyer and a judicial source said on Monday. 
Mamlouk, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most senior advisers, was targeted by the order alongside Jamil Hassan, the head of Airforce Intelligence who is already the subject of a German warrant, the sources said.
Another senior Airforce Intelligence official, Abdel Salam Mahmoud, was also named in the French order, one of the sources said. 
The warrants stem from a long-running case involving two French-Syrian nationals who were arrested in Syria in November 2013 and had disappeared since. 
Damascus confirmed in August 2018 that the father and son, Mazen and Patrick Abdelkader Dabbagh, were dead, the sources said. They include a lawyer for their family, Clemence Bectarte, who said the warrants were issued in mid-October. 
Prosecutors in Paris had already opened a probe into the pair's disappearance, starting with a preliminary investigation in 2015, and had found that their house in Damascus had been raided by intelligence officials, the judicial source said. 
The French warrants bring charges including collusion in torture, forced disappearances, crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Syrian officials.
Germany - which has universal jurisdiction over war crimes, meaning it can prosecute and try crimes committees abroad - has also taken similar steps, issuing an arrest warrant in June for Airforce Intelligence official Hassan.
Efforts to prosecute members of the Assad government have repeatedly failed because Syria is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague. Russia and China have also vetoed attempts to give the ICC a mandate to set up a special tribunal for Syria.

The case, seen by many Danes as a symbol of the decline in confidence in once trusted institutions, comes in the wake of a major government tax scandal and a money laundering case involving the country's largest bank, Danske Bank. 
Denmark is now working with the South African authorities to extradite the woman, 64, the State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime said in a statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach the suspect's lawyer for comment, but he was quoted by Danish broadcaster DR as saying he did not wish to disclose how his client would respond to the accusations.
According to anti-corruption coalition Transparency International, Denmark is one of the least corrupt countries in the world.
The woman, an employee of the Danish ministry for social affairs for more than 40 years, is suspected of transferring government funds intended for vulnerable people to her own accounts between 2002 and 2018. 
""The arrest of the main suspect means there is now hope of finding the lost millions,"" Danish justice minister Soren Pape Poulsen wrote on Twitter.
The woman had been the subject of an international arrest warrant since Oct. 18 when the ministry announced the findings of an internal investigation.
Three other people are suspected of involvement in the case. One of them was arrested in Johannesburg on Oct. 30.

With just five months until Britain is due to exit the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a divorce deal, with negotiators stuck on the terms of the so-called ""backstop"" insurance arrangement to keep open the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland.
Cautious optimism that a deal between the EU and London may be in the offing in coming weeks has been kept in check by the fact that it remains far from clear whether any such agreement could go through the British parliament. 
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that May's Brexit Minister Dominic Raab had privately demanded the right to pull Britain out of the ""backstop"" arrangement for the Irish border after three months.
""The Irish position remains consistent and v (ery) clear that a 'time-limited backstop' or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by Ireland or the European Union,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter.
""These ideas are not backstops at all + don't deliver on previous UK commitments,"" he added, following the media report that Raab made the pitch to Coveney in a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The message quickly won endorsement from the EU's deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, who reacted to Coveney's comments by saying: ""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems.""
After a meeting in Dublin on Friday with Britain's Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, May's de facto deputy, both Coveney and Lidington said the two sides were ""very close"" to resolving differences on the border issue.
The sides have moved closer to agreeing on customs arrangements under the emergency Irish border fix, sources in Brussels have said, which would keep all of the United Kingdom in a customs arrangement with the EU, as London has sought. It would also keep Northern Ireland in the customs union of the EU, as long insisted by the bloc. 
Lidington also said the British government would stand by the written commitments it had already made on the backstop, which include an agreement that it would apply unless and until a better solution is found.

The EU has suggested that the tweaked ""two-tier"" backstop covering all of the UK could give mainland Britain some scope to set its own trade rules while keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU.

The post was part of a belt of strongholds built around Ghazni, which is on the main road between the capital, Kabul, and the Afghan south, after the city was briefly overrun by Taliban in August in one of their biggest offensives in years.
As well as the 13 killed, 13 members of the Western-backed government's security forces were wounded in the attack, said Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor.
He said the Taliban had suffered heavy casualties but he had no exact information.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement 18 policemen were killed and six wounded and large quantities of weapons and ammunition were seized.
The attack is only the latest indication of the precarious security around Ghazni following the big Taliban assault in August, which shocked the government and was only repelled with the help of U.S. air strikes and special force troops.
A U.S. watchdog agency said last week the Afghan government was struggling to recover control of districts lost to the Taliban while casualties among security forces had reached record levels.
The government had control or influence over 65 percent of the population but only 55.5 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts, the agency, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, said in a report.
The latest phase of Afghanistan's decades of war began in late 2001, when U.S.-led troops overthrew the Taliban in response to the Sept. 11 attacks that year on the United States.

After months of political deadlock the house speaker said it was time for parliament to vote on a candidate after both Kristersson and caretaker Prime Minister Stefan Lofven were unable to hammer out a ruling coalition.
""Right now, there are absolutely no guarantees that Ulf Kristersson will be elected,"" Speaker Andreas Norlen told a news conference in parliament.
The vote will be held on Nov. 14.
Kristersson has already tried and failed in informal talks to persuade all four parties in his center-right Alliance bloc to support him as prime minister. He also failed to get support for a smaller, right-wing government that would need support from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.
""The process has to go forward,"" Norlen told reporters. 
The general election on Sept. 9 left the center-left and center-right blocs evenly balanced and the Sweden Democrats holding the balance of power.
Neither bloc has been willing to give the Sweden Democrats a say in policy due to their white supremacist roots.

SYDNEY/BEIJING (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne will travel to China this week, the two governments announced on Monday, as China ended an unofficial suspension for more than six months of visits by top Australian government ministers.
Ties between the two countries, which compete for influence in Asia and particularly in the Pacific, have been strained since Australia accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs late last year.
Ending the stand-off, China's foreign ministry said Payne's visit, which begins on Wednesday, will include talks with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
Her trip is being seen in Australia as a bid by China to seek warmer ties with Australia's recently installed Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
""I am looking forward to discussions with Minister Wang to enhance bilateral understanding and cooperation across the full range of Australia's interests, spanning strategic, economic and people-to-people connections,"" Payne said in a statement.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying noted that Payne and Wang had met in September on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and had reached ""an important consensus"" on ties.
""We are willing to work hard with the Australian side on the basis of mutual respect, equality and benefit to expand exchanges and cooperation in all fields, to promote Sino-Australian relations to achieve new developments,"" Hua told reporters. 
In August, Morrison become Australia's sixth different prime minister in the last decade after a backbench revolt ousted his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, who criticized China and banned its Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] from Australia's broadband network.
Morrison has steered clear of foreign affairs.
""Morrison has been entirely focused on domestic politics, avoiding a lot of Turnbull's foreign policy. No doubt this has been warmly received by China,"" said Michael O'Keefe, head of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne.
Signs of warmer ties will cheer Australia's business community after the diplomatic row spilled over to hit two-way trade, most notably, sales of Australian wine.
Australian wine shipments, including those produced by Treasury Wine Estates and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), in June experienced temporary Chinese custom delays.
China is Australia's top goods and services trading partner, accounting for 24 percent, or A$183.4 billion ($131.88 billion), of total trade in 2017, according to data from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
""China sees an opportunity to seek a reset of the bilateral relationship on its preferred terms,"" John Lee, previous foreign minister Julie Bishop's former principle adviser, told Reuters.
China never officially announced a block on visits by Australian officials but in June, Australia asked China to facilitate a visit for Bishop to travel for biennial talks with her counterpart.

China never formally responded and Bishop never made the trip.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will sell its oil and break sanctions reimposed by the United States on its vital energy and banking sectors, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday.
""America wanted to cut to zero Iran's oil sales ... but we will continue to sell our oil ... to break sanctions,"" Rouhani told economists at a meeting broadcast live on state television.
The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it re-imposes sanctions on Monday aimed at forcing Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities.
China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey - all top importers of Iranian oil - are among eight countries expected to be given temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilised.
The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. 
""Today the enemy (the United States) is targeting our economy ... the main target of sanctions is our people,"" Rouhani said. 
In May, Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and Washington reimposed first round of sanctions on Iran in August. 
The deal had seen most international financial and economic sanctions on Iran lifted in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under U.N. surveillance.
""ECONOMIC WAR"" 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the penalties set to return on Monday ""are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran.""
However, Iran's clerical rulers have dismissed concerns about the impact of sanctions on the country's economy.
""This is an economic war against Iran but ... America should learn that it can not use the language of force against Iran ... We are prepared to resist any pressure,"" Rouhani said.
To keep the deal alive, the remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal are trying to maintain trade with Tehran despite scepticism this is possible despite U.S. sanctions to choke off Iranian oil sales. 
Diplomats told Reuters last month that the new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian oil exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4 but not operational until early next year. 
They cautioned, however, that no country had volunteered to host the entity, which was delaying the process.
""We are in regular contact with other signatories of the nuclear deal ... setting up (a) mechanism to continue trade with the European Union will take time,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told a weekly news conference on in Tehran.

He also said the reimposed U.S. sanctions were part of a psychological war launched by Washington against Tehran, adding that ""America's economic pressure on Iran is futile.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Floyd Mayweather's route to boxing greatness has been carefully crafted without taking unnecessary risks, yet his announcement of a fight for a Japanese mixed martial arts organization later this month could be his biggest gamble yet. 
Mayweather's last bout was a comprehensive boxing victory over Irish MMA star Conor McGregor in August 2017, but the American was back in the spotlight on Monday when he agreed to top the bill on the Rizin Fighting Federation's next card.
His opponent, young Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, is unbeaten in four MMA fights, although both Mayweather and Rizin revealed that the exact rules of the Dec. 31 Saitama showdown were still under negotiation.
If Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters to ever step into a boxing ring, does decide to try his hand at something new, he will need protection from the more extreme elements of cage fighting if he is to make any impact.
Despite being 41-years-old, his hands still pack a potent punch, but the addition of elbows, knees, kicks and grappling in MMA represent a huge challenge for a boxer boasting an unblemished 50-0 record dating back to 1996. 
Throughout his professional career, the American was famed for his defensive skills, with his precise footwork and elusive head movement making him an almost impossible target for even the best in the world to land a glove on. 
But as his ""Money"" nickname and social media activity showing off his love of an opulent lifestyle indicate, his career has ceased to be all about belts and titles. 
He is a self-made marketing machine and his ground-breaking bout against two-weight Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion McGregor also illustrates a creative approach to maximizing his value. 
Mayweather now appears to have eschewed a lucrative boxing rematch against long-time Filipino rival Manny Pacquiao in favor of a play for a cross-over MMA audience, many of whom had abandoned boxing for the more visceral thrills of the octagon. 
His fight against McGregor in Las Vegas turned into a full-blown media circus and his 10th-round TKO gave fans their money's worth, on the surface at least. 
FINANCIAL MIGHT
A talented-but-limited amateur, McGregor had no business being in the ring with a boxer of Mayweather's caliber, and his shortcomings were soon exposed. When the American turned up the heat late in the fight, the brash Irishman had no response. 
In the cage, it would have been a very different story.  
There are six different punches in boxing, and had McGregor been able to call on a striking arsenal consisting of kicks and elbows, plus his grappling skills, the outcome would most likely have been a quick and painful defeat for Mayweather. 
The boxer arrives at Rizin with no grappling background to speak of and Brazilian jiu-jitsu -- the martial art that forms the backbone of MMA exchanges -- cannot be perfected quickly. 
A black belt in the sport can take 10 years or more to acquire. 
Mayweather's possible conversion to a cage fighter will provide a fascinating spectacle, and the tantalizing prospect of a possible second meeting with McGregor, this time in an octagon, would send fans of both sports into a frenzy. 
However, if such a contest does happen, the sporting spectacle itself will have little chance of matching the hype likely to precede it.
Mayweather possesses enormous financial might and it has almost become a ritual for fighters seeking a bumper payday and media exposure to call him out, as UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov did after he submitted McGregor last month. 
It may simply be that he is trying to maintain the crossover audience he created with McGregor, and that the Rizin bout will simply be boxing in a cage, rather than a ring. 

But as with everything in modern combat sports, money -- and in this instance ""Money"" Mayweather -- will ultimately call the shots.

The move will restore U.S. sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by the administration of President Barack Obama, and add 300 new designations in Iran's oil, shipping, insurance and banking sectors.
President Donald Trump announced in May that his administration was withdrawing from what he called the ""worst ever"" agreement negotiated by the United States. Other parties to the deal, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, have said they will not leave. 
Details of the sanctions will be released at a news conference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey - all top importers of Iranian oil - are among eight countries expected to be given temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilized.
The countries will deposit Iran's revenue in an escrow account, U.S. officials have said. 
Washington has said it will ensure a well supplied global oil market, with help from ally Saudi Arabia, as Iran oil is cut back. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $72.53 per barrel on Monday.
The reimposition of the sanctions comes as the United States is focused on U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections on Tuesday. Campaigning in Chattanooga, Tennessee, late on Sunday, Trump said his ""maximum pressure"" policy against Iran was working. 
""Iran is a much different country than it was when I took office,"" said Trump, adding: ""They wanted to take over the whole Middle East. Right now they just want to survive.""
Earlier, thousands of Iranians chanted ""Death to America"" at a rally to mark the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Iran should implement policies to safeguard its macroeconomic stability in the face of sanctions.
Senior Iranian officials have dismissed concerns about the impact to its economy.

""America will not be able to carry out any measure against our great and brave nation ... We have the knowledge and the capability to manage the country's economic affairs,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV on Friday.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Reuters reporters in Myanmar appeal against conviction in state secrets case,"YANGON (Reuters) - Lawyers for two Reuters reporters jailed for seven years in Myanmar lodged an appeal on Monday against their conviction on charges of breaking the country's Official Secrets Act.
The appeal cited evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime.
""We filed an appeal ... because the trial court's ruling was wrong,"" said Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief, Stephen J. Adler in a statement. ""In condemning them as spies, it ignored compelling evidence of a police set-up, serious due process violations, and the prosecution's failure to prove any of the key elements of the crime.""
(Read the full appeal in English, https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pf5Vny)
(Read the full appeal in Burmese, https://tmsnrt.rs/2P9ouct)
He added the court shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and called on Myanmar to ""uphold its stated dedication to rule of law, freedom of the press, and democracy by ordering the release of our colleagues.""
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were found guilty in September after a trial at a Yangon district court in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress toward democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. In comments made the week after their conviction, she said they had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists"".
Government spokesman Zaw Htay declined comment on the appeal.
Defence lawyers filed the appeal on Monday morning at the Yangon-based High Court. If the court rules to allow the appeal, an appellate judge would take written and oral arguments from prosecution and defense lawyers before handing down a decision. 
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August last year. The operation sent more than 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.
During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up in a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers.

On Feb. 1, a police witness said under cross-examination that information in the documents had already been published in newspapers. In April, a prosecution witness testified that a senior officer had ordered subordinates to plant documents on Wa Lone to ""trap"" the reporter.

A total of 250 children in elementary school, middle school and high school killed themselves in the fiscal year through March, up from 245 the previous year, according to a ministry survey. That was the highest since 1986, when 268 students took their own lives.
""The number of suicides of students have stayed high, and that is an alarming issue which should be tackled,"" said ministry official Noriaki Kitazaki.
It is difficult to determine the factors behind the increase, he said.
Out of the 250 cases, 33 children were reported to have had concerns about their future, 31 had family problems, 10 were bullied, while 140 were unknown, the survey showed.
High school students in Japan typically graduate at age 18.
Across all age groups, the number of suicides in Japan has fallen to 21,321 in 2017 from a peak of 34,427 in 2003, according to the National Police Agency.

SEOUL (Reuters) - About 500 United States and South Korean marines began small-scale military drills on Monday, just days before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to hold talks with North Korea on denuclearization and plans for a second summit of their leaders. 
The Korean Marine Exchange Program was among the training drills indefinitely suspended in June after U.S. President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore and promised to end joint, U.S.-South Korea military exercises.
Although larger exercises were suspended, the two countries have continued small-scale drills, the South's Ministry of National Defense said on Monday, adding that the marines were holding a training round near the southern city of Pohang. 
Pompeo, interviewed on broadcaster CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" said on Sunday he would be in New York City at the end of this week to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol.
""I expect we’ll make some real progress, including an effort to make sure that the summit between our two leaders can take place, where we can make substantial steps towards denuclearization,"" he added.
In Washington last week, South Korea's defence minister said the two countries would decide by December on major joint military exercises for 2019. Vigilant Ace, suspended this month, is one of several such exercises halted to encourage dialogue with Pyongyang, which has criticised joint U.S.-South Korea exercises in the past.
The biggest combat-readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan has gone ahead, however, with nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan joining Japanese destroyers and a Canadian warship in the ocean off Japan, another key player in the effort to pressure North Korea.
This week's exercises follow a warning by North Korea on Friday that it could resume development of its nuclear programme if the United States did not drop its campaign of ""maximum pressure"" and sanctions. 
""The improvement of relations and sanctions are incompatible,"" a foreign ministry official said in a statement released through state-run KCNA news agency.
""The U.S. thinks that its oft-repeated 'sanctions and pressure' lead to 'denuclearization.' We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea.""
South Korea hopes the North and the United States will make ""big progress"" during the talks set for this week, presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said on Monday, but declined to comment on the North's Friday statement. 
North Korea has not tested a ballistic missile or nuclear weapon for nearly a year, and has said it has shuttered its main nuclear test site with plans to dismantle several more facilities.
In recent weeks, North Korea has pressed harder for what it sees as reciprocal concessions by the United States and other countries.
""As shown, the U.S. is totally to blame for all the problems on the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear issue and therefore, the very one that caused all those must untie the knot it made,"" it said on Friday.
American officials have remained sceptical of Kim's commitment to give up his nuclear arsenal, however, and Washington says it will not support easing international sanctions until more verified progress is made.
Pompeo, interviewed on television's ""Fox News Sunday,"" said the Trump administration wants a full, verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, adding that Trump insisted on ""no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective.""

South Korean President Moon Jae-in's continuing efforts to engage with North Korea have fanned U.S. concerns that Seoul could weaken pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",First wave of Central American migrants arrive in Mexico City,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The first Central American migrants from a caravan traveling through Mexico toward the United States in hopes of seeking asylum arrived in Mexico City on Sunday, taking up temporary shelter at a sports stadium.
More than 1,000 Central Americans, many fleeing gang violence and financial hardship in their home countries, bedded down at the stadium where the city government set up medical aid and food kitchens.
Ahead of U.S. congressional elections this Tuesday, President Donald Trump has warned repeatedly about the advance of the caravan and ordered thousands of troops to the Mexican border, where units strung up razor wire this weekend. 
The migrants arrived in the capital, nearly 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the closest border crossings in Texas, four weeks after setting out from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula.
""Our heads are set at getting to the United States, to fulfill the American dream,"" said Mauricio Mancilla, who traveled with his six-year old son from San Pedro Sula. ""We have faith in God that we will do this, whatever the circumstances.""
Thousands more Central Americans were moving in groups in the Gulf state of Veracruz, the central state of Puebla and in the southern state of Chiapas, local media reported.
""This is an exodus,"" Alejandro Solalinde, a Catholic priest and migrant rights activist, told reporters. ""It's without precedent.""
The U.S. government has pressured Mexico to halt the advance of the migrants and President Enrique Pena Nieto has offered temporary identification papers and jobs if they register for asylum in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. 
Mexico's government said on Saturday it was processing nearly 2,800 asylum requests and that around 1,100 Central Americans had been deported.
At the capital's famed shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, a group of Mexican volunteers called out on bullhorns, offering bus rides to migrants to the stadium.
Cesar Gomez, a 20-year old Guatemalan, said he jumped at joining the caravan to avoid the dangers of traveling alone and paying thousands of dollars to human smugglers.

""This was a good opportunity,"" he said as he waited for a ride. ""The first thing is to try for the United States. If not, maybe I will stay here.""

The newspaper said Raab made the pitch to Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The European Union and Ireland want guarantees there will be no physical structures delimiting the land border between the Irish republic and the British province of Northern Ireland after Britain leaves the EU, if negotiations fail to regulate the issue.
Raab's plan would give UK the right to ask for a ""review mechanism"" within three or six months of the so-called backstop taking effect, to allow it to continue only by mutual consent, the Financial Times reported early on Monday.
Raab has written to Prime Minister Theresa May to urge her to back his plan, the FT said, quoting a person briefed on the matter.

The Telegraph said the proposal was ""apparently contradicted"" by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington on a visit to Dublin. Raab's department said it did not comment on private meetings.

The death of Brent Taylor, mayor of North Ogden and a member of the Utah National Guard, was confirmed by Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox, who posted a tribute on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""I hate this,"" Cox wrote. ""I'm struggling for words. I love Mayor Taylor, his amazing wife Jennie and his 7 sweet kids.""
Taylor had left his position in North Ogden, a city of around 17,000 people about 45 miles (70 km) north of Salt Lake City, earlier this year to serve in Afghanistan. It was his fourth deployment, according to The Deseret News, a Utah newspaper.
The NATO-led mission in Afghanistan said in a statement on Saturday that a U.S. armed forces member was killed but did not identify him.
""Initial reports indicate the attacker was a member of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Initial reports also indicate the attacker was immediately killed by other Afghan Forces,"" the mission said in a statement.
The attack was the latest in a series of ""green-on-blue"" incidents in which members of the Afghan forces have killed U.S. or coalition advisers this year, and it followed the death of a Czech soldier in the western province of Herat last month.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in September that training and vetting of Afghan forces was being stepped up to minimize such attacks, and that some training and advisory operations have been scaled back while security is assessed.
Last month, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller, escaped unhurt when the bodyguard of a provincial governor opened fire on a group of U.S. and Afghan officials in the southern province of Kandahar. 
A week ago, Taylor urged Americans to vote in Tuesday's congressional elections, saying he hoped ""whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.""

Under the peace treaty, two border areas were recognized to be under Jordanian sovereignty but gave Israel special provisions to use the land and allow Israelis free access.
Jordan formally notified Israel two weeks ago it would not renew the 25-year deal over Baquora where the Yarmouk River flows into the Jordan River and in the Ghumar area in the southern Wadi Araba desert where Israeli farmers have large plantations.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told Reuters after the decision the kingdom was waiting for Israel to invoke a provision in the peace treaty to hold consultations after giving notice before the deadline.
Petra state news agency quoted government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat as saying Jordan had received the Israeli request but did not say when the discussions would begin.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Jordan's move and said his country sought to enter negotiations on the possibility of extending the arrangement.
The 25-year special regime would be automatically renewed unless either of the parties notified the other a year before expiry that it wished to terminate the agreement.
Safadi said the deal, which was signed in November 1994, had been conceived as a temporary arrangement from the start. The kingdom had contemplated the move for a while before the Nov. 10 deadline.
King Abdullah, who stressed the territories were Jordanian lands and would remain so, said the move was made in the ""national interest"" at a period of regional turmoil. 

Jordan is one of only two Arab states that has a peace treaty with Israel and the two countries have a long history of close security ties. But the treaty is unpopular in Jordan where pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's conservative government has lost its parliamentary majority after an independent candidate was on Monday confirmed the winner in a critical by-election.
Voters in the wealthy seaside constituency of Wentworth, in Sydney's east, went to the polls on Oct 20 to chose a replacement for former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who quit politics in August after he was ousted by his own party.
Widespread voter anger at Turnbull's demise saw the ruling Liberal party haemorrhage votes, though the race narrowed to come down to a several thousand postal votes.
After two weeks of counting, the Australian Electoral Commission said Kerryn Phelps, an independent, had been elected after a 20 percent swing against the ruling government.
""This is the moment when the Australian people said there is something very wrong with the party political system,"" Phelps told reporters in Sydney.
""The people of Wentworth have spoken. They have spoken loud and clear, and I have heard their message. I hope that the rest of the parliament hears their message too."" 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is now left relying on the support of six independents to prevent a no confidence vote that would trigger an early election. 
Morrison must return to the polls by May 2019, with the opposition Labor party set for a landslide victory, polls show.
Lagging well behind in the polls, Morrison has moved swiftly to satisfy the demands of several independents by quietly beginning to evacuate child refugees from one of Australia's remote Pacific detention centres.
Under Australia's tough border control policy, asylum seekers arriving by boat will never be allowed to settle in the country and are detained in two Pacific detention centres until they are accepted by another country or agree to return home.

While aid agencies have called for the removal of the more than 1,000 refugees held for more than five years, Morrison is under immense pressure to resettle 40 children currently held on Nauru amid warnings they are suffering from declining mental health.

In an interview with CNN, Salah and Abdullah Khashoggi said that without their father's body, their family is unable to grieve and deal with the emotional burden of their father's death.
""It's not a normal situation, it's not a normal death at all. All what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi (cemetery) in Medina (Saudi Arabia) with the rest of his family,"" Salah Khashoggi said. ""I talked about that with the Saudi authorities and I just hope that it happens soon.""
Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Saudi authorities have admitted that Khashoggi was murdered in a premeditated action, revising previous statements that his death was unintended. Turkish officials and some U.S. lawmakers have said that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered the murder, an allegation that Riyadh denies.
Khashoggi's body has not been recovered, and Saudi authorities are conducting an official investigation. 
Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an international businessman, said on Sunday that the probe will exonerate the country's leader.
Salah Khashoggi on Oct. 24 met in Riyadh with the crown prince and King Salman to receive condolences along with other Khashoggi family members. Salah departed for Washington a day later, and his CNN interview was his first public comments since then.
He said King Salman assured him that those involved in Jamal Khashoggi's murder would be brought to justice.
""We just need to make sure that he rests in peace,"" Salah Khashoggi said of his father. ""Until now, I still can't believe that he's dead. It's not sinking in with me emotionally,"" he said, adding that there has been a lot of ""misinformation"" about the circumstances of the death.
Salah said that charges that his father was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood organization were not true. 
Asked how Khashoggi should be remembered, Salah replied, ""As a moderate man who has common values with everyone ... a man who loved his country, who believed so much in it and its potential.""

""Jamal was never a dissident. He believed in the monarchy, that it is the thing that is keeping the country together. And he believed in the transformation that it is going through.""

It was the first government shuffle in Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas producer, since early 2016, but diplomats and analysts said the changes did not represent a significant shift in power.
The wealthy country has been subject to a diplomatic and economic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism and cozying up to Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.
Qatar's ruler issued decrees outlining changes to the boards of state gas giant Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the world's ninth largest sovereign wealth fund with about $300 billion in assets.
Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was named chairman of QIA, which injected billions of dollars into Qatari banks last year to offset foreign outflows just after the Arab boycott began.
Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Thani, the 30-year-old deputy and brother of the emir, was named chairman of Qatar Petroleum, which expects to ramp up gas production by some 43 percent over the next five to six years.
Though limited, the cabinet shuffle pulled in business heavyweights like Qatar National Bank (QNB) CEO Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari, who was appointed to a new portfolio combining commerce and industry under one ministry.
Saad al-Kaabi, the chief executive of QP, was named minister of state for energy affairs. New ministers were appointed to head the departments of justice, of labor and social affairs, and of municipality and environment.
Western diplomats and analysts did not see the shake-up as indicative of a shift in policy nearly 18 months since the start of the regional rift, which Qatar has weathered with new trade routes and higher oil prices that have helped it swing to a budgetary surplus this year. 
""The cabinet shuffle was expected to come earlier, but was apparently on hold as the country dealt with the blockade and now as the ramifications have been successfully dealt with, it was time,"" said Majed al-Ansari, an analyst and professor of political sociology at Qatar University.
""It does not signal a change in policy or power shift in the government,"" he said. 
It was not clear whether Kuwari would retain his post at QNB, the Middle East's largest lender by assets. The bank, which is 50 percent owned by the country's sovereign wealth fund, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
QP's Al-Kaabi, a U.S.-educated engineer, rose through the ranks to become chief executive in 2014 and also sits on the board of the Qatar Investment Authority. 
He has gained a reputation among executives of the world's energy majors, such as Exxon (N:XOM), Shell (L:RDSa) and  Total  (PA:TOTF), as a reliable counterpart for energy projects that have made the tiny nation of 2.6 million people the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Abdulla Abdulaziz Al Subaie was appointed minister of municipality and environment, a post seen as key to preparations for the country's 2022 World Cup. Subaie has served as managing director and CEO of Qatar Rail, which expects to launch Doha's first metro line this year.

A separate decree on Sunday appointed Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Thani chairman of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority as part of a shuffle of its board of directors.

Online news site Sabq said the king would launch health, education and infrastructure projects, but few other details were immediately available.
The tour comes as Saudi Arabia faces an international outcry over Khashoggi's murder a month ago in its consulate in Istanbul. Riyadh initially denied any role in his disappearance, but under pressure from Turkish authorities it eventually identified 18 suspects in the case.
It was not immediately clear if the king's powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would be participating in the tour.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order to kill Khashoggi came from the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government but that he did not believe King Salman was behind it.
Riyadh has blamed Khashoggi's death on a ""rogue operation"", and said the crown prince had no knowledge of the killing.

King Salman has taken a more hands-on role in Saudi policy after delegating vast powers to Prince Mohammed, who has embarked on sweeping social and economic reforms but has marginalized some senior royals and overseen a crackdown on dissent.

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - For Brazil's right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, attacking critical press outlets almost daily on social media is not enough. Once in office, he vows to hit their bottom line.
With half a billion dollars in public-sector marketing budgets coming under his discretion, the fiery former Army captain is threatening to slash ad buys with adversarial media groups, striking at the financial foundations of Brazil's free press. 
After a campaign in which Bolsonaro dismissed investigative reporting as ""fake news"" invented by a corrupt establishment and his supporters went after individual journalists, the threats are sending a chill through the country's newsrooms.
Asked in a TV interview last week if he would respect press freedom even for his favorite foil, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil's largest circulation daily, Bolsonaro's answer was curt.
""That newspaper is done,"" Bolsonaro said in a tense TV Globo interview. ""As far as I'm concerned with government advertising — press that acts like that, lying shamelessly, won't have any support from the federal government.""
While public funds are just a fraction of revenue at most major media groups, the prospect of a president out to punish unfriendly coverage has put many reporters on edge.
Several seasoned journalists working for Brazil's biggest news organizations told Reuters in recent weeks they have started to throttle back their criticism, fearing backlash from a Bolsonaro government — and violence from his supporters.
Brazilian press watchdogs said there has been an escalation of threats and aggression against reporters. Investigative journalism group Abraji began tracking the incidents in Brazil's most polarized election since the return to democratic government in 1985 after two decades of military dictatorship. 
Most of the attacks on journalists were by Bolsonaro supporters, according to Abraji, which recorded more than 150 cases of campaign reporters coming under threat. Roughly half involved physical violence and the rest were online hate campaigns.
""Treating the press as an antagonist is not a new tactic, but the aggressive tone and frequency of Bolsonaro's attacks are very worrying,"" said the group's coordinator, Marina Atoji.
Bolsonaro's supporters said the Brazilian media has a leftist bias and they have turned to social media for news about him. 
""The worst thing was they tried to crucify Bolsonaro for his controversial statements on women, gays and blacks,"" said Emilio Kerber, an Air Force major who ran for Congress in Bolsonaro's small coalition. ""But Bolsonaro has millions of followers on social media and he won anyway.""
Press aides for Bolsonaro did not respond to a request for comment. The president-elect has disavowed any supporters who resort to violence. He said he respects freedom of the press and only asks that it be exercised responsibly.
PRICE TO PAY
In Folha's newsroom, the sense of siege is palpable. 
Executive Editor Sérgio Dávila said in an interview the paper has taken security measures to protect its reporters after a social media barrage by Bolsonaro supporters over reporting on his campaign's use of messaging platform WhatsApp.
""This is the most tense recent election, because the massive use of social media has meant journalists are more exposed to the supporters of the candidates,"" he said.
""Bolsonaro voters are particularly active on social media,"" Dávila said, adding that he had never seen such vitriol directed at individual journalists over specific stories.
After his victory on Sunday, Bolsonaro said media groups that spread lies will miss out on federal government advertising, which totaled 1.8 billion reais ($487 million) in 2017, including ads by state enterprises.
TV Globo, which has long dominated Brazilian media and shaped public debate with its vast audience, receives less than 4 percent of its annual revenue from government funding, the group said in a statement. Folha said public-sector advertising was less than 5 percent of revenue. 
OPPORTUNITY
Still, many smaller media groups have embraced Bolsonaro with friendly interviews and less aggressive coverage. 
That has stoked tensions at some outlets.
At Radio Guaiba in the city of Porto Alegre, veteran broadcaster Juremir Machado walked out of the studio on the air for what he called censorship at the end of an interview with Bolsonaro. He said he was not allowed to ask any questions and quit the program.
After billionaire media mogul and preacher Edir Macedo threw his support behind Bolsonaro, his Record TV network increased coverage of the right-winger's rallies. It stepped up criticism of leftist challenger Fernando Haddad and played up stories of corruption in his Workers Party, said one former employee, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.
Grupo Record did not respond to a request for comment. 
Its network raised eyebrows three days before the first-round vote by broadcasting an exclusive interview with Bolsonaro at the very same time of a presidential debate on rival channel TV Globo that the candidate declined to attend for medical reasons. That night, the Record TV newscast had its best audience of the year to date. 
Other outlets are finding there is an audience for more aggressive coverage. Dávila, the Folha editor, said in recent weeks the paper has seen a spike in subscriptions. 
""It wasn't something we asked for. It wasn't a campaign organized by the newspaper,"" Dávila said.
""They basically said: 'Folha does critical journalism. Bolsonaro is attacking Folha. I'm going to subscribe to Folha out of solidarity.'""

Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October.
Saudi Arabia should publicly release the findings of the murder investigation which would surely exonerate Saudi Arabia's leader, Prince Alwaleed said on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
""I ask Saudi Arabia now publicly, through your program, to have the investigation made public as soon as possible,"" he said. ""I believe the Saudi crown prince will be 100 percent vindicated and exonerated.""
Prince Alwaleed was detained last year with dozens of other wealthy Saudis in a move by the crown prince to consolidate power and reform the country. 
On Sunday, Prince Alwaleed said his detention was ""forgiven and forgotten.""
The crown prince's allies have said last year's crackdown was a fight against corruption and Prince Alwaleed agreed.
""Thank God that, after this incident, many of those that were detained had a big cleaning process,"" he said.
Prince Alwaleed was freed from Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel along with other royals, senior officials and businessmen, most of whom reached financial settlements with the authorities.

Prince Alwaleed denied reports that he had been tortured in custody and that officials stripped him of his wealth.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 02:43PM ET</span>",Sri Lanka's president summons parliament on Nov. 14 as pressure over PM's sacking grows,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered the suspended parliament to reconvene on Nov. 14, clearing the way for a vote on his decision to sack the elected prime minister and replace him with wartime nationalist Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
Sirisena abruptly fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Oct.26 and appointed former president Rajapaksa to lead the ruling coalition instead, raising fears at home and abroad that this could derail Sri Lanka's halting national reconciliation process. 
Wickremesinghe says his dismissal is unconstitutional. His United National Party submitted a motion to that effect to parliament but Sirisena suspended its session until Nov. 16, citing a need for Rajapaksa to make arrangements for the new government prevented the vote. 
Sirisena's decree for the house to reconvene on Nov. 14 was published in the official gazette on Sunday. 
It was not clear if and when the 225-member parliament would vote on the UNP's motion that Wickremesinghe's dismissal was illegal.
Rajapaksa led Sri Lanka to a military defeat of Tamil separatist guerrillas in 2009 but has since faced widespread allegations of human rights abuse and targeting of Tamil civilians. 
Wickremesinghe told Reuters earlier on Sunday that the United States and Japan had frozen more than a billion dollars of development aid after his abrupt dismissal raised doubts about the future of democracy in the island.
This follows a warning from the EU that it could withdraw duty-free concessions for Sri Lankan exports if it didn't stick to commitments on national reconciliation.
Sirisena's summons comes after Wickremesinghe's UNP said on Friday that 118 lawmakers had met the speaker to demand parliament be allowed to convene.
Before Wickremesinghe's dismissal, the UNP held 107 seats. Of those, eight have defected to support Rajapaksa. One out of 16 Tamil MPs also joined Rajapaksa.
Among the causes for the animosity between Wickremesinghe and Sirisena is Wickremesinghe's refusal to back the president's bid to stand in the next election in late 2019. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe's government of not taking seriously an alleged assassination plot against him.

Rushing water filled the villa in Casteldaccia in the province of Palermo in moments, wiping out the families who were spending Saturday night there.
A father and his daughter escaped harm because they had left the house to do some shopping while a third person climbed a tree to survive.
The tragedy brings the number of people killed in Sicily this weekend to at least 12 after three other people died in their cars when hit by torrents of water.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte spoke of ""an immense tragedy"" during a visit on Sunday to affected areas in Sicily. 
He said a cabinet meeting would be convened this week to declare a state of emergency and come up with the first package of aid for areas affected.
Heavy rains and gale-force winds have battered Italy for several days, uprooting millions of trees and cutting off villages and roads.
Italy's Civil Protection Agency said deaths caused by the wave of bad weather stood at 17, excluding the fatalities in Sicily.
Some of the worst damage has been recorded in the northern regions of Trentino and Veneto. 
On Saturday the governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said storm damage in the region amounted to at least a billion euros.
During a visit on Sunday to badly-hit areas in the north, Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said 250 million euros ($285 million) had already been earmarked for relief.
He said the government would be asking to use special EU funds.
Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, said a rough estimate of how much it would cost to safeguard Italy against such events was 40 billion euros.

The pipeline carries crude across Iraqi Kurdistan and connects to a metering station in Fish-Khabur near the Turkish and Syrian borders, before feeding another pipeline that takes the crude to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for export.
""This extra capacity will accommodate future production growth from KRG (Kurdistan Regional Government) producing fields, and can also be used by the federal government (in Baghdad) to export the currently stranded oil in Kirkuk and surrounding areas,"" the ministry's statement said.
The KRG currently exports over 400,000 bpd of crude oil, it said.
Exports from oilfields in Kirkuk have been on hold since Iraqi government forces took control of them from the Kurds last year in retaliation for a Kurdish referendum on independence which was widely opposed by Turkey, Iran and Western powers.
Kurdistan has built the pipeline for Kirkuk exports to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan after the old Kirkuk pipeline belonging to the federal government had been damaged by Islamic State militants.

The blast came a day after the assassination of a local council leader in the city, the former Syrian capital of the militant group's self-declared caliphate, which was seized a year ago by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters. 
Raqqa security forces said a civilian had been killed and several people, including civilians and fighters injured. The war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the blast caused ""a large number"" of casualties. 
Islamic State said in a statement that it had detonated the bomb, targeting fighters from the Kurdish YPG militia, the strongest element in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group that drove the militants from Raqqa last year.
The SDF is battling Islamic State fighters in one of their last patches of territory in Syria, along the north bank of the Euphrates river close to the Iraqi border. 
The militants took advantage of bad weather on Sunday to attack SDF positions, killing a dozen fighters, the Observatory reported. 
Syrian state television reported on Sunday that the Syrian army was assaulting the jihadists' other remaining pocket of ground in the desert area in Sweida province in southern Syria.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - The United States has warned its citizens in Tanzania to be cautious after the commercial capital Dar es Salaam announced a crackdown on homosexuality, a criminal offense in the country.
In an alert on its website late on Saturday, the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania advised Americans to review their social media profiles and internet footprints. 
""Remove or protect images and language that may run afoul of Tanzanian laws regarding homosexual practices and explicit sexual activity,"" it said. 
The alert said any U.S. citizen who was detained or arrested should ensure the Tanzanian authorities informed the embassy. 
Dar es Salaam's administrative chief Paul Makonda said on Wednesday that a special committee would seek to identify and punish homosexuals, prostitutes and online fraudsters in the city from this week. 
The foreign ministry said Makonda was voicing his own opinion and the planned crackdown did not have national government support.
""The government of the United Republic of Tanzania would like to clarify that those are his own views and not the government position,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Last October, at least 12 men were arrested at a Dar es Salaam hotel in a raid on a gathering which authorities said was to promote same-sex relationships.
President John Magufuli has cracked down on homosexuality since winning power in 2015, and a conviction for having ""carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature"" could lead to a sentence of up to 30 years in jail.
Homosexuality remains taboo across much of Africa and gay people face discrimination or persecution, with rights groups often reluctant to speak publicly in defense of gay rights. 

In 2016, Tanzania banned non-governmental organizations from distributing free lubricants to gays as part of efforts to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, even though some health experts warn that shutting down such outreach programs could put the wider population at higher risk of infection.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",Merkel's conservatives quarrel over party's course,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) argued on Sunday over whether they should return to a more conservative agenda once she steps down as party chair as contenders to succeed her gear up for the leadership race.
Support for their Social Democrats (SPD) coalition partner meanwhile hit a record low, according to a poll published hours before senior members of both the CDU and the SPD were due to discuss the parties' future courses in closed-door meetings.
Merkel announced last week that she would step down as CDU party leader in December, ending an era of nearly two decades in which she shifted Germany's most powerful party gradually from the right to the center.
Her decision followed two regional votes in which Merkel's center-right bloc and the left-leaning SPD suffered their worst election results in decades while the ecologist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained support.
Health Minister Jens Spahn, one of the three contenders to replace Merkel as party leader, said the CDU had watered down its profile by becoming too centrist in the past years.
""Parties must differ from another again more strongly,"" Spahn told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. ""The way we view people and society is fundamentally different from the one of the Social Democrats,"" he added.
Spahn is one of the fiercest critics of Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million refugees, mainly Muslims from war zones in the Middle East.
Spahn ruled out a coalition with the anti-immigration AfD, saying the CDU could not work together with a party he called anti-American and which he said idolizes Russian autocrats.
CDU deputy chair Armin Laschet warned against moving the CDU more to the right. ""I'm convinced that such a policy shift would be wrong,"" Laschet told Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily. The CDU should stick to its centrist course, he added.
Speaking to reporters shortly before the CDU board meeting in Berlin, Laschet and CDU deputy leader Julia Kloeckner both suggested that the candidates to succeed Merkel should present themselves in several regional conferences in the coming weeks.
LEADERSHIP RACE
The candidate most likely to stand for a continuation of Merkel's centrist course is CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer who is expected to comment on her candidacy in the coming days.
The third candidate is Friedrich Merz who would stand for a shift towards the low-tax, business-friendly right-wing conservatism that Merkel has pushed into the background.
The CDU seems to be split over its leadership question. An Emnid poll for Bild am Sonntag showed that 44 percent of party members backed Merz and 39 percent favored Kramp-Karrenbauer. Support for Spahn was at 9 percent.
SPD deputy chair Ralf Stegner said his party would not remain in the coalition ""at any price"".
""If the coalition does not drastically and rapidly change its work mode and image, it cannot and will not last,"" he said.
A Forsa poll for RTL/n-tv broadcasters showed on Sunday that support for the SPD plunged to a record low of 13 percent while Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc rose to 27 percent.

The pro-immigration Greens jumped to 24 percent to become the second-strongest party, the poll showed. The AfD fell to 13 percent while the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the party The Left both stood at 9 percent.

The eastern Mediterranean is believed to be rich in natural gas, and attempts to tap resources there have revived tensions between Turkey and Greece, which has a defense protection pact with the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government.
Turkey and Cyprus have overlapping claims of marine jurisdiction and both plan to carry out exploratory drills this year. Ankara only has diplomatic relations with a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the island that is not recognized by other countries. 
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the delivery of a naval corvette and submarine, Erdogan said countries that thought they could operate in the east Mediterranean or Aegean seas without Ankara's agreement were mistaken.
""We will not accept attempts to extract natural resources in our country, Cyprus or in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Erdogan said.
Last month Turkey complained that a Greek frigate had harassed a Turkish exploration ship west of Cyprus. Greece denied the charge and Cyprus accused Turkey of stirring up tensions.
Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Ankara, says any offshore wealth also belongs to its citizens, as partners in the establishment of the Cyprus republic in 1960.

The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.

ADEN (Reuters) - Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition inched closer to the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah on Sunday as they battled Iranian-aligned Houthi fighters entrenched there, local military sources and residents said on Sunday.
The coalition has deployed thousands of troops to retake Hodeidah, a vital entry point for imports and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis after more than three years of war.
Fighting was focused around the airport, which the coalition failed to seize in a previous offensive, and also at the eastern entrance to the city and near a university that lies 4 km south of the port, which handles most of Yemen's imports. 
""This is the first time clashes have reached this point (the university),"" one pro-coalition Yemeni military source said.
Residents said they could hear exchanges of fire in the area.
The alliance, which relies on Western arms and intelligence, faces a challenge to seize the heavily-defended city without causing heavy casualties at time of increasing global scrutiny over the war that has killed more than 10,000 people.
The United States and Britain have called for an end to the conflict, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. [nnL8N1XB3YF]
U.N. refugee agency UNHCR special envoy Angelina Jolie said the international community had been ""shamefully slow"" and urged the U.N. Security Council to find a negotiated end to the war.
""We have watched the situation deteriorate to the point that Yemen is now on the brink of man-made famine, and facing the worst cholera epidemic in the world in decades,"" the U.S. actress said in a statement on Sunday.
Her statement repeated a U.N. warning that half the population of Yemen -- some 14 million people -- could soon be on the brink of famine.
The alliance of Sunni Muslim states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to oust the Houthis and restore the internationally recognized government. The conflict is seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran. 
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi say wresting control of Hodeidah would deliver a blow to the Houthis, who still control the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, by cutting their main supply line and force them to the negotiating table.
A previous attempt to take the city in June ran into difficulties and was halted ahead of U.N.-led peace consultations in Geneva which collapsed in September after the Houthis failed to show up.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths said last week he hoped consultations could restart within a month. He is preparing to visit Taiz, Yemen's third largest city and a flashpoint since the Houthis drove the government out of Sanaa in 2014, according to sources close to the U.N. talks.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Activists called for U.N. member states to pressure China this week to account for alleged human rights violations, including the suspected mass detention of one million Muslim Uighurs in far-western Xinjiang province.
China's record will be examined by the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday, the first time since 2013, in a regular review expected to focus on its treatment of ethnic minorities, especially Uighurs and Tibetans.
China says Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists. It rejects all accusations of mistreatment in an area where hundreds have been killed in unrest between Uighurs and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
While denying the allegations of arbitrary detentions and political re-education across a network of secret camps, however, officials have recently said some citizens guilty of minor offences were being sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities.
Activists sharply criticized Beijing's rights record.
""In the last five years, generally the human rights situation in China has been getting worse, particularly in east Turkestan (Xinjiang) and Tibet, there has been an unimaginable deterioration,"" said Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uighur Congress.""That's why we expect that the countries should be speaking loudly and strongly,"" he told Reuters in an interview at an activist forum on China held in Geneva on Friday.
Xinjiang has become a ""police state"" where his mother died in a ""concentration camp"" in May, Isa said, adding: ""We have never heard of people coming out from the camps.""
Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, told Reuters at the event: ""The detention of over a million ethnic Uighurs is a tipping point for the international community. They really can't look the other way now...""
Le Yucheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, will lead China's delegation to the session.
""UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE"" 
""The Human Rights Council must send an unequivocal message to the Chinese government that their campaign of systematic repression in the XUAR (Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region), including the arbitrary detention of up to one million people, must end,"" Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement.
Lobsang Sangay, head of the Tibetan government in exile, took a swipe at Chinese President Xi Jinping's mantra of ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"".
""Socialism with Chinese characteristics means no democracy, one party dictatorship and essentially no human rights,"" Sangay said in a keynote speech at the Geneva event.
""If the U.N. Human Rights Council cannot make China accountable for human rights violations, then who will?""Golog Jigme, a Tibetan monk dressed in crimson robes, gave testimony about three jail terms he served before escaping and gaining political asylum in Switzerland in 2015.
""I still have scars on my hands and feet from torture sustained in prison,"" he told the forum.
""Please review the human rights situation in China carefully, critically. If the UN fails to make China accountable this time, it failed all humanity.""

China denies accusations of human rights abuses in Tibet.

YANGON (Reuters) - Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) expects to have won only seven of 13 seats up for grabs in by-elections, a spokesman said on Sunday, conceding that Myanmar's ruling party needed to do more for voters from ethnic minorities. 
The polls, held on Saturday, will not alter the balance of power but were seen as an early test ahead of a general election in 2020.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi promised to make ending the country's decades-old ethnic conflicts her government's top priority, but peace talks have stalled and fighting has intensified.
""We lost five out of six seats in ethnic areas. Ethnic people are not satisfied with our performance on the peace process,"" said NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt, sharing the party's understanding of the results ahead of an official announcement by the election commission.
""This result is a lesson for us. We will come up with a strategy for each constituency for the coming election.""
Suu Kyi has led Myanmar's civilian administration since winning a majority in both houses of parliament in 2015 elections that ended decades of military rule.
But she must share power with the army, which automatically takes 25 percent of parliamentary seats under a military-drafted constitution.
Saturday's polls included seats in state and regional legislatures, as well the national parliament in the capital, Naypyitaw.
The NLD won most of Saturday's contests in the central heartland where ethnic Bamar Buddhists make up the majority.
In the northern state of Kachin, the NLD finished third in an Upper House race it had won in 2015. 
On Saturday, the seat in state capital Myitkyina went to the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, with several formerly separate ethnic Kachin parties throwing their support behind the Kachin Development Party (KDP), which finished second.
Gumgrawng Awng Hkam, the KDP candidate, told Reuters he was concerned that a large number of advance votes from a military cantonment in the city appeared to have swung the result in favor of his military-backed opponent.
A group of monitors led by the People's Alliance for Credible Elections said on Sunday that election authorities in Myitkyina accepted advance votes that arrived at a polling center after a 4 p.m. cut-off time for voting. Late votes were not accepted elsewhere, they said.
""Generally, election day was smooth, and no big incidents have been reported,"" the monitors said in a statement.
Eleven of the seats contested on Saturday fell vacant when legislators died in office, a reflection of Myanmar's aging political leadership. 

One seat, for Yangon's Tamwe township, fell vacant when the previous MP, Win Myint, became president. The NLD won the seat comfortably on Saturday.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron faces a week of historic commemoration and intense diplomacy as he prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One and host more than 60 world leaders at a peace gathering in Paris.
U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and scores of other heads of state and government are expected in Paris for the culminating ceremony on Nov. 11, the actual centenary, and the opening of the Paris Peace Forum, an initiative to improve international cooperation and governance.
After a four-day break from work - which prompted the Elysee to deny the 40-year-old president was suffering from exhaustion - Macron will spend a week visiting the former battlefields of northern and eastern France to honor the dead of the Great War, when 1.4 million French soldiers perished.
He begins the commemoration in Strasbourg, on the Franco-German border, on Sunday with an evening ceremony at the city's cathedral with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
Much of the grinding four years of war was fought on French and Belgian soil; the mounds of trench lines still scar the land along the frontiers of eastern France and its borders with Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium. 
On Friday Macron will lay wreaths with British Prime Minister Theresa May in the town of Albert to honor British soldiers who died at the Battle of the Somme. On Saturday he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold a joint ceremony at the train carriage where the armistice was signed in 1918.
While he was born more than 30 years after World War Two, Macron has been quick to draw links to the past to underscore his awareness of the historical weight of the conflicts that tore Europe apart. He often cites the fact that he grew up in Amiens, a city deeply stricken by both wars.
""I was born in what we call in French La Somme,"" he told relatives of veterans during a visit to Australia earlier this year. ""I grew up with all these thousands of stories, memories and traces of what France owes"" its allies, he said.
The series of commemorations culminates on Sunday Nov. 11 when services are held in France and Britain, including a minute's silence at 11 a.m., the time the armistice was signed.
Trump and Putin will hold talks while in Paris, with the Russian leader seeking to discuss U.S. plans to leave a 1987 nuclear missile treaty, among other issues. 
The question will be whether it is Macron who manages to bring them together, or Trump who may try to claim credit.
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will also be in Paris for the centenary. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is only sending his premier Rami Hamdallah, scotching talk that the Peace Forum could bring the first substantive meeting beteeen Israeli and Palestinian leaders since 2015.

A deal to end the 70-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains elusive, and wars and insurgencies continue to plague larges swathes of the Middle East.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>","Indonesia extends search for jet crash victims, second black box","By Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities on Sunday extended by three days the search for victims and a black box from the wreckage of a Lion Air passenger jet that crashed near Jakarta last week, killing all 189 people on board.
""We decided to extend it three days"", beginning on Monday, search and rescue agency (Basarnas) chief Muhammad Syaugi told a news conference.
The decision was based on an evaluation and observations of the crash site, he told reporters, noting that many victims' remains had not been recovered.
As of Sunday a total of 105 body bags, few containing intact remains, had been recovered and handed to police for forensic identification, yet only 14 victims had been identified.
""I'm sure the total will increase,"" Syaugi said.
The agency is prioritizing recovering remains of victims and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the second of two black boxes from the  Boeing Co . (N:BA) 737 MAX that crashed into the sea early on Monday, 13 minutes after it took off from Jakarta.
The head of Indonesia's transportation safety committee (KNKT) said 69 hours of recorded data from 19 flights, including the one that crashed, had been downloaded successfully from a partly damaged flight data recorder recovered on Thursday.
""Now we are choosing which parameters we need. From here we will analyze what happened to that flight,"" Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters. Analysis of the data and a recovered aircraft landing gear and engine will begin on Monday and information will be passed to police if needed, Utomo said.
""Of course, this won't be completed in one or two days."" 
Meanwhile, divers searching for the cockpit voice recorder have been homing in on ping signals. 
""Yesterday there was a fairly strong signal. Today (a search) dive was conducted -- there was a signal but it was weak, quite possibly because of the mud,"" Utomo said.
He noted that the flight data recorder had been found buried in half a meter of mud.
The second black box is thought to be around 50 meters from the main search area, where the water is only 30 m (98 ft) deep, but ocean currents and mud on the sea bed that is over a meter deep have complicated search efforts.
The pilot of flight JT610 had asked for, and received, permission to turn back to Jakarta, but what went wrong remains a mystery.
While victims' relatives are desperate to know what happened, the first crash of a Boeing 737 MAX is also the focus of scrutiny by the global aviation industry. Preliminary findings of the investigation are expected to be made public after 30 days.
Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets but its safety record has been patchy. Its transport safety panel investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.

""There's still a lot we need to improve,"" Air Transportation Director General Pramintohadi Sukarno said at a press conference on Saturday, referring to safety rules.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party jumped ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's LREM for the first time in a poll of voting intentions for May 2019 European Parliament elections.
An Ifop poll published on Sunday showed the centrist Republic on the Move (LREM) with 19 percent of voting intentions compared to 20 percent at the end of August, while far-right leader Marine Le Pen's RN -- formerly the National Front -- rose to 21 percent from 17 percent previously.
Together with the seven percent score of sovereignist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan and one percent each for ""Frexit"" parties led by former Le Pen associate Florian Philippot and Francois Asselineau, far-right parties won a combined 30 percent of voting intentions, up from 25 percent end August. 
The poll asked nearly 1,000 French people on Oct 30-31 who they would vote for if the European Parliament elections were to be held the next Sunday. 
The conservative Les Republicains party led by Laurent Wauquiez slipped two percentage points to 13 percent, while the far-left France Insoumise led by Jean-Luc Melenchon fell from 14 to 11 percent. 
Melenchon was widely criticised and mocked after yelling at police officers during a raid of his party offices as part of an anti-corruption inquiry. [nL8N1WX36P]
In an Odoxa-Dentsu poll released mid-September, Macron and Le Pen's parties were neck-and-neck at around 21 percent, while the conservative Les Republicains came third with 14 percent and Melenchon's France Insoumise fourth with 12.5 percent.
In an Ifop poll in May, the LREM was seen winning 27 percent of the EU parliament vote, well ahead of the far right's 17 percent and more than Macron's 24 percent in the first round of France's April 2017 presidential elections.
The European elections are shaping up to be a major battle between centrist, pro-EU parties like Macron's LREM and far-right formations that want to stop immigration and globalisation.
The European Parliament elections determine who leads the major EU institutions, including the European Commission, the bloc's civil service, and are also important as a bellwether of sentiment among the EU's 500 million people.
In a YouGov poll published last week, Macron's popularity fell to its lowest level since his 2017 election, with only 21 percent of those polled saying they were satisfied with him.

Macron's reputation has been hit by the brusque departure of two high-profile ministers and a summer scandal over his bodyguard, while stubbornly high unemployment, high taxes and rising fuel prices add to a general feeling of discontent.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Bahrain court overturns acquittal of opposition leaders,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Bahraini court on Sunday ordered life sentences for three senior opposition members, overturning a previous acquittal on charges of spying for Qatar in what an international rights group called a ""travesty of justice"".
A public prosecutor statement said the court sentenced Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary-general of the opposition al-Wefaq group, and Sheikh Hassan Sultan and Ali Alaswad, members of the same group, to life in jail for transferring confidential information and receiving financial support from Qatar.
Bahrain’s public prosecutor had appealed a court ruling that acquitted the three senior leaders last June in a rare win for opposition figures who say they have been targeted by prosecutors for their political views.
Sultan and Alaswad were tried in absentia. Salman is already serving a four-year prison sentence for inciting hatred and insulting the interior ministry, after he was arrested in 2015.
Along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, Bahrain imposed a boycott on Qatar last year, accusing it of supporting terrorism and cosying up to Iran.
Qatar denies the charges, saying they are an attempt to undermine its sovereignty.
Since the Bahrain authorities crushed street protests in 2011, demonstrators have clashed frequently with security forces, who have been targeted by several bomb attacks. Manama says Qatar supports the unrest, accusations denied by Doha.
""This verdict is a travesty of justice that demonstrates the Bahraini authorities’ relentless and unlawful efforts to silence any form of dissent,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. 
""Sheikh Ali Salman is a prisoner of conscience who is being held solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression.""
Alaswad, who has lived in London since 2011, has told Reuters that the public prosecutor used secret witnesses and a video from a Bahraini television channel which experts described as edited and incomplete.
Courts in Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet is based, last year dissolved al-Wefaq and National Democratic Action Society (Waad), accusing them of helping to foster violence and terrorism.
Bahrain has barred members of dissolved opposition groups from running in parliamentary elections due to be held later this month.

Wefaq, which has strong links to the country’s Shi’ite Muslim majority, and Waad, which is seen as a secular movement, have both campaigned for social and political reforms in the country, which is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The husband of a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted after spending eight years on death row on charges of blasphemy has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump for refuge, citing danger to family members' lives. 
Ashiq Masih, the husband of Asia Bibi, whose case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, also appealed to the United Kingdom and Canada for assistance. 
The ultra-right Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party blocked major roads in Pakistan's biggest cities for three days, calling for the murder of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi on Wednesday, and terming Prime Minister Imran Khan and the country's army chief enemies of Islam. 
The TLP called off the protests late on Friday after striking a deal with the government that could see authorities seek to put Bibi on an 'exit control list' barring her from leaving the country and open a review of the verdict in the courts.
""I am requesting the President of the United States Donald Trump to help us exit from Pakistan,"" Masih said in a video recorded by the British Pakistani Christian Association and seen by Reuters. 
""I also request the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to help us, I also request the Prime Minister of Canada,"" he said, while also asking for help on behalf of his brother Jospeh Nadeem who has assisted with Bibi's case.
The U.S. Embassy and British and Canadian High Commissions in Islamabad did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the video. 
On Saturday, Bibi's lawyer Saiful Mulook told Reuters he had left Pakistan ""to save (my) life from angry mob"" and because of fears for the safety of his family.
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She always denied having committed blasphemy.
Her case caught the attention of then Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer who spoke in Bibi's defense before being assassinated by his bodyguard in 2011. The TLP was founded out of a movement to support Taseer's assassin, who was hanged in 2016. 
Federal minister for minorities Shahbaz Bhatti was also killed after calling for her release.
Bibi's whereabouts are unknown, but the TLP has warned the authorities against taking her out of the country.
""There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,"" TLP leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi said after the deal with the government was reached.
Islamist parties have characterized Bibi's release as Pakistan's government caving into Western demands.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's deposed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the United States and Japan had frozen more than a billion dollars of development aid after his abrupt dismissal raised doubts about the future of democracy in the island. 
The move to hold back project financing, along with the EU's warning it could withdraw duty-free concessions for Sri Lankan exports if it didn't stick to commitments on national reconciliation, will further strain the economy, Wickremesinghe told Reuters in an interview.
President Maithripala Sirisena fired him last month after months of tensions within the government and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as premier in a shock move that has plunged the nation into a political crisis. 
Rajapaksa is a former president who led the country to a military defeat of Tamil separatist guerrillas in 2009 but who has since faced widespread allegations of human rights abuse and targeting of Tamil civilians.
Wickremesinghe, who has challenged his dismissal and vowed to remain prime minister until parliament voted him out, said there were international concerns about a government led by Rajapaksa. 
""Countries are sensitive, they have concerns (about a government led by Rajapaksa) democratic countries have concerns,"" he said in the interview conducted in the prime minister's official residence in a colonial-era bungalow where Wickremesinghe is camping along with his supporters.
The United States has held off on a nearly $500 million aid program for building of highways and improving land administration by the government-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Wickremesinghe said.
Japan had also put on hold plans to extend a soft loan of $1.4 billion for a light railway project, he said. ""A lot of projects are held up, the Millennium Challenge, the Japanese loan,"" he said. 
The Sri Lankan embassy in Washington has been informally told by the MCC that around $480 million will be on hold because of the latest situation in the country, a Sri Lankan foreign ministry official separately confirmed to Reuters.
An official at the Sri Lankan ministry of Megapolis and Western Development also confirmed the freeze to Reuters on the Japanese loan, imperiling the project.
An official at the Japan International Cooperation Agency said the agency was closely monitoring political developments and the railway project loan had been withheld.
The U.S. embassy in Colombo had no immediate comment when asked if Washington is taking any measures due to the Sri Lankan political crisis. 
The United States and the EU have urged the president to immediately summon parliament and let deputies decide who is to lead the country. Sirisena suspended parliament until Nov. 16 and has made no public statement on his plans.
While Wickremesinghe is staying on in the premier's residence called Temple Trees, Rajapaksa has taken over the offices of the prime minister following his swearing in. 
Wickremesinghe said his party will step up a public campaign for parliament to be called and he be allowed to prove his majority. ""We are all contemplating alternative actions, this includes a big mobilization of people. Ultimately this has to be decided in parliament.""

Soon after taking over Rajapaksa said he wanted to end the ""politics of hate"" in the country and that his government will work for justice for all citizens.

It is the first auto-determination vote to be held in a French territory since Djibouti in the Horn of Africa voted for independence in 1977. Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris.
Voters have been asked the question ""Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?""
A ""yes"" vote would not only dent the pride of France, once a colonial power whose reach spanned the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific Ocean, it would deprive Paris of a foothold in the Indo-Pacific region where China is expanding its presence.
Footage on Australian television showed people queuing in front of polling stations, with the turnout reaching nearly 42 percent by midday, according to the office of the High Commissioner in Noumea, the capital.
Some 175,000 out of the 280,000 people living on the archipelago are eligible to vote, with polls showing earlier in the week that the islands are expected to vote to remain a French territory.
Posters calling for a ""no"" vote said that ""France is the only chance"" while the proponents of independence called in their posters to vote for ""a multicultural, in solidarity, peaceful nation"".
During a visit to the archipelago in May, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the ""pains of colonization"" and saluted the ""dignified"" campaign for autonomy led by the Kanaks. He and his administration have sought to strike a neutral tone on the vote.
New Caledonia's economy is underpinned by French annual subsidies of some 1.3 billion euros ($1.48 billion), nickel deposits that are estimated to represent 25 percent of the world's total and tourism.
It enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defense and education.
First discovered by the British explorer James Cook, the New Caledonia archipelago lies more than 16,700 kms (10,377 miles) from France. It became a French colony in 1853.
Under colonial rule the Kanaks were confined to reserves and excluded from much of the island's economy. The first revolt erupted in 1878, not long after the discovery of large nickel deposits that are today exploited by French miner Eramet's subsidiary SLN.
More than 100 years later, in the mid-1980s, fighting broke out between supporters of independence and those who wanted to remain French, amid festering anger over poverty and poor job opportunities.
A 1988 massacre in a cave on the island of Ouvea left 19 indigenous separatists and two French soldiers dead and intensified talks on the island's future. A 1998 deal provided for a referendum on independence to be held by the end of 2018.
Under the terms of the deal, in the event of a no vote two further referenda can be held before 2022.

(Reuters) - A gunman who killed two women at a Florida yoga studio and wounded five other people before taking his own life had previously been accused of harassing young women, police said on Saturday.
Authorities said they do not know why Scott Beierle, 40, opened fire on Friday afternoon after posing as a customer to join the class at the Hot Yoga studio in Tallahassee. Detectives are searching for links between him and the victims.
The two women who died were identified as a student and a faculty member from Florida State University.
Police said Beierle was a graduate of FSU who served in the military, and that he had been the subject of calls to authorities in the Tallahassee area ""related to harassment of young women.""
In a statement, police said Beierle was staying in a local hotel at the time of the attack, and that investigators were also searching his home in Deltona, Florida, more than 200 miles (322 km) southeast of Tallahassee.
Police records showed he was arrested in 2012 and 2016 on charges of grabbing women's buttocks. Both cases were dismissed, the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported.
An attorney who previously represented Beierle could not be reached for comment.
Two women who were wounded in the shooting remained hospitalized in stable condition on Saturday, police said. Two other shooting victims and a man who was pistol-whipped by Beierle were treated and released.
""There were indications that several people not only fought back but tried to save other people,"" Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said at a news conference.
DOCTOR AND STUDENT
One of the women killed was identified as Nancy Van Vessem, 61, a doctor specializing in internal medicine who was a member of the faculty at Florida State University College of Medicine in Tallahassee.
The other was named as Maura Binkley, a 21-year-old student at FSU. 
Their deaths were ""just devastating to the FSU family,"" said the university's president, John Thrasher.
Van Vessem also worked as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, which described her in a statement as a ""guiding, visionary force"" and ""one of the most respected, inspiring, and accomplished medical professionals in the state and country.""
Binkley had attended Dunwoody High School in suburban Atlanta, Georgia, and was a senior at FSU with an English and German double major. 
The U.S. Army said Beierle had been a second lieutenant and served as a field artilleryman. He was on active duty from 2008 to 2010.
Beierle posted several YouTube videos in 2014 in which he expressed racist and misogynist views and identified with ""involuntary celibates"" or ""incels,"" a loose social media movement of men who blame women for their celibacy, Buzzfeed News reported. In April, a 25-year-old Canadian who said he was a soldier in an ""incel"" rebellion used a rented van to kill 10 people in Toronto.
Friday's bloodshed prompted Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is also Florida's Democratic candidate for governor, to halt his campaign temporarily.
Ahead of Tuesday's election, the city's murder rate has been an issue in the governor's race, with Gillum's opponent, Republican former U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, accusing him of being weak on crime.
Gillum said on Twitter that no act of gun violence was acceptable. DeSantis said the shooting was heartbreaking.
Dozens of yoga practitioners gathered on Saturday morning for an open-air session in front of the State Capitol. Called ""Yoga For A Cause"", the event was in support of people affected by Hurricane Michael. 

The Tallahassee Police Department posted a photo of the gathering on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with the quote ""It holds so much meaning"" and the hashtags #TallyStrong and #OurCityOurHome.

The U.S. embassy in Baghdad had posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday saying Tehran must ""respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration"" of Shi'ite militias.
It was one of several statements issued on the embassy's Twitter account outlining U.S. demands before new U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sector take effect on Nov. 4. The sanctions worry Iraq as it imports crucial supplies from Iran.
Iraq's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it ""rejects interference in Iraq's internal affairs, especially domestic security reform"" and demanded the Twitter post be removed.
Washington and Tehran have competed for influence in Iraq since the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
Iraq's Shi'ite militias, which took part in a U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State, were formally included in the security forces this year. Some militias are backed by Iran, a majority Shi'ite nation. Washington wants them disarmed.
The United States has said it would grant Baghdad a waiver on Iranian gas and energy imports that feed Iraqi power stations and vital food items, Iraqi officials said on Friday.

""The first convoys have entered the camp,"" said Abu Abdullah, a member of the civilian council that runs the camp and has coordinated with the U.N. on humanitarian aid convoys. 
The United Nations said it was delivering food, sanitation and hygiene supplies, nutrition and health assistance to 50,000 people in Rukban, an area under rebel control, in an operation expected to take three to four days. 
The Syrian Arab Red Crescent is also taking part in the convoy, which will also involve an emergency vaccination campaign for 10,000 children against measles, polio and other diseases, a U.N. statement said. 
""While this much-needed delivery is an important achievement, a longer-term solution must be found for the many civilians living in Rukban,"" said Ali al-Za'tari, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Syria. 
The U.S. State Department welcomed the news.
""We also recognize Russia's role in persuading the regime to finally comply with the UN Security Council’s authorizations for the delivery of cross-line humanitarian aid by issuing the administrative approvals required for this convoy to move,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
""We hope to see Russia use its influence with the regime to address the continued lack of humanitarian access across much of Syria,"" she added.
More than half a million people have died in the Syrian conflict since it began in 2011, and half the pre-war population have fled their homes, including more than 5 million who have gone abroad. 
Rukban, located close to the Tanf U.S. military base in the desert near where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq converge, is home to more than 50,000 people whose last U.N. aid convoy arrived in January.
The camp was last month besieged on the Syrian side of the border by the Syrian army, preventing smugglers and traders from delivering food.
Though a U.S.-backed rebel group controls the area, it abuts Jordan's border and is encircled by the Syrian army.
Jordan has put a block on aid crossing the frontier after allowing the January delivery through its territory, and says it should not be held responsible for conditions in the camp. 
U.N. relief trucks had planned to deliver aid to Rukban a week ago after gaining clearance from Damascus, but were delayed for logistical and security reasons, the United Nations said. 
Shortages of food and medicine at the camp have caused at least a dozen deaths in recent weeks; the United Nations described conditions there as ""concerning"" and said thousands of lives were at risk. 
Since Russia entered Syria's war in support of President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, Assad has recovered large swathes of ground. Islamic State insurgents, who once controlled much of Syria, have lost almost all their territory. Front lines between the remaining contested areas appear to have stabilized for now. 
However, many refugees and internally displaced people fear to return home because of poor living conditions, conscription into the military or worry over reprisals.

A spokeswoman said 17 deaths related to the severe weather had been reported to the Agency so far.
Many of the victims to date have been killed by falling trees. Coldiretti, the association of Italian agricultural companies, said in a statement that gales had destroyed around 14 million trees, many in the far north.
Areas from the far northeast to Sicily in the southwest have been affected by the storms, with the worst damage in the northern regions of Trentino and Veneto - the region around Venice - where villages and roads have been cut off by landslides.
In the Alps near Belluno, 100 km (60 miles) north of Venice, pine trees and red spruces were snapped wholesale like matchsticks.
The surface of the Comelico Superiore dam, farther north near the Austrian border, was covered with the trunks of trees that had fallen into the Piave river. 
""We'll need at least a century to return to normality,"" Coldiretti said.
Many of the squares and walkways of Venice itself have been submerged in the highest floods the canal city has seen in a decade.

Erdogan gave few details but his comments come amid indications that Washington and Ankara are trying to mend relations which plunged into crisis this year, and he welcomed what he said was the start of negotiations over the bank.
Turkey's state-owned Halkbank has been one of the main points of disagreement between the two NATO allies, who are also at odds over policy in Syria and Turkey's purchase of a Russian missile defense system. 
A U.S. court in May jailed a Halkbank executive for helping Tehran get round U.S. sanctions. The U.S. Treasury is also considering a fine against the bank.
Halkbank denies any wrongdoing and Erdogan has condemned the court case as a political attack on his government. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told Reuters in September he did not expect the bank to face a fine.
The Turkish president said he and Trump discussed Halkbank in a call on Thursday and the U.S. president told him ""he would instruct the relevant ministers immediately"", without specifying what the president had promised to do. He said U.S. officials called Turkey's Treasury and Finance Minister the next day.
""Talks are underway about this issue. It is very important that this process has begun,"" Erdogan told a news conference in Istanbul. 
Last month a Turkish court freed a U.S. evangelical pastor who had been in jail and under house arrest for two years while he faced trial on terrorism charges. 
On Thursday, after weeks of delay, the two countries started joint patrols near the northern Syrian town of Manbij under an agreement aimed at avoiding direct confrontation. U.S. troops are supporting Kurdish YPG forces in northern Syria, while Turkey has promised to drive the YPG from its southern border. 

Erdogan said he would meet Trump next week in France, where the two leaders are due to attend ceremonies marking the centenary of the end of World War One.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani lawyer who helped a Christian woman overturn her death sentence for blasphemy said on Saturday he had left the country in fear of his life after her acquittal earlier this week sparked street protests by Islamists.
Leaders of the ultra-Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group blocked main roads in Pakistan's biggest cites for three days, calling for the murder of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi on Wednesday -- urging their cooks and servants to kill them. 
Saiful Mulook had kept a low profile during the years he represented Bibi, a mother-of-five who has been on death row since 2010, due to the highly sensitive nature of the case. Two politicians who had tried to help her have been assassinated.
Mulook told Reuters in a WhatsApp message he had gone abroad ""just to save (my) life from angry mob"" and because of fears for the safety of his family. 
""I consulted and everybody is of this opinion (that I should leave),"" he said, adding that he would return to the country to continue his work on the case if he was given protection by security forces.
The TLP called off the protests late on Friday after striking a deal with the government that would see authorities seek to put Bibi on an 'exit control list' barring her from leaving the country.
Bibi's whereabouts are unknown, but Islamists have warned the authorities against taking her out of the country. 
""There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,"" TLP leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi said after the deal was reached.
Earlier in the week one of Rizvi's deputies called for Pakistan's Chief Justice Saqib Nisar and two other judges who ruled in the case to be murdered.
""Whoever, who has got any access to them, kill them before the evening,"" TLP co-founder Muhammad Afzal Qadri told supporters.
The TLP was founded out of a movement supporting a bodyguard who assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he spoke in Bibi's defense in 2011. Federal minister for minorities Shahbaz Bhatti was also killed after calling for her release.
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She always denied having committed blasphemy.
The case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, where Islamist parties such as the TLP have framed Bibi's release as Pakistan's government caving into Western demands.

Bibi's acquittal is being reviewed, though it is extremely rare for a review to overturn a Supreme Court ruling.

The attack is the latest in a series of ""green-on-blue"" attacks in which members of the Afghan forces have killed U.S. or coalition advisers this year and follows the death of a Czech soldier in the western province of Herat last month
""Initial reports indicate the attacker was a member of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Initial reports also indicate the attacker was immediately killed by other Afghan Forces,"" the NATO-led mission said in a statement.
It said the incident was being investigated and the wounded service member was in a stable condition, but did not release the identity of the service member who had been killed. 
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in September that training and vetting of Afghan forces was being stepped up to minimize insider attacks and some training and advisory operations have been scaled back while security is assessed.

Last month, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller, escaped unhurt when the bodyguard of a provincial governor opened fire on a group of U.S. and Afghan officials in the southern province of Kandahar.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A week of fighting between Taliban militants and fighters loyal to a commander from the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority has heightened fears of a dangerous new phase of sectarian violence in Afghanistan.
The clashes in the central province of Uruzgan, which have killed at least 21 people, have highlighted concerns that Hazaras, members of a mainly Shi'ite Persian-speaking minority targeted by Islamic State attacks over recent years, may take up arms in frustration at a lack of action by the government.
While the Taliban, made up mainly of ethnic Pashtun Sunni Muslims, has not explicitly targeted Hazaras in the past, officials fear the violence could escalate into an ethnic battle. 
""The fighting is very intense and is now becoming an issue of ethnic violence between Hazara and Pashtun,"" said Amir Mohammad Barekzai, the provincial council chief. ""The government must arrange a truce between them or there will be a massacre.""
Sectarian violence had until recent years been relatively uncommon in Afghanistan but suicide bombings at Shi'ite mosques and cultural centers by Islamic State as well as attacks on Hazaras traveling on provincial highways have fueled growing anger. Many Hazaras blame Sunni Pashtuns for the attacks.
Afghan and Western security officials, fearing the kind of sectarian violence that has devastated Iraq, have been deeply concerned that Hazaras who fought in Iranian-backed militias in Syria could hit Sunni targets.
TAX ROW SPARKS VIOLENCE
The recent violence started when Taliban fighters attacked a remote cluster of Hazara villages in Uruzgan province after they refused to pay tax to the insurgents, provincial officials said.
The Hazara commander, Abdul Hakim Shujaee, a former leader in the U.S.-funded Afghan Local Police, has been accused of serious human rights abuses and faces an arrest order from the central government, which has struggled to impose its authority on remote parts of the country.
He commands hundreds of Hazara fighters and remains free because of his connections with powerful political figures in Kabul, local officials say.
Uruzgan, squeezed between the Taliban heartlands of Kandahar and Helmand and the Hazara-dominated province of Daikondi, is home to both Pashtuns and Hazara families and the two groups have long had an uneasy co-existence.
Asadullah Sayed, the governor of Uruzgan, said fighting broke out between two armed groups in three villages of Khas Uruzgan district last week and government forces have been deployed to end the conflict.
He put the number of dead at 21 but a government security official said 43 people had been killed so far on both sides, many more wounded and some 300 families have fled the area.
The Taliban normally collect taxes from local residents in areas under their control to fund their insurgency but Hazara families defied them, setting off a fierce gun battle, he said.
The case echoes a standoff last month in central Ghor province involving a prominent Hazara commander called Alipur, known as ""Commander Sword"", seen by supporters as a kind of Robin Hood figure but denounced by the government as a bandit.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's top leader said on Saturday U.S. President Donald Trump's policies face opposition across the world as Washington prepared to reimpose sanctions on Iran's vital oil-exporting and financial sectors, state television reported.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also said Iran's arch-adversary the United States had failed to reassert its domination over Iran since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah.
""The world opposes every decision made by Trump,"" Iranian state television quoted Khamenei, a Shi'ite cleric with ultimate authority in Iran, as saying during a meeting with thousands of students. 
""America's goal has been to re-establish the domination it had (before 1979) but it has failed. America has been defeated by the Islamic Republic over the past 40 years."" 
Washington will on Monday reintroduce far-reaching sanctions on Iran's vital oil sales and banking sectors to try to force the Islamic Republic into negotiations to scrap its nuclear energy and ballistic missile programs and end its support for proxies in conflicts across the Middle East.
However, the Trump administration said on Friday that eight importing countries would temporarily be allowed to keep buying Iranian oil when sanctions come back into effect. Iran is the world's No. 3 oil exporter. 
Turkey said on Saturday that Ankara had received initial indications from Washington that it would be granted a waiver, but is awaiting clarification on Monday.
Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said his country and other leading oil importers would benefit from the U.S. waivers.
Most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in early 2016 under a deal Iran signed with world powers the year before under which it curbed its uranium enrichment program, widely seen abroad as a disguised effort to develop an atomic bomb.
But Trump denounced the nuclear deal, approved by his predecessor Barack Obama, as flawed in Iran's favor and withdrew Washington from the pact in May. Trump's decision was welcomed by Washington’s Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab allies, involved in proxy conflict with Shi'ite Iran for decades.
The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Saturday that Iran's ""aggressive policies"" were ""largely responsible"" for the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif spoke by telephone with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and his counterparts from Germany, Sweden and Denmark about pending European measures to counter the U.S. sanctions, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported.
GAME OF THRONES
General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force that oversees its operations abroad, responded to Trump's Game of Thrones-inspired tweet on Friday that warned, ""Sanctions are Coming."" 
""I will stand against you,"" Soleimani said on Instagram, posting a similarly themed photo and repeating remarks made in July. 
The EU, France, Germany and Britain - all co-signatories, along with Russia and China, to the nuclear deal with Iran -
said in a joint statement on Friday they regretted Trump's decision to restore sanctions on Iran.
Diplomats told Reuters last week that the new EU mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4 but not operational until early next year. They cautioned, however, that no country had volunteered to host the entity, which was delaying the process.
A senior French diplomat said on Saturday there was no way any trade with this mechanism could be conducted before the end of 2018. For now no other countries, including China, would be part of it although that could change over time. 
The other parties to the nuclear deal see it as an important bulwark against the risk of wider war in the Middle East and have reaffirmed their commitment to it. Iran has said it could leave the pact if the EU cannot protect its economic benefits. 
With the sanctions clampdown, Trump is seeking to push Iran to end uranium enrichment outright, and halt its ballistic missile development and support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.

""Iran ... will not permit the Trump regime, which has made American foreign policy devoid of any principles, to reach its illegitimate goals,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by IRNA.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The funeral of Thai billionaire and Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, killed in a helicopter crash a week ago, got underway at a Bangkok temple on Saturday with a Buddhist bathing rite using water bestowed by the Thai King.
Vichai, 60, founder of Thai duty-free giant King Power International, was killed last Saturday along with four others when his helicopter crashed outside the King Power Stadium in the English city of Leicester after a Premier League match.
The funeral, closed to the public and media, was attended by Vichai's relatives, friends and senior Thai politicians and soccer officials.
It began with a bathing ritual using royally-bestowed water and an eight-sided urn lent as an honor by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and was followed by recitation ceremonies which will last for seven days.
Thailand's kings have traditionally granted such honors at the funerals of high-ranking state officials or citizens who had devoted their lives to the good of the country. 
Outside the temple on Saturday, Kiatisuk ""Zico"" Senamuang, a former Thai national soccer player and coach who was also at the Leicester match, told reporters that international soccer world had lost an important patron. 
""I'm very proud of him... Not only the Thai people but also soccer fans around the world mourn his loss,"" he said.
Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy and his team mates will travel to Thailand for the funeral after Saturday's Premier League match against Cardiff City. 
Vichai, who bought Leicester City in 2010, was adored by fans after the club stunned the soccer world by beating odds of 5,000/1 to win the Premier League title in 2016 in what amounted to a sporting fairy tale. 
The Thai tycoon died along with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger when the helicopter came down in a car park moments after taking off on Oct. 27. His body arrived in Bangkok on Friday.
He had close ties to the Thai royal family, being bestowed with the last name Srivaddhanaprabha - meaning ""glowing light of prosperity"" - as an honor to his family in 2012. 
Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, nicknamed ""Top"", Vichai's youngest child and King Power's chief executive officer, said last week that he has ""received a very big mission and legacy"" from his father.
Vichai's death came just weeks before a planned auction for Thailand's airport duty-free and commercial concessions, threatening to end King Power's near monopoly of the sector. 
King Power currently controls more than 90 percent of Thailand's duty-free market, being a sole operator with concessions in all major airports in the country until 2020.

ABOARD USS RONALD REAGAN (Reuters) - U.S. fighter jets darted over the Western Pacific on Saturday as the nuclear powered USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier joined Japanese destroyers and a Canadian warship for the biggest combat readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan.
Japan and the United States have mobilized 57,000 sailors, marines and airmen for the biennial Keen Sword exercise, 11,000 more than in 2016, with simulated air combat, amphibious landings and ballistic missile defense drills. Japan's contingent of 47,000 personnel represents a fifth of the nation's armed forces. 
""We are here to stabilize, and preserve our capability should it be needed. Exercises like Keen Sword are exactly the kind of thing we need to do,"" Rear Admiral Karl Thomas, the commander of the carrier strike group, said during a press briefing in the Reagan's focsle as F-18 fighter jets catapulted off the flight deck above him. 
Eight other ships joined the carrier for anti-submarine warfare drills in a show of force in waters that Washington and Tokyo fear will increasingly come under Beijing's influence.
""The U.S.-Japan alliance is essential for stability in this region and the wider Indo Pacific,"" Rear Admiral Hiroshi Egawa, the commander of the Japanese ships said aboard the Reagan 
Based in Yokosuka near Tokyo, it is the biggest U.S. warship in Asia, with a crew of 5,000 sailors and around 90 F-18 Super Hornets fighters.
CANADA JOINS 
A Canadian naval supply ship is also taking part in Keen Sword along with the frigate that sailed with the Reagan on Saturday.
Canadian participation is taking a bilateral drill which began in 1986 ""into the realm of multilateral exercises,"" Canada's defense attache in Japan, Captain Hugues Canuel said in Tokyo. Participation in Keen Sword, he added, reflects Canada's desire to have a military presence in Asia.
Canada isn't the only western nation looking to take a bigger security role in the region. Britain and France are also sending more ships as China's military presence in the South China Sea grows and its influence over the Indo Pacific and its key trade routes expands. 
British, French, Australian and South Korean observers will also monitor Keen Sword, which began Monday and ends on Thursday. 
BOLDER JAPAN
Growing foreign interest in Asian security, including North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, coincides with greater Japanese willingness to back up its regional diplomacy with a show of military muscle. 
Tokyo this year sent its biggest warship, the Kaga helicopter carrier, on a two-month tour of the Indo Pacific, including flag-waving stops in the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Singapore. 
The 248 meter (813.65 ft) long Maritime Self Defence Force ship and its two destroyer escorts also conducted drills with a Japanese submarine in the contested South China Sea.
At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has engaged China in dialogue to reduce tension between their militaries in the East China Sea and to increase economic cooperation between Asia's two leading economies. 
Amid a background of trade friction with Washington, Abe last month traveled to Beijing, the first such trip by a Japanese leader in seven years, for talks with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Abe told them that China and Japan shared responsibility for regional security, including tackling North Korean.
Japan, however, still views China as a potentially much larger and more challenging foe than Pyongyang as its expanding navy consolidates control of the South China Sea and ventures deeper into the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. 
Beijing this year plans to spend 1.11 trillion yuan ($160 billion) on its armed forces, more than three times as much as Japan and about a third of what the U.S. pays for a military that helps defend the Japanese islands. 
Keen Sword ""remains an expression of the commitment of like minded allies and partners. To really see what we can do in terms of demonstrating advanced capabilities together to ensure peace and stability in the Indo Pacific,"" Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said on Thursday in Australia during a telephone press briefing.

MINYA, Egypt (Reuters) - Thousands of Christian mourners prepared on Saturday to bury six members of the same family who were killed while returning from a baptism at a Coptic monastery in Egypt's Minya province.
Gunmen opened fire on Friday on two buses near the Monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor in Minya, 260 km (160 miles) up the River Nile from Cairo, killing seven people and wounding another 18, including children.
The attack was claimed by Islamic State which, along with affiliated groups, has said it was responsible for several on Egypt's Christian minority, including one that killed 28 people in almost the same spot in May 2017.
Although Egypt's army and police launched a crackdown on the militant groups in February, some of the Christian mourners blamed security lapses for repeated attacks against them.
Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he mourned the victims as martyrs and vowed to push ahead with the campaign.
""There is a mix of sadness and pain; sadness as these painful events are being repeated and pain because Copts are part of this homeland and part of its fabric,"" Bishop Macarius, head of the Coptic diocese in Minya, told mourners at the Prince Tadros Church in Minya, tears streaming down his face.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian rescue diver died in a search operation for a jet that crashed early this week near Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board, the search and rescue agency (Basarnas) said on Saturday.
Syachrul Anto, 48, died on Friday while diving to search for victims of the crashed Lion Air aircraft, the agency said on Saturday.
""Deepest condolences for the passing of a humanitarian hero from the Indonesian Diving Rescue Team,"" Basarnas chief Muhammad Syaugi said in a news release.
It was not immediately clear how Anto perished. Anto's family had chosen not to conduct an autopsy and asked for his remains to be buried immediately, Basarnas spokesman Yusuf Latif told Reuters by text message.
Among other missions, Anto was also one of the main divers involved in the search for an AirAsia jet that crashed off Borneo in late 2014.
Rescue divers have been crucial in recovering human remains and pieces of the wrecked near-new  Boeing Co . (N:BA) 737 MAX that smashed into the sea early on Monday, 13 minutes after it took off from Jakarta.
As of Saturday a total of 73 body bags, few containing intact remains, had been recovered, but only four of the victims had been identified.
Divers have been searching through debris on the muddy sea bed for a second black box from the jet, as investigators try to get data from a partly damaged recorder recovered on Thursday.
The pilot of flight JT610 had asked for, and received, permission to turn back to Jakarta, but what went wrong remains a mystery.
""The team have been hearing the 'ping' sound from another black box for two days,"" Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of the transportation safety committee (KNKT), told Reuters on Friday.
The sea is only 30 m (98 ft) deep at the crash site but strong currents and nearby pipelines have hampered the search.
Visiting the search operation headquarters at Jakarta's port on Friday, President Joko Widodo thanked rescue officials and the military involved and appealed for them to step up the search.
""I ask for you to use all your might, all the technology available, to work fast to find anything else,"" he said.
While victims' relatives are desperate to know what happened, the investigation of the first crash of a Boeing 737 MAX is also the focus of scrutiny by the global aviation industry. Preliminary investigation findings are expected to be made public after 30 days.
Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets but its safety record has been patchy. Its transport safety panel investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.

""Soon the needed number of this plane will be produced and put at the service of the Air Force,"" Defence Minister Amir Hatami said at a ceremony on Saturday to launch the plane's production, which was shown on television. 
The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it re-imposes sanctions on Monday to try to force Iran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities.
Having abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to cripple Iran's oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East.
Iran says the Kowsar is ""100-percent indigenously made"" and able to carry various weapons and is to be used for short aerial support missions. 
However, some military experts believe the fighter jet is a carbon copy of an F-5 first produced in the United States in the 1960s.
Iran's air force has been limited to perhaps a few dozen strike aircraft using either Russian or ageing U.S. models acquired before the 1979 Iranian revolution.
Tehran has sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to help prop up President Bashar al-Assad's forces, but had to rely on Russia for aerial support due to its own lack of a powerful air force.
The Islamic Republic launched in 2013 what it said was a new, domestically-built fighter jet, called Qaher 313, but some experts expressed doubts about the viability of the aircraft at the time.

Simon Birmingham, the first senior Australian government official to visit China in a year, will attend the China International Import Expo, or CIIE, seen as an attempt by Beijing to allay foreign concern about its trade practices.
Relations between Australia and the world's No.2 economy have been at low ebb over accusations of China's influence in Australia's media, universities and politics and its use of loans to build leverage over poorer South Pacific island nations.
In August, Australia banned Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from supplying equipment for a 5G mobile network citing national security risks, a move the Chinese telecoms gear maker criticized as being ""politically motivated"".
China, however, remains Australia's top goods and services trading partner, accounting for 24 percent, or A$183.4 billion ($132 billion), of total trade in 2017, according to data from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
Birmingham said in a statement on Saturday that Australia's ""high-level"" delegation, which includes representation from state and territory governments, ""reflects our ongoing commitment to our relationship with China"".
The minister's press office said the hope is that Birmingham will meet with his Chinese counterpart, Commerce Minister Zhong Shan while in Shanghai. 
Later in the week, Birmingham will visit Hong Kong where he is expected to meet with Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau, ""to move forward negotiations on the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement"".
Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to open the CIIE with a speech on Monday. No officials from the United States, China's top trading partner, will attend, although leaders from 18 countries and thousands of foreign companies will be present.

Police received a call at 5.37 p.m. of multiple victims at the Hot Yoga studio at an upscale shopping center in Florida's capital, Tallahassee, Police Chief Michael DeLeo told reporters.
The shooter pistol-whipped one man in the yoga class who rushed him after he opened fire, the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported.
""There were indications that several people not only fought back but tried to save other people,"" DeLeo told reporters, confirming that one man was pistol-whipped.
Three of the wounded were in critical condition, said Danielle Buchanan, spokeswoman for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.

Police have tentatively identified the shooter and are looking for any links between him and the victims, he added.
""All evidence points to a single actor who has stayed on scene and is deceased at this time so there is no additional threat to the public,"" DeLeo said. City Commissioner Scott Maddox was among officials who went to the incident.

INDIANAPOLIS/MIAMI (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Friday against rhetoric he said was meant to sow fear as he campaigned in support of Democratic candidates while President Donald Trump hammered a hardline anti-immigration message to energize Republicans.
In a packed day of campaigning ahead of Tuesday's congressional midterm elections, Trump continued a blitz of rallies urging voters to keep his Republican Party in control of Congress, while Democrats appeared to notch a win in their efforts to halt the spread of misinformation online.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it had deleted more than 10,000 automated accounts posting messages that discouraged people from voting in Tuesday’s elections and wrongly appeared to be from Democrats, after the party flagged the misleading tweets to the social media company.
The removals took place in late September and early October.
Obama hit on a common theme of Democratic campaigns - defending his signature 2010 healthcare law, while urging Americans not to embrace hostility and division in politics.
""We have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful,"" Obama said in Miami. ""But in four days, Florida, you can be a check on that kind of behavior.""
Obama was flanked by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman and strong Trump backer Ron DeSantis, and Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott. 
Trump's campaign stops were aimed at bolstering Republicans challenging incumbent Democratic senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.
Speaking on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate, Trump told a rally in Indianapolis:
“If you want prosperity for your family, safety for your children and security for your country, vote for Mike Braun.”
Trump was joined on stage by former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, who led the crowd in a cheer “Go get’em Donald.”
Opinion polls and non-partisan forecasters generally show Democrats with strong chances of winning 23 additional seats and taking a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump's administration and block his legislative agenda.
Republicans are favored to retain control of the Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump's nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.
Obama's speech was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers, prompting him to quip: ""Why is it that the folks who won the last election are so mad all the time?""

SURGING EARLY VOTING
Interest in the election has been unusually high in a year when Congress but not the White House is at stake, according to early voting tallies. Twenty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have recorded more early votes at this point in the campaign than they did in all of 2014, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks turnout.
Texas had already recorded more votes than it did in all of 2014, including Election Day, the group said.
After Miami, Obama was headed to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator aiming to become the nation's first black female governor.
That race pitting Abrams against Republican Brian Kemp, the state's top elections overseer, has become a flashpoint for allegations of voter suppression by Democrats due to the state's strict voter-identification law. Republicans say the law is necessary to deter voter fraud.
A federal judge on Friday ordered the state to allow some 3,000 recently naturalized citizens to vote after their registrations had been put on hold.
With the race neck and neck, voter turnout will be crucial, said Georgia State University political scientist Lakeyta Bonnette-Bailey. Obama could energize Democratic voters and drive up turnout, she added.
""At this point it's going to be turnout,"" she said. ""How can he mobilize those who are already registered to vote to go out and vote. And to tell their friends and families to vote."" 
The final weeks of the campaign have also seen a spate of violence including the massacre of 11 people at a Pennsylvania synagogue and more than a dozen package bombs sent to prominent Trump critics.
The FBI said on Friday it had recovered a suspicious package addressed to California billionaire Tom Steyer, a Democrat known for his ads calling for Trump's impeachment.
In West Virginia, Trump's third visit in three months was aimed at shoring up Patrick Morrisey, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. 
Two new polls this week showed Manchin's once-comfortable lead over Morrisey dwindling to 5 percentage points, which the Democrat's supporters blame in part on Trump's repeated visits.
""I know Trump coming so often is making an impact,"" said Jim Hoyt, chairman of the Morgan County Democratic Party in northeast West Virginia. Like other Democrats in the state, he still expects Manchin to win.

In a statement, USTR said Trump has determined after an annual eligibility review that Mauritania is not in compliance with requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free treatment for certain goods.
""Forced or compulsory labor practices like hereditary slavery have no place in the 21st century,"" Deputy U.S. Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney said.

The rulings are a rebuke to Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose office oversees the voter rolls and who is the Republican candidate in the state's hotly contested gubernatorial race.
The issue of voter suppression has been central to the governor's race in Georgia, where Kemp is facing Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, who is seeking to become the country's first female, black governor.
U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross in Atlanta issued the order to allow some 3,000 recently naturalized U.S. citizens to vote after their registrations were put on hold.
Civil rights groups sued Kemp in October over 50,000 voting registration applications placed on hold due to Georgia's ""exact-match"" law, requiring that personal information on voter applications match what is on state databases. 
Ross' ruling allows the naturalized citizens to vote in Tuesday's midterm election if they present proof of citizenship at the polls.
In the case on absentee ballots, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit rejected Kemp's request to stay a lower court's ruling blocking election officials from throwing out absentee ballots for a supposed signature mismatch, without giving voters an opportunity to contest that and confirm their identity.
""INAPPROPRIATE TO CHANGE"" 
Kemp's spokesman, Candice Broce, called the ruling about naturalized citizens a ""minor change"", while criticizing the decision on absentee ballots.
“Despite this outcome, our concern remains that it is inappropriate to change long-standing procedures this close to an election,"" Broce said in a statement on the decision on absentee ballots. ""Nonetheless, the state and counties will comply with"" the ruling.
Civil rights groups celebrated the ruling on naturalized citizens as a major victory. 
“With respect to Tuesday’s election, we deem this a total victory in our fight against Secretary of State Brian Kemp’s exact-match scheme,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
The ruling on absentee ballots stems from a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and others against Kemp and county registrars. A District Court judge granted the temporary restraining order last week, prompting the state to appeal the decision.

“Once again, a court has blocked Georgia’s attempt to obstruct voters,"" said Sophia Lakin, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. ""This ruling is a huge victory as we round the final turn to the midterms.”

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba on Friday said new sanctions planned by the United States were a futile attempt to change its policies and would only further isolate Washington internationally.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, announced on Thursday that more than two dozen Cuban companies associated with the Communist-run island's military or intelligence would be added to the more than 100 that Americans are already banned from doing business with or patronizing.
The announcement came just an hour after 189 member countries of the United Nations called in a resolution for an end to the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba. Washington tried without success to amend the text to push Cuba to improve its human rights record.
The U.N. vote can carry political weight, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the more than 50-year-old embargo, which Cuba calls a blockade. The United States and Israel voted against the resolution.
Bolton outlined the Trump administration's plans to get tougher on Cuba and its allies Venezuela and Nicaragua in Miami, the heart of the three countries' exile communities, just days before the midterm U.S. congressional elections.
“We energetically reject these measures which will impact the economy and country’s development on top of the impact of the economic blockade,” the director of U.S. affairs at the foreign ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said at a Havana press conference.
“They will fail. They will not break the will of Cubans,” he said.
Trump has taken a harder line on Cuba after former President Barack Obama sought to set aside decades of hostility between Washington and Havana. He has rolled back parts of Obama’s 2014 detente by tightening rules on Americans traveling to the island and restricting U.S. companies from doing business there.
Bolton also said the administration would review whether to allow U.S. citizens whose property was seized by the Cuban government to sue foreign companies that have invested in the properties on the island, a longstanding demand of hard line exiles.
The measure is part of the Helms-Burton Act, which codified all U.S. sanctions against Cuba into law in 1996. It has been waived by various presidents ever since due to opposition from the international community.
Fernandez de Cossio said such a measure would be unprecedented and violate international law, further isolating the United States.

“There is no possibility whatsoever for people who abandoned Cuba and abandoned property in Cuba to come back and claim them,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for a U.S. Treasury Department employee charged with leaking to a journalist confidential documents on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and others, said on Friday that his client was motivated by public service.
Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates have pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to cooperate in U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether President Donald Trump's campaign coordinated with Moscow.
Russia denies election meddling and Trump denies campaign collusion.
Prosecutors said Natalie Sours Edwards, a senior adviser in the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), leaked documents to a reporter that became the basis of articles about that investigation published by digital media company BuzzFeed.
""She saw things in her official capacity that she felt an obligation to bring forward,"" Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Sours Edwards, told reporters after a hearing in federal court in Manhattan.
During Friday's brief hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn ordered that Sours Edwards may remain free on bail. She had previously pleaded not guilty at a hearing in Virginia, according to Agnifilo. She is currently on paid leave from her position.
Prosecutors said beginning in October 2017, Sours Edwards illegally disclosed so-called suspicious activity reports connected to Manafort, accused Russian agent Maria Butina, the Russian embassy and a unit of Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a corporation owned by Russian businessman Denis Katsyv.
Suspicious activity reports are submitted by banks to alert law enforcement to potentially illegal transactions. 
Information from the disclosures was reported in 11 articles that appeared in BuzzFeed over the course of a year, prosecutors said.
Agnifilo said Sours Edwards shared the reports because ""she believes that certain pieces of information were not being handled the right way and were not being brought to the attention of the people who should know it,"" though he did not give further details.
He said Sours Edwards had also spoken to committees in Congress and to other government agencies about her concerns, and that her contact with the media was a relatively small part of her efforts.

""It's been going on for several years,"" he said.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 06:04PM ET</span>",Trump backtracks on suggestion U.S. troops could fire on migrants,"By Makini Brice and Roberta Rampton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday backtracked from his suggestion a day earlier that American troops sent to the U.S. border with Mexico would be free to fire on migrants who throw rocks at them, saying that rock-throwers would only be arrested.
""They won't have to fire. What I don't want is I don't want these people throwing rocks,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House. ""If they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time.""
Trump's rhetoric on shooting migrants drew criticism from human rights groups that said he was stoking fear ahead of next week's congressional elections. Calling migrants a national security threat ""is as absurd as it is cruel,"" advocacy group Human Rights First said in a statement.
In his comments, Trump suggested the military could fire on migrants who cross the border illegally if they throw rocks at troops.
""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. ... I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military police, I say: Consider it a rifle,"" Trump said.
The Nigerian army on Friday used Trump's remarks to justify opening fire at Shi'ite Muslim protesters earlier in the week. Authorities have reported only a few killed but a Shi'ite group said the toll was more than 40.
After Trump's remarks on Thursday saying stone-throwers should be treated as if they were carrying rifles, the Nigerian Army posted a note on Twitter with a video of Trump's remarks, adding: ""Please Watch and Make your Deductions."" 
The U.S. president has hardened his stance on immigration in a bid to rouse his political base ahead of the elections. His Republican party is in an uphill fight to maintain control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, although it is expected to pick up seats in the Senate.
The Pentagon said on Monday it was deploying more than 5,200 troops to the border at Trump's direction to confront a caravan of men, women and children traveling through Mexico as they flee violence and poverty in Central America. Trump has characterized it as an ""invasion"" of migrants.
Mexico has said 2,800 to 3,000 people are in the caravan, which left Honduras in mid-October, although many are expected to drop off before reaching the U.S. border.
Trump also said on Thursday his administration was finalizing a plan to block immigrants who do not come into the United States at a legal port of entry from applying for asylum, although federal law allows any immigrant in the United States to do so.

Still, migrant caravans have pressed on. On Friday, a smaller caravan from El Salvador crossed through a river to enter the Mexico's southern state of Chiapas.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Trump supporters’ election test: a movement or a moment,"By Peter Eisler, Ned Parker and Julia Harte
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (Reuters) - In rally after rally, President Donald Trump exhorts throngs of red-hatted supporters to treat next week’s congressional elections as a referendum on Trumpism and the grass-roots movement that swept him to power.
“You’re voting for me in 2018,” Trump told a raucous crowd in a late September appearance for Republican candidates in Missouri. “You’re voting for me.”
The plea speaks to the challenge facing the president and his supporters: With Democrats threatening to take over the House of Representatives and key governors’ offices, the success of his legislative agenda over the next two years hinges on whether he can energize his backers around candidates who are not named Trump.
This year’s election is the first real test of whether the coalition behind Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan can evolve from a diffuse, personality-driven following to an organized political force able to boost candidates outside his electoral strongholds.
Reuters surveyed officials from 18 Republican campaigns, analyzed data from polling partner Ipsos and interviewed dozens of candidates, strategists and Trump supporters to assess the reach and influence of the president’s self-styled “MAGA Movement” ahead of the elections.
United behind Trump’s “America First” agenda of tighter borders, protectionist economic policies and unilateralist diplomacy, the MAGA coalition swept up 2016 voters who felt ignored by Washington and welcomed Trump’s vows to upend its institutions. Today, it attracts Tea Party conservatives, evangelical Christians, gun rights advocates, and working-class voters drawn to Trump’s outsider persona.
Trump’s populist base is firmly established in the mostly southern and western parts of the country where he’s most popular. MAGA supporters turn out in force for Trump-backed candidates in those areas, boosting them in opinion polls and volunteering for their campaigns. In some cases, they have taken control of state party machines, harnessing their infrastructure and money for candidates in Trump’s mold.
But outside of Trump’s strongholds, the influence of MAGA supporters is more pocketed, especially in Rust Belt states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the upper Midwest. So, while Trump loyalists can tip the scales in specific U.S. House districts in those areas, they have done less to boost Trump-backed candidates in statewide contests for governor and U.S. Senate.
With no central organization and little regard for Republican hierarchies, MAGA enthusiasts agitate largely through social media and Internet forums, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Reddit, the social networking site. In dozens of interviews, Reuters found their willingness to back local campaigns often has less to do with party loyalty than with helping Trump.
“The 2018 elections will be a test of how popular Trump is, how popular his policies are, did we organize well or do we need to do better and improve things for 2020,” said Scott Presler, a MAGA activist in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
Among the 18 Trump-endorsed Republicans running for Senate or governor in states where Trump won the presidential race by more than 10 percentage points in 2016, more than 80 percent are ahead in opinion polls, based on data aggregated by RealClearPolitics and 538.com, non-partisan websites that gather polling from multiple sources. 
Yet among the 16 Trump-backed candidates for Senate or governor in states where he won by fewer than 10 points, just four –  a quarter – are polling ahead.
`LEANING ON THEIR SHOVELS'
The challenge is starkest where Trump-backed candidates are trying to flip governors’ offices and Senate seats held by Democrats, Reuters found.
In states where Trump won by double digits in 2016, two of the five candidates he has endorsed in races for Democrat-held Senate and governors’ seats are leading in the polls, and two others are within a few points. But in states where Trump won by less than 10 points, all six candidates he has endorsed in races for Democratic seats are behind in recent polls, five of them by at least 10 points.
Through much of the campaign season, Trump supporters in many places were “leaning on their shovels,” because they were over-confident of victory, Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and campaign strategist, told Reuters.
MAGA loyalists have grown more energized in recent weeks, realizing Trump’s agenda “would come grinding to a halt” if Democrats capture the U.S. House, Bannon added. “You've seen the establishment and the hardcore anti-establishment in the Trump base all come together.”
The president remains enormously popular with that base - Reuters/Ipsos polling gives him an 84 percent approval rate among Republicans - and more than two-thirds of those who voted for him in 2016 say they identify with MAGA ideals.
Yet their views diverge on what MAGA means: while more than half equate it with strengthening the economy and tightening borders, upwards of a quarter say MAGA simply means “Donald Trump.” (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RuhKTv)
That raises questions about the future of MAGA once Trump leaves office.
A TEST IN TENNESSEE
On Oct. 1, Trump whipped up a crowd of nearly 10,000 at a rally supporting Marsha Blackburn’s U.S. Senate campaign in Tennessee, where Trump won in 2016 by 26 points.
“A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for,” he told the audience.
Soon after, opinion polls showed Blackburn, a U.S. House member, pulling ahead of her Democratic opponent, former two-term governor Phil Bredesen.
“We knew President Trump would be an extraordinary surrogate in East Tennessee,"" Republican Party spokesman Garren Shipley told Reuters.
Bredesen’s campaign dismissed the polls: “The only poll that matters is on election day,” said spokeswoman Alyssa Hansen. 
On Oct. 10, the president held another rally 500 miles (800 km) away with a similar message for Lou Barletta’s U.S. Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, where Trump eked out a one-point victory in 2016. “I need you,” Trump told the crowd. “Vote for Lou!”
It was Trump’s second rally with Barletta since August. But Barletta, also a U.S. House member, trails incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey, and has remained behind by more than 10 points in polls.
The divergent fortunes of Blackburn and Barletta reflect the challenge in harnessing Trump’s MAGA coalition.
Following Trump’s victory in 2016, Tennessee’s Republican establishment embraced his agenda and welcomed his supporters. Many are volunteering now for Blackburn and other Trump-backed candidates, helping with phone banks, neighborhood canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.
The state party leaders who didn’t support Trump initially have “figured out they have to help him,” says Todd Fowler, who heads the local party in Johnson City, Tennessee, and serves on the state party’s executive committee. “Tennessee likes what he’s doing.”
In Pennsylvania, where Trump’s 2016 win was razor-thin, his support is mostly concentrated in rural and working-class areas. Polls show Trump’s pick for governor, Scott Wagner, running well behind incumbent Democratic Governor Tom Wolf.
Trump is drawing people to congressional campaigns in Pennsylvania, but they are coming “very tentatively,” says Eugene Sorrentino, 76, a retired power company technician and member of the local Republican committee in Erie, Pennsylvania.
Sorrentino recently staffed a welcome tent set up by the party at a county fair and “all I heard was requests for Trump paraphernalia,” he said. The congressional races “weren’t on their agenda,” he added.
'TRUMP BUMP'
In Trump’s strongholds, his ability to help candidates goes beyond a bounce in the polls. Nearly all the Trump-backed campaigns contacted by Reuters reported a surge of volunteer activism – a “Trump bump” – after the president’s endorsement.
In Western Pennsylvania, a corner where Trump is enormously popular, U.S. Representative Mike Kelly says his campaign relies heavily on MAGA volunteers. Kelly’s district, redrawn this year, includes counties where Trump won by as much as 20 points in 2016, according to PlanScore.org, a nonpartisan group.
Trump provides “that shot of adrenaline you need from time to time,” Kelly told Reuters as he prepared to join the president for an Oct. 10 rally in Erie.
One engine for turning out Trump’s base in his stronghold regions is America First Action, a “Super PAC” allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections. 
The group has spent more than $26 million on phone messaging and advertising in five battleground Senate races – Arizona, Montana, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota – and across 11 congressional districts in Texas, Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina.
It is run by Trump loyalists and relies on big donations from Republican Party stalwarts, including casino magnates Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn and mining engineer and businessman Robert Murray.
In an Oct. 1 memo, White House political director Bill Stepian advised congressional campaigns that the best way to capture MAGA support is to align “closely, clearly and boldly” with Trump. The president, he wrote, is “ready, willing and able to put the power and force of his coalition to work for the candidates with whom he stands, and who stand with him.”
At the national level, Republican Party officials have fallen in line and embraced the president, routinely echoing Trump’s nationalist campaign themes. But for candidates in areas where the president doesn't dominate the electorate, embracing Trump has mixed success.
In Florida, where Trump prevailed by one point in 2016, he endorsed Republican gubernatorial candidate and die-hard supporter Ron DeSantis before the party primary. But now, in a state that hasn’t elected a Democratic governor in 20 years, DeSantis is polling slightly behind in the general election contest against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee.
Some Republican candidates in areas with moderate voters who view Trump less favorably have steered clear of the president, a Reuters analysis found last month.
PARTY TAKEOVER
MAGA supporters have become a force in many state party offices, including some states outside the president’s established southern and western strongholds.
In Ohio, a swing state where Trump won by eight points in 2016, the state Republican Party selected Jane Timken, a Trump friend and loyalist, to take over as chairwoman in the wake of the election.
In Nevada, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential vote, the state Republican Party has launched weekly events, such as MAGA Mondays and Trump Tuesdays, to attract the president’s supporters.
Rochelle Swanson, 30, a MAGA activist in Reno who began posting pro-Trump articles and interviewing local Republican candidates on social media, was asked by a party official in July to help with voter outreach. She now aligns her social media and canvassing with the party’s messaging, she says, and “there is good unity happening.”
Yet even as MAGA supporters have become woven into the fabric of the Republican Party, many acknowledge it will be a challenge to preserve their coalition and continue shaping U.S. politics once Trump leaves office. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month, more than a quarter of Trump voters said they did not know who would carry Trump’s vision if he leaves politics.
“I don’t think anybody could take Trump’s spot,” said Jeremy Messina, a MAGA activist in upstate New York who runs a political advertising media company. “I don’t see it.”

More than 2 million Venezuelans have emigrated amid food and medicine shortages and profound political divisions in their country, according to figures from the United Nations. Half have opted to live in Colombia, and many have arrived with only what they could carry.
Providing migrants access to healthcare, utilities and education will cost Colombia between 0.26 percent and 0.41 percent of its gross domestic product this year, the report said, adding that the country must make medium-term investments to improve those services.
But legalizing migrants - some of whom cross the two countries' porous border without visas or other permissions - will help them find formal jobs and increase tax revenue and consumption, the report said.
""Despite short-term negative impacts, the evidence suggests that if adequate policy decisions are taken, migration has the potential to generate growth in Colombia,"" the report said.
Colombian President Ivan Duque says Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro is a dictator, and he has promised to continue to accept migrants. 
Of the 1.03 million Venezuelans living in Colombia, more than half a million have visas or other legal permission, while 240,000 are in the process of acquiring temporary permission. The remaining 217,000 lack authorization to stay.
Some 3,000 migrants arrive in Colombia each day, and the government says 4 million could be living in the country by 2021, costing Colombia nearly $9 billion. 
The European Union, United Nations and the United States have given millions in aid money to help Colombia cope with the migrant influx.

Maduro and other top officials of Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party have dismissed migration figures as stemming from politically motivated alarmism and ""fake news"" meant to justify foreign intervention in Venezuela's affairs.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. government has approved integration of the U.S. Patriot PAC-3 MSE missile into a next-generation German missile defense system, a spokesman said on Friday, a key step toward completion of a long-delayed multibillion-dollar arms sale.
The decision followed high-level talks by German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis this summer, two sources familiar with the issue said.
Germany selected the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and European missile maker MBDA over Raytheon's Patriot air and missile defense system in 2015, but it has taken years to move forward on the new defensive system called TLVS. 
U.S. Air Force Col. Mike Andrews, the Pentagon spokesman, confirmed the use of the MSE missile had been approved for use in the German program, but gave no further details.
""This is a significant step forward. The impasse has been solved,"" said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Lockheed, the top U.S. weapons maker, and MBDA gave no details, but said they were upbeat that the program was moving forward. MBDA is jointly owned by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo.
A spokesman at the German defense ministry gave no details, but said both the U.S. and German sides were committed to signing a contract. ""There is new momentum. Both sides are clearly committed to successful completion of the TLVS program,"" the spokesman said.
Germany's defense ministry in August asked Lockheed and MBDA to submit a best and final offer for the program, but that required U.S. government approval of the integration of the PAC-3 MSE missile, one of the sources said.
Lockheed, which developed the MEADS program together with MBDA, also builds the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement missile, but needed approval for its integration into German program since the missile was developed separately from MEADS.
The MEADS system was developed with $4 billion in funding from Germany, Italy and the United States, although the U.S. Army later ended its participation in the program.
Germany hopes to sign a contract for TLVS in 2019 and field the system in 2025.
MBDA and Lockheed executives have said progress on the German deal could fuel interest by other countries in the system, which will offer the ability to knit together a variety of different systems, including Patriot.
Initially slated to cost about 4 billion euros ($4.56 billion), sources say the final cost of the TLVS system is likely to be several billion euros higher.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The order to kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi came from the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in the Washington Post on Friday and he called for the ""puppetmasters"" to be unmasked.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul exactly one month ago on Oct. 2.
Erdogan, in an op-ed piece in the newspaper, said he did not believe ""for a second"" that King Salman had ordered ""the hit"" on Khashoggi and he also refrained from directly accusing the crown prince.
An adviser to Erdogan said last week that MbS, as the crown prince is informally known, had ""blood on his hands"" over Khashoggi’s killing, the bluntest comments yet from someone linked to Erdogan about Riyadh's de facto ruler in connection with the death. 
The Saudi government initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, later saying he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". Last week, the kingdom's public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb said the attack was premeditated.
""No one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again. If anyone chooses to ignore that warning, they will face severe consequences,"" Erdogan warned in the op-ed piece.
""PUPPETMASTERS""
Erdogan accused the Saudi consul in Istanbul of lying ""through his teeth"" and the Saudi chief prosecutor of refusing to cooperate, stalling the process and not answering simple questions.
Erdogan said there was more to Khashoggi's death than just action by ""a group of security officials,"" he said.
""As responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppetmasters behind Khashoggi’s killing and discover those in whom Saudi officials — still trying to cover up the murder — have placed their trust.""
Earlier on Friday, another Erdogan adviser said the team that killed Khashoggi in Istanbul cut up his body in order to dissolve it for easier disposal, the newspaper Hurriyet reported.
Yasin Aktay, who advises Erdogan and was a friend of Khashoggi's, told Hurriyet that the body was disposed of by dismembering and dissolving.
""According to the latest information we have, the reason they dismembered his body is to dissolve it easier.""

Relations between the two have improved markedly since Ireland gained independence from Britain following a bloody struggle almost a century ago.
But ties have been tested over the last two years with Ireland a key player on the opposite side of the Brexit negotiating table to Britain. Arguments over how to manage the border between EU-member state Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland have threatened the talks.
""What we've agreed is that we should aim for a model which is based upon a pattern of top level summits involving heads of government and senior ministers, probably alternating between the United Kingdom and Ireland year-by-year, and backed up by close bilateral work between ministers,"" Britain's Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told a news conference.
""There is that shared commitment that we are not going to let political turbulence, which is a reality at the moment, deflect us from recognizing that we have so much in common and so much both to gain from continued close work together.""
Lidington, Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy, was speaking after a meeting of a British-Irish cooperative body that was convened for the first time in a decade earlier this year as a result of a political deadlock in Northern Ireland.
Britain and Ireland are co-guarantors of the 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in the province and introduced devolved government. However the power-sharing executive has not met for almost two years following a breakdown between Irish nationalist and pro-British unionist politicians.
Lidington said officials would come up with proposals by early next year to replace the current regular meetings at EU meetings that helped improve the ""indispensable relationship"". 
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney also sought to play down a number of recent newspaper stories that highlighted a deterioration in relations between the neighboring countries.

""Some of what you read about the stresses and strains that are sometimes reported between the British and Irish government, on a personal that is certainly not the case,"" Coveney said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians fear an even more painful squeeze on living costs after additional U.S. sanctions take effect on Monday, from businesses struggling to buy raw materials to the sick and elderly unable to afford life-saving medicines.
The United States will reapply curbs to the country's vital petroleum and banking sectors on Monday in an effort to rein in its arch foe's nuclear, missile and regional activities.
Iran's clerical rulers have played down the U.S. move, but many ordinary Iranians appear apprehensive.
""All the prices are going higher every day ... I cannot imagine what will happen after 13 Aban (Nov. 4). I am scared. I am worried. I am desperate,"" said elementary school teacher Pejman Sarafnejad, 43, a father of three in Tehran.
""I cannot even buy rice to feed my children or pay my rent.""
The daily struggle to make ends meet has been getting harder for months: The economy was battered by the reimposition of a first raft of U.S. curbs in August after Washington's pullout from a nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers in May.
Foreign businesses of all types, ranging from oil companies, trading houses to shipping, have stopped doing business with Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties.
A Tehran Grand bazaar grocery shop owner said: ""I am very nervous because already there is shortage of some goods in the market and the rial has lost so much value. 
""What will happen after the reimposition of new sanctions?""
Iran's leadership says Tehran will not succumb to pressure to halt its missile programs or to change its regional policy. 
""POLITICAL SLOGANS"" 
Yet while some Iranians back their leaders' defiance, others are fearful that the economy, weakened by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, may collapse when the U.S. puts more pressure on the world's Number 3 crude exporter. 
""Statements by government officials that ... the sanctions (will) have no impact are political slogans,"" said Washington-based lawyer Farhad Alavi, who focuses on U.S. trade regulation and sanctions. 
""The fact is that these restrictions significantly increase transaction costs for Iranians."" 
Since the reimposition of the first round of curbs in August, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the rial national currency has fallen sharply. 
Rice, one of the staples of Iran's diet, has more than tripled in price since last year because of the rial's fall.
Ordinary Iranians fear cuts in Iran's oil sales could be the ultimate hammer blow to the economy, since energy exports are still the country's main source of earnings.
Iranian leaders hope sanctions waivers granted to eight buyers of Iranian crude, combined with rising oil prices, will compensate for a reduction oil export volumes.
But even without the new measures due on Monday, Iranian businessmen have been finding it harder to cope.
Some 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have already started to shut down in the past months due to lack of raw materials and hard currency, according to Iranian media.
LIFE GROWS HARDER
""I had to close my business. Those European companies that were racing to ink a deal with me last year, now refuse to return my calls,"" said a businessman in Tehran, who declined to be named.
Mohammad Reza Sadoughi says ordinary people will bear the brunt of the sanctions, in terms of medicines for the sick such as cancer patients and food shortages and currency problems. 
""My father has cancer, and with sanctions, the cancer-treatment medicine that his life depends on will only be available in the black market for a higher price,"" said the 38-year-old government employee in the northern city of Sari.
The U.S. sanctions permits trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals. Yet measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions will make life hard for Iranian patients.
""At the end of the day, it's the Iranian people with their aspiration to lead a good life who are suffering due to lack of good sense from their own regime who are not ready to compromise with the world power (U.S.),"" said Dubai-based businessman Aftab Hasan, a member of the Iranian Business Council in Dubai. 
However analysts say that economic grievances are unlikely to revive anti-government unrest such as the demonstrations in December that turned into anti-government rallies. 
""I don't care about politics. I don't care who is responsible for our problems. I don't want a regime change. I just want to live peacefully with my family in my country,"" said housewife Fariba Shakouri, 51, in the central city of Yazd.

Backing from Schaeuble, the former finance minister who drove Europe's fiscally austere response to southern Europe's debt crisis after 2008, would give a stiff tailwind to businessman Friedrich Merz's candidacy.
The next party leader will be in pole position to succeed Merkel as chancellor of Europe's economic powerhouse, though Merkel has said she wants to remain in post for three more years after quitting the CDU leadership.
Victory for Merz in next month's party leadership election would signal a shift toward the low-tax, business-friendly right-wing conservatism that Merkel has pushed into the background during her 13 years as chancellor.
Schaeuble, like Merz, once was tipped as a future leader and chancellor before Merkel outmaneuvered first one then the other.
Surveys suggest that Merz - who holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, enjoys more public support than CDU general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, seen as the heir to Merkel's centrist course.
A survey by pollster Civey for newspaper Die Welt found that 49 percent of voters believe that of the three candidates seeking the CDU chair, Merz is the most capable of improving the party's election results.
The survey showed that 19 percent of the 5,045 voters polled on Thursday and Friday believed Kramp-Karrenbauer would be best at boosting the CDU, with just 6 percent backing the third candidate, Health Minister Jens Spahn.
According to Der Spiegel, Schaeuble urged Merz to throw his hat into the ring after Merkel announced her withdrawal following setbacks in two regional elections.
He also set up meetings with Joseph Daul, leader of the main Europe-wide conservative party grouping in Brussels, and other influential party players in Germany.
Merz has coined the idea of a German 'Leitkultur', or 'lead culture', with which he called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German values and traditions.
He served in the German parliament from 1994 to 2009, including two years as parliamentary leader of the conservative bloc. He also is known for a proposal to simplify the annual tax return so that it could be written on a beer mat.

No response to the Spiegel report was immediately available from the parliamentary press office.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration's decision to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census questionnaire could undermine the quality of the data by discouraging non-citizens from responding, the U.S. Census Bureau's chief scientist said.
But, added John Abowd in written testimony seen by Reuters, the question will not necessarily lead to an undercount, because the government has strategies to ""mitigate these effects.""
Abowd's declaration, which has not previously been made public, comes as the administration of President Donald Trump prepares to defend the controversial policy shift in a two-week trial scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in New York.
The addition of the citizenship question was announced in March by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who billed it as a way to enforce the Voting Rights Act. The act requires a tally of citizens of voting age to protect minorities against discrimination.
Eighteen states and 15 cities have since sued the administration, arguing that the new question is actually intended to depress participation in the Census by immigrants, who tend to reside in Democratic-leaning areas.
If undercounted, areas with high immigrant populations could lose seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as their share of more than $800 billion in federal aid, both of which are allocated based on population data.
Abowd, the government's main witness in the trial, acknowledged in his declaration that the question could ""lower the quality of census data.""
But he said there was ""no quantitative evidence"" it would lead to an undercount, citing other means of enumeration, like following up with non-responders, gathering data from existing government records, and estimating data that cannot be found directly.
Earlier this year, Abowd was among the Census Bureau officials that advised Ross against adding the question, saying it could discourage participation.
Some census experts argue that, while there is no data suggesting the citizenship question will lower the overall count, there is also no evidence to the contrary.
Former U.S. Census Bureau Director John Thompson, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, said in a September declaration that ""obtaining such documentation would involve a multi-year testing"" program.
The Trump administration has denied any pretext for adding the question, saying the rationale is supported by ""an extensive administrative record,"" and is legally enforceable even if the plaintiffs show that Ross may have had other motivations for the decision. 
The government argues that in order to block the question, plaintiffs would need to prove that the bureau would be unable to avoid an undercount. Abowd's testimony is central to the government's defense on that point.
While the trial is set to start Monday, the Trump Administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to delay it.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday appealed for an end to the war in Yemen and laid out steps the parties in the conflict must take to move forward, warning that continued fighting would result in the country's worst famine in a decade.
""Yemen today stands on a precipice. On the humanitarian side, the situation is desperate. We must do all we can to prevent the already dire conditions from deteriorating,"" Guterres told reporters at the United Nations.
He said recent political developments had created signs of hope for a settlement, and he urged the warring parties to halt the violence, especially around cities and critical infrastructure.
Guterres' remarks come three days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a cessation of hostilities and said U.N.-led negotiations to end the war should begin in November. 
Several other countries have also joined the call for an end to the conflict. 
""We must do all we can to maximize the chances for success,"" Guterres said.
He called for commercial and humanitarian imports of food, fuel and other essentials to be allowed without restrictions, and urged the sides to allow roads to remain open so ""life-saving goods can reach communities across the country.""
He called on Yemeni parties to engage in good faith negotiations, without preconditions, with U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths to reach a negotiated political settlement.
""The international community has a real opportunity to halt the senseless cycle of violence and to prevent an imminent catastrophe,"" Guterres said. ""The time to act is now.""
Despite the appeals, fighting continued on Friday, with the Saudi-led coalition saying it had attacked Sanaa International Airport and an adjoining air base being used by Houthi insurgents.
Guterres said he was appealing to both sides to halt the violence and to preserve important infrastructure.
""The appeal is to all of them (to) embark in the cessation of hostilities sooner rather than later, immediately in our opinion, in order to allow for the political process to start,"" he said. ""Obviously we are not yet there. That is why we are appealing for the kind of military action that is taking place from both sides to end.""

Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The Saudi government initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate and later that he had died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". Last week, the kingdom's public prosecutor said the attack on the journalist had been premeditated.
Istanbul chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said this week that Khashoggi was suffocated as soon as he entered the consulate, and his body then cut up and disposed of. Turkey has demanded cooperation from Saudi officials.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), on Thursday criticized the investigation, saying he would sue President Tayyip Erdogan and his government for letting the culprits leave Turkey.
Omer Celik, the spokesman for Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said on Friday legal action would be taken against Kilicdaroglu over the comments.
""This is very embarrassing and a very sad picture. It is disgraceful that he has such an approach. Turkey doesn't deserve this,"" he told a news conference in Ankara.
""We will file a criminal complaint against him for the black propaganda he is carrying out and the accusation he is throwing around. He will be answered legally, legal action will be taken.""

Khashoggi's killing has led to Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, facing a torrent of international condemnation, upending the young crown prince's image as a reformer on the international stage.

HELSINKI/BERLIN (Reuters) - He was too sporty, too international and too outspoken for his small country -- but he has no qualms about campaigning to become the next European Commission President. 
Alexander Stubb, who was Finland's prime minister and then finance minister before being ditched by his own party in 2016, is the only declared rival to Germany's more conservative Manfred Weber in the race to lead the center-right European People's Party (EPP) into next year's EU election.
The winner will instantly become favorite to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission, the EU's most powerful job.
Stubb, a prolific Twitter user known for doing ""Iron Man"" triathlons, is a clear underdog, but a strong showing could put the 50-year-old enthusiast for European integration in line for another top job, such as EU foreign policy chief.
""If you look at the numbers, the chances (of winning) are quite slim,"" he admitted in Berlin on a tour of EU capitals ahead of the EPP vote in Helsinki on Nov. 8.
""The most important thing for me is to stand up on the barricades and defend European values, and drive the pro-European agenda against the grain ... It feels bloody good. Winning the race is almost irrelevant.""
He has harsh words for Italy, which is in a budget standoff with the EU, and says he would kick Hungary's anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orban, out of the EPP if he was unwilling to stick to common values.
""Alex's positive campaign, added to the fact that everybody knows him, gives Finland a better chance of success in the post-election game of musical chairs,"" said Stubb's friend and countryman, EU Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen.
SLICK IMAGE
Stubb, who holds an economics PhD from the London School of Economics, was popular at home when he was elected to the European Parliament in 2004.
He then served as Finland's foreign minister and EU minister and sought nomination as an EU commissioner in 2014, before Katainen unexpectedly quit as premier to take the job himself.
Stubb then took over the helm of the National Coalition Party and became prime minister for a year. 
But his slick image and outspokenness complicated cooperation with more cautious figures such as the president, party sources said. When he wore shorts and sandals to meet reporters at the end of his vacation, eyebrows were raised. 
After an election that saw his party slip to junior coalition partner, Stubb became finance minister.
The missteps began to accumulate.
He gave parliament incorrect information about a proposed securities register. As the pressure mounted, a man threw a drink in his face in a cafeteria, and two men fired an air rifle at his home during the night.
Johanna Vuorelma, political analyst at Helsinki University, said Stubb did not fit the mould of a politician in Finland, where modesty and ordinariness are considered virtues. 
""He seemed so overwhelming with all the languages he spoke, the exceptional social skills and strong networks he possessed,"" she said.

In June 2016, his party decided enough was enough, and dismissed him as leader and finance minister. Last year, he became vice president of the European Investment Bank.

If negotiations succeed, the ruling coalition - which currently consists of the Conservatives, Liberals and the anti-immigration Progress Party - will become a majority government that is likely to stay until the parliamentary election in 2021.
The coalition had been severely weakened by disagreements over issues ranging from social policy to immigration. 
Delegates at a congress of the small centrist party voted 98-90 in favor of negotiations with Solberg's cabinet, rejecting a proposal from party leader Knut Arild Hareide to switch allegiance to Labour and form a center-left government.
Hareide had said before the vote that he would step down if his proposal was rejected.
""I have to accept the result, but I am disappointed,"" Hareide said, adding that he was proud of how the party had handled the process.
Surveys of delegates ahead of the party congress had shown that a majority favored teaming up with Solberg.

The Christian Democrats won 4.2 percent of the vote in the 2017 election for parliament, down from a record 13.7 percent two decades earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly 40 years after the 1979 Islamic revolution saw the exit of Western oil companies from Iran, the Iranian oil sector faces yet another costly disruption after a series of interruptions from war, sanctions and diplomatic isolation.
Washington will reapply sanctions to Iran's oil sector on Nov. 4, after ending its participation in an international deal governing Iran's nuclear sector. Iran's oil buyers outside the United States will stop or reduce purchases because of secondary sanctions applied on foreign companies that use the U.S. banking system.
Having lifted a self-imposed revolutionary ban on foreign investors in 1995, Iran has struggled to attract external investment for any sustained period. 
The isolation caused by poor relations with the United States and, in recent years, Tehran's efforts to develop a nuclear capability have prevented Iran building output capacity. 
But huge reserves run by the National Iranian Oil Co have helped it cling to its position as one of the world's five largest oil producers. 
The United States stopped buying Iranian oil or investing in Iran's oil industry in 1979 and has not resumed since. 
Iran's crude oil exports from 1975-2018: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CUMBnT
Iran produces nearly 4 percent of the world's daily oil supply and over the last 30 years has exported on average two-thirds of that.
The mid-1970s were the heyday of the Iranian oil sector, when its output accounted for 10 percent of global production. 
It has never returned to the record 6 million barrels per day (bpd) it pumped in 1974. 
In that year it pumped 70 percent of the amount produced by OPEC's biggest producer, its regional political rival Saudi Arabia, and more than three times as much as its neighbor Iraq. 
In 2012, when a first round of international nuclear sanctions was imposed, Iran's output was only a third of Saudi Arabia's, rising to 41 percent last year and just a little higher than Iraq's. 
Output dropped to a low of 1.5 million bpd in 1980, the year after Shah Mohammed Reza was overthrown, an event that caused the second oil shock across the economies of the West. 
It took 23 years for Iran to restore 4 million bpd in 2003, with a post-revolutionary peak last year just short of 5 million bpd of crude and condensate combined. 
Iran's crude oil exports and production: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CRTM0h
Iran's exports halved during the depths of the 2012-2016 international sanctions on its nuclear program. 
It is unclear what proportion of Iranian crude sales will vanish from international markets after Nov. 4. The United States said on Friday it would temporarily spare from sanctions eight jurisdictions that import Iranian oil. The European Union would not be one of the eight, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
This isn't Iran's first round of sanctions. It has devised ways to export oil under the radar, evading detection by switching off the transponders of its fleet of nearly 40 supertankers, using alternatives to the U.S. dollar for payment, or selling crude to private refiners, in small, harder-to-track parcels.
Below is a timeline of the evolution of Iran's crude oil production and exports, through sanctions, war and embargoes.

Israeli troops wounded seven people when they opened fire on protesters but there were no fatalities, Gaza health officials said. The Israeli military confirmed it had shot at them.
Nearly 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during almost seven months of protests, according to Gaza figures.
Palestinians say they are protesting against Israel's blockade of the territory and in support of a right for Palestinian refugees to return to land lost during Israel's founding in 1948.
The weekly protests in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip began in March and at times have attracted tens of thousands of people.
But on Friday, when Egyptian officials, who have been shuttling between Israel and Gaza, made a rare visit to the frontier, just several thousand showed up.
Protestors still set fire to tires but fewer in number.
The Israeli military, which usually says Palestinians attack the border fence during the protest, said that while there were indeed disturbances, much of the crowd kept their distance.
A Palestinian official familiar with the Egyptian mediation said the goal was to end the protests and in return secure an easing of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza.
Israel accuses Hamas of orchestrating the demonstrations to provide cover for attacks and distract from Gaza’s economic plight, allegations it denies.

Hamas seized control of Gaza from Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 and has since fought three wars with Israel, most recently in 2014.

In an interview published on Friday by Correio Braziliense newspaper, Bolsonaro criticized the Mais Medicos (More Doctors) program under which 11,420 Cuban doctors work in poor or remote parts of Brazil.
He said that 75 percent of the doctors' salaries was paid to Cuba's government and their children were not allowed to join them in Brazil, citing the case of a doctor whose three young children had to stay in Cuba.
""That is just torture for a mother,"" Bolsonaro said. ""Can we maintain diplomatic relations with a country that treats its people that way?""
Bolsonaro said the program, begun by leftist former president Dilma Rousseff to provide medical attention in areas where Brazilian doctors did not want to serve, could continue, but Cuban doctors would have to get their full pay and have their children with them.
Bolsonaro, who was elected last week, takes office on Jan. 1 and promises the biggest shift in Brazilian foreign policy in decades. 

He will seek closer relations with the United States and confirmed on Thursday that he plans to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead and move Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

With days to go before mid-term elections, U.S. President Donald Trump has called the surge of people an ""invasion"", ordered troops to the border and suggested any rock-throwing by migrants should be treated as equivalent to gunfire.
Joel Millman, a spokesman for the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration (IOM), told a U.N. briefing in Geneva there had been similar caravans for many years, and the group was still hundreds of miles away from the United States. 
""So (using) words like 'invasion' and things like that is assuming that this is a new phenomenon which is a drastic emergency, and I don’t think that anyone at IOM would share that view,"" he said.
""This is kind of a normal event."" 
Militarised frontiers tended not to deter people from crossing borders, he added. Instead, they increased the profits of criminal people-smuggling gangs and led to deaths among migrants.
""Militarising the border is not something we are ever in favor of,"" he said.
The migrant group has become a major issue in campaigning for the elections on Nov. 6, when Republicans will seek to maintain control of both congressional chambers.
""We are calling for humanity and taking things away from politics,"" Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said at the briefing. 
Mexico on Wednesday put the size of the migrant group that left Honduras in mid-October at 2,800 to 3,000 people. Others have since followed. 
The Pentagon said on Wednesday more than 7,000 troops would support the Department of Homeland Security along the Mexican border. Trump said as many as 15,000 could be sent.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Muslim cleric Sami ul-Haq, known as the ""Father of the Taliban"" for having taught some of the Afghan Islamist movement's leaders, was found killed on Friday in a Pakistani city, a relative and his deputy said.
Unknown attackers killed the cleric, who runs an Islamic seminary in northwestern Pakistan, his deputy Yousaf Shah said.
There were conflicting reports of exactly how he was killed and why his bodyguard and driver were apparently not there to defend him at the time of the attack.
Shah initially said that Haq had been shot dead.
Haq's nephew Mohammad Bilal told Reuters that his uncle was found with stabbing and gunshot wounds in a house he owns in an upscale area on Islamabad's outskirts. ""When the assailants entered his house ... They first started hitting Mullah Sami ul-Haq with knives and daggers and then shot him dead,"" he said.
Further details remained unclear.
Haq has run the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghanistan border, for decades.
One of his students from the 1980s, known later as Mullah Mohammad Omar, went along with classmates to Afghanistan to join mujahideen groups fighting against the Soviet occupation of the country.
Mullah Omar went on to found the Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan in 1996 after years of chaos and civil war following the Soviet military's withdrawal.
The ultra-conservative Taliban imposed an extreme version of Islamic sharia law on Afghanistan that included forbidding women to leave home without a male relative, imposing minimum lengths on men's beards and banning sports, radio and television.
Haq's seminary has continued to thrive in Pakistan, including being allocated funding in provincial government budgets.
Pakistan's Interior Ministry confirmed Haq's death in a statement on Friday evening, and expressed condolences.

WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States and Turkey on Friday mutually lifted sanctions on top government officials, a sign of a thaw in relations that had been chilled by Ankara's detention of an American Christian pastor.
The United States had imposed sanctions on Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu in August to protest the case of Andrew Brunson, an American Christian pastor who had been detained by Turkey for two years.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced on its website that the sanctions had been lifted. Turkey immediately matched the U.S. move by lifting sanctions on two corresponding U.S. officials - U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the foreign ministry said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed to mutually lift the sanctions during a phone call last week, said Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkey's ruling AK Party.
""It is an important step for normalization from this point forward,"" Celik said. The White House did not have any immediate comment.
Tensions between the NATO allies on this and other issues have weighed on the Turkish economy. After Friday's move, Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds jumped, with many issues adding 1 cent or more.
Brunson, who had lived in Turkey for more than 20 years, was swept up in raids after a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan. He was jailed two years ago and up until his release last month had been under house arrest since July, accused of links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric blamed by Turkey's government for the coup attempt.
Brunson maintained his innocence, and his case was championed by U.S. evangelical Christians.
After a July deal to free Brunson fell apart, Washington imposed sanctions and tariffs on Ankara that sent the lira tumbling.
Relations have also been strained by U.S. support of Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, Turkey's plans to purchase a Russian missile defense system and the U.S. jailing of an executive of a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions case.

Washington has also been pushing Turkey to release Turkish- American Serkan Golge, a former NASA scientist, who was arrested in the 2016 crackdown, as well as Turkish citizens employed by the U.S. State Department who were detained in the sweeps.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin praised the skill and ""unique abilities"" of Russia's military spies on Friday in a show of support for an intelligence agency that the West has blamed for a string of brazen attacks.
At a ceremony marking the centenary of Russia's military intelligence agency, Putin, in comments likely to be seen as provocative in the West, saluted its operatives for carrying out daring special operations and said they provided a model for a future generation. 
Britain has accused the GRU agency of attempting to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury, the Netherlands has accused it of trying to hack the global chemical weapons watchdog, and U.S. intelligence agencies have accused it of trying to hack the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Russia denies all those allegations.
""As supreme commander, I of course know with no exaggeration about your unique abilities including in conducting special operations,"" said Putin. 
""I am confident of your professionalism, of your personal daring and decisiveness and that each of you will do all that is required by Russia and our people.""
The operatives of the agency, widely known by its old acronym of GRU, set an example for a future generation of military spies, he added, citing their readiness to sacrifice everything ""for the motherland."" 
Speaking at the closed ceremony at the Russian Army's theater in Moscow which was broadcast on national television, Putin also thanked military intelligence officers for their ""huge role"" in liquidating militant leaders and infrastructure in Syria.
He also spoke of the need to help the agency develop and upgrade its capabilities.
The GRU has been in the spotlight since two men whom London blames for the Skripal poisoning admitted on Russian TV they had been in Salisbury on the day of the attack, but said they had only been there to see the city's famous cathedral spire. 
Putin, himself a former intelligence officer who served as director of the domestic intelligence service before ascending to the presidency, makes regular public shows of support for Russia's spies. 
In 2010, he recounted at length about how he met a ring of Russian agents who were arrested for espionage in the United States and sang patriotic songs with them after they were returned to Russia in a spy swap. 
The GRU was founded as the Registration Directorate in 1918 after the Bolshevik Revolution. Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services, which saw it as a rival.

The GRU is one of Russia's three main intelligence agencies, alongside the domestic Federal Security Service and the SVR Foreign Intelligence Service.

Zitto Kabwe, a regular critic of the government, told a news conference on Sunday that at least 100 people died during clashes in Kigoma in mid October.
He was detained three days later, then charged in court on Friday and released on a 10 million shilling ($4,400) bond, his Alliance for Change and Transparency-Wazalendo party said.
Kigoma Police Commander Martin Ottieno told Reuters that just two herdsmen and two officers had died during an operation to stop the pastoralists keeping livestock illegally on a government-owned ranch.
Friday's charge sheet said Kabwe ""with intent to bring hatred to the citizens of ... Tanzania against the lawful authority of the government ... issued a press release to the public with seditious words against the Tanzania police force.” 
Kabwe pleaded not guilty, his wife Anna Bwana said on WhatsApp.
Kabwe split away from the main opposition CHADEMA movement in 2015 and is now his party's only MP.
The East African country has been one of the continent's most stable, but opposition leaders and rights groups have accused the government of cracking down on dissent - an accusation it dismisses.

Two opposition leaders were sentenced to five months in prison in February for insulting President John Magufuli.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",U.S. forces patrol border between north Syria and Turkey: SDF,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian Kurdish-led forces said on Friday that U.S. troops have started patrolling the Syrian border with Turkey to defuse tensions after threats from Ankara.
In response to questions from Reuters, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said it carries out regular military visits in the region and had not increased patrols. 
Turkish forces have shelled positions this week in northern Syria under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Washington trains and arms. 
The SDF alliance, which the Kurdish YPG militia spearheads, returned fire and pledged to respond to any more attacks. 
Ankara has repeatedly warned it would launch a cross-border offensive east of the Euphrates River in Syria if the U.S. military does not ensure the YPG's withdrawal.
Washington's support for the YPG has infuriated Ankara, which sees it as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has waged an insurgency inside Turkey for decades. 
President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday vowed to crush Syrian Kurdish fighters east of the Euphrates, where some 2,000 U.S. forces stand alongside the SDF. 
""This morning, the (U.S.-led) international coalition held patrols monitoring the border between northern Syria and Turkey to reduce tensions,"" said Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office. 
The SDF put out a video it said showed military vehicles driving along a road in the border town of Kobani. Spokesman Kino Gabriel said new border patrols by U.S. and allied forces sought to ward off any more Turkish attacks. 
""The situation is still tense, nothing is clear,"" he told Reuters. ""We will wait and see the result of negotiations and pressure by the Americans on the Turkish government.""
The SDF, the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State, controls swathes of the north and east - the biggest chunk of Syria outside state rule.
The SDF general command said Turkish attacks led to a pause in its assault against Islamic State militants in the eastern Deir al-Zor region.
The U.S. State Department said American officials had contacted Turkey and the SDF to ""emphasize the need to de-escalate the situation.""
Over the past two years, Turkish forces have swept into parts of Syria to push Kurdish fighters out of territory west of the Euphrates. Previous offensives halted at the banks of the river, partly to avoid confrontation with U.S. troops stationed further east.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemeni children are dying from starvation and disease as trucks with life-saving supplies are blocked in port, leaving medical staff and desperate mothers imploring aid workers to do more, a senior U.N. official said.
Geert Cappelaere, Middle East director for the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), described ""heart-breaking"" scenes of emaciated children in hospitals in the main port city of Hodeidah and the capital Sanaa, both held by Houthi insurgents.
""We have evidence that today in Yemen every 10 minutes a child under the age of 5 is dying from preventable diseases and severe acute malnutrition,"" he told Reuters from Hodeidah.
The United Nations says about 14 million people, or half Yemen's population, could soon be on the brink of famine in a man-made disaster.
Already 1.8 million Yemeni children are malnourished, more than 400,000 of them suffering from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition that leaves them skeletal with muscle wasting, Cappelaere said.
""But there is more. Many children are dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. Today not more than 40 percent of the children throughout Yemen are being vaccinated,"" he said.
Measles, cholera and diphtheria can be deadly for children, especially those under five, and are exacerbated by malnutrition. 
""Because of this brutal war, because of obstacles, obstructions being made, it is unfortunately not possible do much more,"" Cappelaere said.
""We may not yet be at the level of a famine but we should not wait until we have declared a famine to step up and to pressure the parties to the conflict to stop this senseless war,"" he said.
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths aims to convene peace talks this month to seek a ceasefire in the three-and-half year war, which pits the Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and the Iran-allied Houthi insurgents. 
As Cappelaere spoke, coaltion forces were massing for an assault on Hodeidah.
""HEART-BREAKING""
Seven trucks carrying life-saving medical equipment and medicines had been blocked at Hodeidah port for two weeks awaiting clearance after being off-loaded, Cappelaere said.
""It was heart-breaking that an hour before I was sitting at al-Thwara hospital, and I have all the doctors, all the medical staff pleading with me to get more medical supplies, to get more medicines,"" he said.
A UNICEF spokeswoman said the trucks had been cleared by Houthi authorities on Friday and supplies would be distributed.
Several extremely malnourished children were in the hospital ward, Cappelaere said.
""All the mothers were telling me that they are simply missing that small amount of money to transport their children from their communities to the hospital,"" he said.
Hodeidah is a lifeline for food and other goods for much of the country.
But, said Cappelaere, ""There was hardly any activity in the port. Only one ship was berthed, that was it.
""Today it looks more like a graveyard than anything else.""

A separate meeting between the leaders on Nov. 11 during events in Paris to commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One would be short, said the aide, Yuri Ushakov.
The two leaders have not met face-to-face since a bilateral summit in July in Helsinki that stirred anger in the United States, where Trump was accused of cozying up to the Kremlin.
Asked how long Moscow expected the meeting with Trump to last in Paris, Ushakov told reporters the meeting would be short but that a later meeting on the sidelines of the G20, taking place over Nov 30 and Dec 1, would be ""lengthy and substantive"".
The White House had no immediate comment. 
U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said this week following a trip to Moscow that the White House had formally invited Putin to Washington next year.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Sri Lankan legislator on Friday said he had been offered $2.8 million and a ministerial post by a telephone caller from the opposite camp to switch his support to new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in a week-old political crisis.
President Maithripala Sirisena fired Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister and named Rajapaksa in a surprise move last week that has drawn criticism from political parties and the international community. 
Wickremesinghe called his sacking illegal and demanded a floor test in parliament to show he retains his majority. The session has been set for Wednesday, the speaker of parliament has said. 
On Friday, a member of parliament from Wickremesinghe's party, Palitha Range Bandara, said a caller from the Rajapaksa camp urged him to defect before the parliament session.
""A proxy for Rajapaksa called me today and offered 500 million rupees to support the new prime minister and they also offered a cabinet portfolio,"" Bandara told Reuters. 
He did not identify the caller but said he would go to the country's anti-graft commission with a complaint. 
Rajapaksa's party dismissed the allegation. ""We did not offer money to anybody, we don't have money to offer to anybody,"" said one of its legislators, Mahindananda Aluthgamage. 
""If someone offered him money he can go to police and lodge a complaint.""
The speaker of parliament in the Indian Ocean island, Karu Jayasuriya, said Sirisena had agreed to call parliament on Nov. 7, following calls for an early session to end the crisis. But the president's office has not yet issued a formal statement.
Critics say the longer he delays calling the legislature, the more allegations of defections and bribes will emerge. 
Wickremesinghe's United National Party said 118 lawmakers had met the speaker on Friday in a show of their strength in the 225-member parliament and to demand a parliament session.
""There are dealers going around and trying to buy MPs as if it is a marketplace. This is a shame to the dignity of the MPs,"" Rauff Hakeem, a legislator, told Reuters after meeting the speaker.
The United States and the European Union have urged Sirisena to honor the constitution and said parliament must be allowed to choose its leader.
The European Union could deny Sri Lanka duty-free access to its market if the island backs off its rights commitments, the grouping's envoy has said. 
But Sirisena held his ground, saying he had told UN Secretary General António Guterres in a telephone conversation that his action accorded with the law. 

""I assured him that the appointment of the new Prime Minister has been done in keeping with the constitution of Sri Lanka,"" Sirisena said on social network Twitter.

KABUL (Reuters) - Russia has quietly invited a group of senior Afghan politicians to talks with the Taliban in Moscow, bypassing President Ashraf Ghani's government in a move that has angered officials in Kabul who say it could muddle the U.S.-backed peace process.
The invitations, extended over the past two months by Russian diplomats in Kabul, were confirmed to Reuters by six of the eight leaders, who include former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, or their aides, and by other leading politicians with ties to the Afghan government.
The Russian Embassy in Kabul declined to comment.
Russia in August proposed holding multilateral peace talks in Moscow and invited 12 countries and the Taliban to attend a summit the following month. But the meeting was postponed after Ghani rejected the invitation on the grounds that talks with the Taliban should be led by the Afghan government.
The United States had also declined to attend. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul declined to comment further.
Three senior Afghan officials said the government was unhappy that Moscow was pressing ahead with plans for talks.
""We requested Russia to cancel the summit because talking to the Taliban at multiple forums will further complicate the peace process backed by the U.S., but they rejected the request,"" said a senior Afghan official who has been holding discussions with Russia.
Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that she hoped to be able to announce details of the conference ""in the coming days"".
Zakharova told reporters at a briefing that the date and participant list were being finalised, but that Russia wanted to be absolutely sure before announcing anything publicly. 
NEW PLAYERS
Diplomatic engagement between the Taliban and the United States gained momentum in October, after U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban leaders in Qatar.
But many Afghan politicians say they have been left out of the process.
Karzai, who ran the country for 13 years following the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 but has become a vocal critic of U.S. policy, is among those planning to travel to Moscow.
""Karzai will travel to Moscow because any opportunity for peace talks with the Taliban must not be ignored,"" said Mohammad Yusof Saha, a spokesman for the former president.
Atta Mohammad Noor, a leader in the Jamiat-i Islami party and former governor of the strategic Balkh province, said he too would attend.
Noor, a powerful figure among Afghanistan's ethnic Tajiks who was once a commander in the anti-Soviet Mujahiddin, said he had no problem with the United States and Ghani holding private talks with the Taliban, ""but they cannot decide whether we should talk to the Taliban or not"".
He said many Afghans were realizing that ""a single fixed formula prescribed by one foreign power will not help Afghans attain peace"".
Senior Taliban members in Afghanistan said they would send a delegation to Moscow, as it would give them an opportunity to engage with neighboring countries including China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, who have previously said they would send representatives.
""Most countries have acknowledged our status and invited us as a separate political force. This is, in fact, our victory,"" said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban.
GREATER LEVERAGE
Moscow's strategy of going around Ghani directly to opposition politicians is a concern for the Afghan government and its U.S. sponsors, who see it as unwelcome meddling, according to government officials and diplomats in Kabul.
""Russia is trying to create its own regional table to hold peace talks, they are clearly attempting to limit the U.S. role in Afghanistan,"" said a western diplomat in the Afghan capital.
The Moscow talks underline the increasingly active role Russia is playing in Afghanistan, decades after Soviet forces withdrew from the country, with business investment plans, diplomatic and cultural outreach, and small military support for the central government.
In 2014, it reopened a cultural center in Kabul. Since 2016, it has provided thousands of Kalashnikov rifles to the Afghan government, said a senior foreign ministry official in Kabul.
The talks come also at a time when the Afghan government is struggling to recover control of districts lost to Taliban insurgents while casualties among security forces have reached record levels, a U.S. watchdog agency said.
""It's obvious that the situation in Afghanistan is not improving, that the threat is growing and that the ground is ripe for radical Islamists or followers and participants of the Islamic State project,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign policy expert close to the Kremlin who edits the Russia in Global Affairs journal. 

""The dynamic is negative. I think that's why political and diplomatic efforts are being activated.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong organizers of an exhibition by a dissident Chinese-Australian cartoonist, a persistent thorn in the side of leaders in Beijing, canceled the event in the Chinese-ruled city on Friday given what they said were threats by China.
The exhibition by Badiucao was to have been his first international solo event. His work highlights themes including rights violations and abuse of power under Chinese Communist Party rule and he often satirizes President Xi Jinping.
""We are sorry to announce that the exhibition 'Gongle', by Chinese artist Badiucao, has been canceled out of safety concerns,"" wrote the organizers, Hong Kong Free Press, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, in a statement.
""The decision follows threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist. Whilst the organizers value freedom of expression, the safety of our partners remains a major concern.""
The statement did not specify the threats. China’s representative Liaison Office in Hong Kong could not be reached for comment.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including freedom of expression, not enjoyed elsewhere in China.
But those freedoms have come under threat, pro-democracy activists say, with increased meddling by Beijing.
Badiucao was due to give a question and answer session at the opening alongside members of the Russian anti-Kremlin Pussy Riot punk band, as well as Hong Kong's young democracy leader Joshua Wong.
Badiucao, considered one of the most prominent Chinese political cartoonists, gave no immediate response when contacted by email. 
Amnesty International, one of the co-organizers of the exhibition, expressed concern.
""The threat Badiucao faces exemplifies how much overseas Chinese dissidents need to consider when they do their work,"" said Amnesty China researcher Patrick Poon.
""It's particularly worrying that it happens here in Hong Kong as the space for freedom of expression is eroding further this year,"" Poon added.
Last month, Hong Kong authorities refused to renew a work visa for the Asia news editor of the Financial Times, soon after he hosted a talk by an independence activist at the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC).
""The incident might make other dissidents and artists rethink whether it's safe for them to do their work in Hong Kong as they may also face similar situation in future,"" Poon added.
Tom Grundy, the editor of Hong Kong Free Press, declined to give specifics as to the nature of the threats.

SOFIA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel on Friday condemned the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, but said cooperating with Riyadh against Iran was a greater priority.
In his first public reaction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Khashoggi's death, which has caused global outrage, was ""horrendous"" and must be dealt with.
""Yet at the same time I say that it's very important for the stability of the world, for the region and of the world, that Saudi Arabia remain stable,"" Netanyahu said. ""I think that a way must be found to achieve both goals. Because I think that the larger problem is Iran.""
He spoke to reporters after a meeting in the Bulgarian city of Varna with the leaders of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Serbia.
The Saudi government initially denied Khashoggi had been killed, then that he had died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"", before the kingdom's public prosecutor last week said the attack had been premeditated.
Earlier, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz had said Khashoggi's killing was outweighed by the existential threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, and that ""Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, are our allies in recent years against the spread of Iran and against the Iranian nuclear threat"".
Iran denies that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons.
The Netanyahu government has reported semi-official Israel-Saudi contacts - never confirmed, and sometimes denied, by Riyadh - since 2014.
Netanyahu made a surprise visit last week to Oman, whose foreign minister then told Gulf neighbors that Israel should be accepted in the region. Other Israeli delegates this week visited the United Arab Emirates.
The Trump administration, which has brought U.S. policy sharply in line with Israel's, has also sought closer relations with Saudi Arabia.

U.S. envoys see Riyadh and other Gulf powers as possible partners in a broad peace deal with Israel that would overtake its long-stalled bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian politician who resigned from the government last month after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual harassment, said on Friday he had a consensual relationship with a New York-based journalist who has accused him of raping her.
Pallavi Gogoi, chief business editor at National Public Radio, wrote in a Washington Post column on Thursday that the former junior foreign minister, M.J. Akbar, ""ripped off my clothes and raped me"" in a hotel room in India 23 years ago.
At the time, she and Akbar worked for the same newspaper. She said after the attack, Akbar had continued to ""defile me sexually, verbally, emotionally"" for months.
Akbar has been one of the highest-profile targets of a growing #MeToo movement in India. 
The movement began in the United States more than a year ago but only gained traction in India in recent weeks.
In a statement to Reuters partner Asian News International (ANI), Akbar said the accusation of rape and violence were false.
""Somewhere around 1994, Ms. Pallavi Gogoi and I entered into a consensual relationship that spanned several months,"" Akbar said. 
""This relationship gave rise to talk and would later cause significant strife in my home life as well. This consensual relationship ended, perhaps not on the best note.""
Gogoi said in the Washington Post that she decided to write about the attack after seeing that several journalists had recently gone public about alleged sexual harassment by Akbar years ago. 
Akbar has denied those allegations and filed a criminal defamation suit against one of the accusers.
Gogoi wrote that her career had initially gone well at the Asian Age daily that Akbar edited. She became editor of the op-ed page at the age of 23, a year after joining the paper.
""But I would soon pay a very big price for doing a job I loved,"" said Gogoi, who was born in India and is now a U.S. citizen.
Gogoi did not immediately respond to emails seeking further comment.
Akbar's wife, Mallika Akbar, also issued a statement to ANI in which she said Gogoi caused ""unhappiness and discord in our home"" through her involvement with her husband.
""I learned of her and my husband's involvement through her late night phone calls and her public display of affection in my presence,"" Mallika said. 
""In her flaunting the relationship, she caused anguish and hurt to my entire family.""
Several men in India's entertainment, media and political worlds have been accused of offences ranging from harassment to rape over the past two months.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has formed a group of four cabinet ministers to suggest steps to address sexual harassment at work.

MIAMI, Fla. (Reuters) - The 56-year-old Florida man accused of mailing 15 pipe bomb packages to high-profile critics of President Donald Trump will appear at a pretrial detention hearing in Miami on Friday morning.
Cesar Sayoc, a former male stripper, pizza delivery driver and DJ who lived in a white van festooned with right-wing political images supporting Trump and lambasting his critics, will appear before a federal magistrate.
Sayoc faces five charges and a maximum penalty of 48 years in prison for bombs sent to targets including former President Barack Obama, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, other prominent political figures and CNN.
Prosecutors said more charges were likely.
Investigators said they had evidence that Sayoc began planning his attacks in July.
If presiding U.S. Magistrate Edwin Torres agrees with prosecutors from the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, Sayoc will not be allowed bail on Friday and after the hearing would be transferred to New York to face charges.
The pipe bomb story dominated U.S. news for much of last week, ending when federal agents arrested Sayoc in the parking lot of an auto parts store in a Fort Lauderdale suburb.
The hearing comes during the closing days of highly charged political campaigns across the country leading up to Nov. 6 U.S. midterm elections. The result will determine the balance of power in Congress, currently controlled by Trump's Republican Party.
Sayoc was arrested days after the first of the pipe bombs inside padded manila envelopes was discovered in the mailbox of billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros north of New York City.
No one has been injured, but investigators with the FBI have said that at least some of the pipe bombs could have caused great harm. All of the bombs were sent through the U.S. Postal Service.

""The evidence of the defendant's terror campaign is still being collected but is already overwhelming,"" wrote Geoffrey Berman, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a letter to Torres dated Tuesday.

But the State Attorney - a separate government-appointed body also prosecuting in the case - said rebellion charges should be dropped in favor of the lesser offence of sedition and that it would seek maximum sentences of 12 years.
Madrid imposed direct rule on the wealthy northeastern region in October 2017 after it declared its independence on the basis of a referendum that Spanish courts ruled was unconstitutional. 
The nine politicians were jailed without bail for their role in that campaign and remain in custody pending trail.
The prosecutor is also seeking lesser charges for another nine others accused of involvement in the campaign who have not been jailed ahead of the trial. 
The prosecutor sought 25 years in jail for Oriol Junqueras, the leader of pro-Catalan-independence party ERC, it said in a statement. 
It recommended sentences of up to 17 years on the same charges for the other eight Catalan politicians. 
The leaders' defense team must present its case in the next few weeks and the trial is expected to begin in January. 

There was no immediate comment from the Catalan regional government. Its head Quim Torra will address the media on Friday afternoon.

The attacks came days after Ivy League Cornell University pulled the plug on cooperation with Renmin University in Beijing after students, also affiliated with their on-campus Marxist society, were punished for supporting labor rights in China.
Despite espousing Marxism as one of its leading ideologies, China's ruling Communist Party opposes any form of activism or organization that has the potential to slip beyond its control. 
Several Marxist university societies struggled to re-register this year on campus, students say, and activists believe authorities are worried about students using the groups for social activism.
Yang Kai and Zhu Shunqing, both members of the unofficial student Marxist group at Nanjing University, were among the leaders of protests on campus which drew a crowd of more than 100 people, according to video footage.
Yang, a fourth-year software engineering major at Nanjing in eastern China, was shoved and dragged on the ground before being bundled away by unidentified men, according to a classmate and fellow member of Nanjing's Marxist student society who requested anonymity.
He spent just over four hours in police detention, the person said.
Zhu was assaulted by plainclothes police on campus on Thursday, said the student. On Friday, Zhu was grabbed, cursed at and forcibly taken from campus by relatives as university administrators looked on. Zhu's current whereabouts were unknown, the classmate said.
Chinese authorities have been known to pressure relatives of students involved in demonstrations or social activism to get them to stop, students say.
""Today at midday as Zhu Shunqing was being kidnapped by his relatives, the heads of both the student welfare department and the media and communications department just stood by and watched,"" said the classmate.
""They didn't do anything to stop his relatives from pushing and shoving him and taking him away.""
Neither Zhu nor Yang could be reached for comment. Nanjing's on-campus security department released a notice late on Thursday on the student portal stating the university had reported the protests to the police. The police station in Nanjing refused to comment by phone.
Around 50 students from across China including students from both Nanjing and Renmin went to southern China in August to protest against the treatment of factory workers.
In late August, police in riot gear stormed an apartment in Huizhou where the students were staying while they supported factory workers at Jasic International seeking to form a union.

LAHORE/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan suspended mobile phone networks in major cities on Friday and many schools were closed as Islamist groups protested for a third day against the acquittal of a Christian woman facing the death penalty for blasphemy.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the conviction of Asia Bibi, a mother of five, and ordered her freed. She had been living on death row since 2010 after being convicted under Pakistan's tough blasphemy laws.
The case outraged Christians worldwide and has been a source of division within Pakistan, where two politicians who sought to help Bibi were assassinated.
The Supreme Court decision enraged hardline Islamists, in particular members of a group called the Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP), who have taken to the streets to call for the death of the judges who made the decision and the ouster of the government.
Authorities, including members of the main military security agency, held negotiations with the leader of the group late on Thursday but they came to no agreement, the TLP leader, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, said.
The spokesman for the military said the armed forces hoped the ""matter is resolved without the disruption of peace"".
""Both sides should talk amongst themselves, and we should not reach the stage where this matter comes under the ambit of the armed forces,"" he told state-run PTV channel. 
On Friday, telephone networks were down in the capital, Islamabad, and the eastern city of Lahore, where pockets of TLP protesters blocked main roads.
""All services have been shut down by the government,” said a customer service representative at one of Pakistan's main mobile phone companies, while declining to elaborate.
Authorities in Pakistan often shut down mobile phone networks in the hope of distrusting the organization of protests.
Schools across the most populous province of Punjab were closed.
In the commercial hub of Karachi in the south, normally bustling markets were shuttered. 
A Reuters photographer saw about 100 protesters using stones, pieces of wood and motor-bikes to create a barricade across one main road.
Bibi's whereabouts were not known on Friday. Her family has been in hiding this week.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Erdogan adviser said Khashoggi's body was dismembered and dissolved: newspaper,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An adviser to Turkey's president has said the team that killed prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul cut up his body in order to dissolve for easier disposal, the newspaper Hurriyet reported on Friday.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul exactly one month go on Oct. 2.
The Saudi government initially insisted Khashoggi had left the consulate, later saying he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". Last week, the kingdom's public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb said the attack was premeditated.
Istanbul chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said this week that Khashoggi was suffocated as soon as he entered the consulate, and his body was then cut up and disposed of.
Turkey has demanded that Saudi authorities tell them where the body is.
But Yasin Aktay, who advises President Tayyip Erdogan and was a friend of Khashoggi's, told Hurriyet newspaper that the corpse was disposed of by dismembering and dissolving it.
""According to the latest information we have, the reason they dismembered his body is to dissolve it easier.""
This was the first time this detail has been mentioned. There was no immediate comment on the report from Turkish officials.
The kingdom has faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of Khashoggi, upending the young crown prince's image as a reformer on the international stage.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said Saudi authorities staged the ""worst cover-up ever"" but has also made more conciliatory remarks that highlight Riyadh's role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well as a purchaser of U.S. arms.
On Thursday, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters Khashoggi's remains should be located and returned to his family for a burial as soon as possible.
Khashoggi had entered the consulate to get some papers he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz, who waited for him outside for hours before she alerted Turkish authorities.
""No matter how long I waited, the joyful Jamal did not return. All that came was news of his death,"" Cengiz wrote in an op-ed widely published on Friday.
Cengiz praised Turkey's investigation efforts and called on the United States to lead the way to bring perpetrators to justice.
""With this tragedy, the Trump administration has taken a position that is devoid of moral foundation,"" she wrote.
""But we will continue to push the Trump administration to help find justice for Jamal. There will be no cover-up.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Jumpei Yasuda, a Japanese journalist held by militants in Syria for more than three years, said on Friday he told his captors to deafen him if they suspected he was eavesdropping on their conversations.
Yasuda, 44, said it was one of the darkest moments before his release last month, ending what he called 40 months of physical and psychological ""hell"". 
""I told them to burst my eardrums and destroy my ears if they don't like to be heard so much,"" the freelance journalist said at the first news conference since his return on Oct 25.
Wearing a black suit and dark blue necktie, and with his greying beard trimmed short, Yasuda bowed in front of reporters and rows of television cameras before taking questions.
Yasuda said he was fully accountable for his actions.
""I would like to offer my apology and express my gratitude to those who worked for my release, and who were worried about me,"" he said in a somber voice. 
""I am very sorry that my conduct has had the Japanese government involved in this matter,"" Yasuda added.
He was captured almost immediately after entering Syria on foot from Turkey in June 2015, and moved from one detention facility to another routinely over the 40 months.
At one location, he was not allowed to make any noise -- even the sound of breathing through his nose or cracking of his knuckles -- making it virtually impossible for him to move.
""In their logic, my making noise seemed to mean I moved to eavesdrop on what's going on. So, whenever I made noise, they started doing things like torture (other hostages) and turn off the light,"" Yasuda said. 
At one point, he didn't eat for 20 days in an effort to avoid any movement. It left him thin and nauseated.
He later converted to Islam because it allowed him more freedom of movement. 
""As a Muslim, you must pray five times a day. As I could move only twice a day during meal time, conversion to Islam meant five additional occasions for me to move,"" he said.
RECKLESS OR COURAGEOUS?
It was not the first time Yasuda had been detained in the Middle East. He was held in Iraq in 2004 and criticised at home for drawing the government into negotiations for his release. 
Yasuda's latest release, which made front-page news in Japan, rekindled debate about reporting from war zones that some see as reckless adventure and others as courageous journalism.
""My own conduct caused trouble for the Japanese government as well as many people. It is only natural I take criticism,"" Yasuda said.
However, he defended the need for on-the-ground reporting in conflict zones. 
""States kill people in war. Information is absolutely necessary for people to decide if such an act is acceptable,"" Yasuda said. ""Information for that purpose should come not only from the states involved, but from a third party as well."" 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe thanked Qatar and Turkey for their cooperation after Yasuda was released, but Japan's government said it did not pay a ransom.
Japanese media have reported he was held hostage by the Nusra Front, but Yasuda said he was not told the identify of his captors and he had no idea what had triggered his release. 
Asked if he would go back to war reporting, Yasuda said he didn't know.
""I am thinking I should be good to my parents. So, I could be more cautious in the way I conduct my reporting from now on.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China promised to support Pakistan's economy on Friday as new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told of his country's ""very difficult"" economic situation amid a burgeoning financial crisis.
Pakistan's foreign reserves have plunged 42 percent since the start of the year and now stand at about $7.8 billion, or less than two months of import cover.
Last month, Pakistan received a $6 billion rescue package from Saudi Arabia, but officials say it is not enough and the country still plans to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avert a balance of payments crisis.
It would be Pakistan's 13th rescue package from the multilateral lender since the late 1980s.
Meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Khan said he'd come to China to learn.
""My party has only been in power for two months. Unfortunately we have inherited a very difficult economic situation,"" Khan said. 
""Countries go in cycles. They have their high points, they have their low points. Unfortunately, our country is going through a low point at the moment with two very big deficits, a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit. And so we, as I've said, have come to learn.""
Xi told Khan that he highly valued the two country's relations, reaffirming they were ""all-weather"" friends.
""I attach great importance to China-Pakistan relations and am willing to work together with the prime minister to strengthen the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic partnership and build a new era of China-Pakistan destiny,"" Xi said.
Neither man mentioned any economic aid in comments made in front of reporters.
However, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a separate meeting that China would not let Pakistan down.
""The Chinese side will continue to provide support and help to the best of its ability for Pakistan's economic and social development and national construction,"" China's Foreign Ministry cited Wang as saying, without giving details.
The Pakistan prime minister's office said later that Xi had accepted an invitation to visit to the country. It gave no timeframe.
Khan will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday, when the two countries are expected to sign a series of agreements.
Though China is Pakistan's closest ally, Khan's newly elected government has sought to re-think the two countries' signature project, the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which Beijing touts as the flagship infrastructure program in its vast Belt and Road Initiative.
Pakistan has sought to amend CPEC to put greater emphasis on projects that focus on social development, rather than purely on infrastructure.
After visiting Beijing, Khan is set to be a key note speaker at a major import fair in Shanghai, an event being touted by China as an opportunity to show the world the country welcomes foreign companies and their products.

Khan is in China amid unrest at home over the acquittal of a Pakistani Christian woman on death row for blasphemy, which has prompted an ultra-Islamist party to block roads in protest.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",A problem for Ethiopia's leader: the young men who helped him to power,"By Maggie Fick and Tiksa Negeri
WOLISO, Ethiopia (Reuters) - They were tortured for their political beliefs. They saw friends shot dead by security forces. They were forced to cut their hair and give up other cultural traditions. This year, they say, they caused a revolution.
Young men from Ethiopia's Oromo, the country's largest ethnic group, proudly declare ""we won"" when describing their role in the rise of 42-year-old reformer Abiy Ahmed, also an Oromo, to become prime minister.
Across the Oromiya region, many of those young men claiming victory now want Abiy to deliver - and fast. The ""Qeerroo"", an Oromo term meaning ""bachelor"" adopted by politically active young men, are demanding answers. 
Will there be justice for friends who died during strikes and protests over the past three years? Will their rights as Oromos be respected? When will Abiy's pledges of change help their impoverished communities?
Whether Abiy can answer those demands without favoring his home region over the rest of the country will dictate whether the young men remain an asset to him or become a dangerous liability. Before he came to power, the Oromo youths had already demonstrated they could shut down parts of the country with protests and strikes, and that pressure on the ruling EPRDF culminated in the resignation of Abiy's predecessor in February.
Even as they celebrate Abiy, the Oromo youth are still frustrated with life under the EPRDF, a one-time Marxist-Leninist movement which has controlled nearly every aspect of Ethiopians' lives since seizing power 27 years ago. 
Frustration has sometimes turned into violence. In September, Oromo youths were reported by Amnesty International to have carried out deadly mob attacks on other ethnic groups near Addis Ababa. Police said 28 died.
Elsewhere in Oromiya, young men are starting to challenge the state. They want local officials sacked and have booed them out of rallies. 
""I appreciate Abiy for the reform he brought, and blame him for not removing those corrupt and evil killers from their positions and bringing them to court,"" said unemployed accountant Dambal Dejene, 26, at a rally in the town of Woliso.
Abiy became prime minister in April after the EPRDF decided reforms were essential for its survival.
His appointment was a small step towards breaking the hold of the Tigrayan elite who have controlled the state since they took power in 1991 and founded the EPRDF as a coalition with other ethnic political parties. 
WHAT DO WE WANT?
Asked what they want from the government, more than a dozen young Oromo men told Reuters:
""Freedom.""
""No more torture.""
""Justice.""
""Economic opportunity. Jobs.""
""End to corruption and unfair land deals.""
""Respect for our culture. Dignity.""
""Democracy.""
""Free and fair elections.""
Abiy announced reforms months ago but these have stalled in part due to a spike in ethnic violence. 
More than one million people have been forced to flee their homes since Abiy took office. In the most serious violence, Oromo communities have clashed with other groups.
Acknowledging a breakdown of the rule of law, the EPRDF said last month: ""Anarchy is witnessed in the country."" In a speech to parliament, Abiy said: ""Lawlessness is the norm these days. It is something that is testing the government."" He has reshuffled his cabinet and formed a ""Ministry of Peace"".
Some young Oromos seem emboldened to settle old ethnic scores, said Felix Horne, Ethiopia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""Since Abiy came to power, things have changed,"" he said. ""The ethno-nationalist narrative is much more dominant than it used to be ... a lot of the young Oromos are not willing to take 'second place',"" Horne said.
""The youth have already shown that they can be very influential. How they choose to be influential is an important question,"" said a senior western diplomat in Addis Ababa. ""Their support, or non-support, for the reform agenda will directly impact how quickly and how well the reform agenda succeeds.""
Abiy's chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for Abiy's political party said changes were needed at the grassroots. 
""Anyone who was slapping you, shouting at you, seeing that face may dissatisfy the people. We feel it,"" said Taye Dendea, public affairs head for the Oromo Democratic Party. 
He requested patience from the youths while the ruling coalition implements change. 
But like many young Oromos, Magarsa Kanaa, a 28-year-old teacher, said he is still very upset at the crimes committed by security forces against his friends.
He named one who was shot dead at a protest last year, and said he and other young men ""are starting a committee to seek justice for him and other guys"". 
Proud to be wearing his hair in an Afro, he spoke bitterly of how the government had not allowed Oromos to practice their culture. Men his age, he explained, like to wear their hair in the shape of the ""Odaa"", the Oromo word for the sycamore tree that is significant as the site of rituals and meetings to resolve disputes.
Instead, he said: ""We were forced to cut our hair."" 
""OROMO FIRST""
Activist Jawar Mohammed promotes an ""Oromo first"" ideology. 
The 32-year-old with 1.4 million Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) followers returned to Ethiopia in August from the United States. He told Reuters that although he used social media to coordinate Oromo youths in strikes and protests, he also ""built a solid ground network"" in every town in the region. Jawar is the movement's hero.
""Jawar Mohammed is my pride,"" said Dambal, the accountant. ""He took the Oromo struggle to the next level. We were lacking someone to lead the youth ... he made us line up all together all over Oromiya and win.""
Interviewed in a villa in Addis Ababa surrounded by bodyguards provided by the government, Jawar justified Oromo nationalism: ""When the state particularly represses an ethnic identity, you are forced to defend it.""
But his ""Qeerroo"" are disciplined, he said, and will stick to non-violent resistance.
At a rally in the town of Kemise, north of the capital, Jawar told thousands of young men chanting ""Qeerroo's Father is here!"": ""Obey Abiy. Don't be emotional in order to help the reforms."" But on social media, his language is often less restrained.
Speaking to Reuters, he argued that Ethiopia is experiencing a ""promising and terrifying"" moment where the ""power of the people"" is rising and the state's legitimacy has collapsed.
""People power"" - particularly from the Oromo - is a strength for Abiy, but rebuilding and controlling the state is an urgent problem, Jawar said. 
""If (Abiy) doesn't move quickly to take full control of state power, so that he can use it to answer some of the demands of the youth ... these people will turn against him.
""They think this is their government ... So it's just a ticking time bomb. We've gotta move fast,"" he said, referencing elections that are due in 2020. He said Abiy ""has good intentions, but he has no plan, no deadline.""
Older Oromo politicians agree.
""The youth moved the struggle we have been undertaking for the last 50 years one step forward,"" said Merera Gudina, 62, leader of the Oromo Federalist Congress. ""The PM makes a lot of promises. If he cannot walk his talk, then he'll face the youth, definitely.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen killed a leader of India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jammu and Kashmir state late on Thursday, prompting authorities to impose a curfew in the area.
Anil Parihar, 53, state secretary of the BJP, and his brother, Ajit, were shot dead in the predominantly Muslim town of Kishtwar, while they headed home after shutting their shop, police said.
Police are investigating whether it was a militant attack or a criminal act, a senior police officer said.
Anil Parihar was an influential leader in the region. He was considered a moderate and had a sizeable support base, even among Muslims, media reported.
Indian Kashmir, its only Muslim-majority state, has been beset by a 29-year-old insurgency.
India accuses Pakistan for sheltering anti-India militants but Pakistan denies that. Pakistan, which like India, claims the whole of Kashmir, calls for talks to decide the region's future.
The BJP leader in the state had two bodyguards but they were not with him at the time of the attack, said Kishtwar's senior police official, Rajinder Gupta.
Kashmir is under direct rule by the federal government, which gives the BJP a free hand to control it ahead of a general election that must be called early next year.
Federal home minister Rajnath Singh said he was shocked and pained by the killing of the brothers. 
""Police will leave no stone unturned to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Singh said on Twitter.
Kashmir has been at the heart of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan, which have gone to war over it twice since independence from Britain in 1947.

The monthly survey in La Repubblica newspaper showed 58 percent considered Salvini the leader, while 16 percent picked Conte and 14 percent chose Luigi Di Maio, who heads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Salvini and Di Maio are deputy prime ministers in Conte's coalition government, which took office in June and which the Demos poll found that 58 percent of respondents support.
Salvini enjoys a massive presence on social media, radio and television, employing them all to push his party's populist, anti-immigrant policies.
His has also been the most uncompromising voice of authority emerging from Rome during a standoff with Brussels over a 2019 budget that EU authorities have said violates the bloc's rules and told the government to rework.
Salvini also took over from Conte as Italy's most popular politician, polling a 60 percent approval rating in October, the same as in September. The prime minister's rating fell to 59 percent from 61 percent.
A majority of opposition party voters said they considered Salvini the real leader of the government, including 70 percent of the Democratic Party and 51 percent of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
Even among 5-Star members, 35 percent named Salvini as the real leader, just two percent fewer than Di Maio.
Overall confidence in the government edged down from 62 percent in September.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - The European Union will consider stripping Sri Lanka of its duty-free access if it backs off commitments on rights, the EU ambassador said, amid worries stoked by the president's replacing of the elected premier by a wartime nationalist.
The European Union is worried the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa, as prime minister, could derail halting progress made toward national reconciliation following a war with ethnic minority Tamil separatists that killed tens of thousands, many during the final stages under his watch as president. 
""The government got GSP on the basis of certain commitments, if these commitments are not met, then we would consider withdrawal,"" EU ambassador to Sri Lanka, Tung-Lai Margue, told Reuters on Thursday.
Margue was referring to Generalised System of Preferences Plus status, under which Sri Lanka’s top exports of garments and fish get lucrative concessions in the world's largest single market.
Margue was among a group of diplomats who met President Maithripala Sirisena this week for a briefing on the crisis sparked by his sacking of the prime minister.
The EU provides the trade concessions to developing countries, while it also monitors certain conditions including human rights.
Sri Lanka promised the EU in 2016 it would work toward reconciliation with Tamils, who mostly live in the north and east of the predominantly Buddhist nation, through greater political and economic autonomy.
Sri Lanka also pledged to provide justice and reparations to victims of human rights violations committed during the 26-year civil war, many of which were blamed on Rajapaksa and his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was his defense secretary. 
Both say the military only targeted insurgents, not civilians.
Margue said some progress had been made toward human rights by the administration of sacked prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, such as the establishment of a missing persons' office to trace the thousands of Tamils and minority Muslims who disappeared during the war.
But more needed to be done and there were questions about whether a government led by Rajapaksa would pursue justice for victims as vigorously. 
""I don't know what his policy on reconciliation would be like. I have fears it won't be the one we agreed on,"" Margue said.
Rajapaksa was not available for comment, but his son Namal Rajapaksa, who is a member of parliament, defended the family's record and cautioned against pre-judging policies of the administration. 
""Reconciliation has, and always will be, a focal area for us. If there is concern that GSP will need to be withdrawn, these concerns are unfounded and presupposed in error,"" he said. 
Soon after he was appointed prime minister on Oct. 26 Rajapaksa also struck a conciliatory note, saying he would ""eschew the politics of hate"", protect human rights and the independence of the judiciary and establish law and order"".
STRONGEST WARNING 
Sirisena suspended parliament last week, after he sacked Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe has denounced his removal as illegal.
Both the United States and the EU have called for parliament to be convened at the earliest to let lawmakers decide who should be prime minister of the country of 21 million people. 
On Friday, the speaker of parliament said Sirisena had agreed to summon a session on Wednesday next week.
The EU warning on trade is the strongest yet from Western powers which, along with India, the island's nearest neighbor, have urged Sirisena to abide by the constitution.
On the other hand, China, which invested billions of dollars during Rajapaksa's presidency, has called for non-interference and said Sri Lanka could tackle its own problems.
Diplomats said trade was key to Sri Lanka's $87 billion economy and the EU is its biggest export market, accounting for nearly a third of exports in 2017. 
Sri Lanka regained the GSP plus preferential treatment in 2017. Its exports to the EU have since jumped 18 percent, and the financial year was not yet over, Margue said. 
Fish exports had jumped 100 percent, he said.
China, in contrast, has faced criticism for its big projects that have left Sri Lanka so much in debt it had to hand over control of a port to China. 
""It's better to do trade than have friends, friends who give loans,"" said a Western diplomat referring to China's lending.

Sri Lanka's garment industry is its second-biggest hard currency earner, after remittances, worth about $5 billion a year, with goods supplied to top brands including Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Marks & Spencer.

London's Metropolitan Police said its chief, Commissioner Cressida Dick, was handed a folder of paperwork in September including alleged evidence of anti-Semitic hate crimes.
""The contents have been examined by specialist officers. A criminal investigation has commenced into some of the allegations within the documentation,"" a police statement said.
Dick told BBC Radio that the allegations related to an online crime.
Labour said that it had ""a robust system for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour party rules by its members.""
""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way,"" a Labour statement said.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has faced criticism for his handling of complaints about anti-Semitism in his party. Earlier this year, he acknowledged anti-Semitism had surfaced within the party and apologized for the pain this had caused.
Jewish leaders have described his response as a ""disappointing missed opportunity"".
Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the allegations were ""thoroughly depressing, although sadly I'm not surprised.""
""If people have committed hate crimes, then they need to be dealt with by the full force of the law. There's no role for them in the Labour party,"" he told BBC Radio. 
A report in February by the Community Security Trust, a charity that provides security advice to the country's Jewish communities, said anti-Jewish sentiment was becoming more commonplace in Britain.

It said publicity about alleged anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party had been partly to blame for a record number of anti-Semitic incidents in Britain last year.

MYITKYINA, Myanmar (Reuters) - Asked what Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has changed since becoming Myanmar's leader two years ago, most residents of Kachin state in the far north say the roads: new tarmac smoothes the path for cars, motorbikes and campaign trucks ahead of a by-election set for Saturday.
But beyond the city limits, near-perpetual civil war rumbles on. Many here say the administration's inability to tackle the country's toughest problems, including continued ethnic fighting, has soured the mood among voters ahead of polls this weekend being closely watched as a barometer on Suu Kyi's government and the future of Myanmar's democratic transition.
Suu Kyi swept to power pledging that a peace process to end Myanmar's myriad ethnic conflicts was her top priority. But since then Kachin has seen some of the most intense fighting between the military and ethnic rebels since a ceasefire broke down seven years ago, with thousands of people displaced. 
""We voted for her and she won and came into power,"" said 40-year-old Htu Lun, who was driven from her home in 2011 and has since lived in one of dozens of displacement camps in Myitkyina, the state capital.
""But in reality, nothing has changed. Now the election time has come again, we will choose the party that serves our interest.""
Thirteen seats in the upper and lower houses of parliament and regional assemblies across Myanmar are being contested in Saturday's by-elections. Eleven fell vacant when legislators died in office, a reflection of Myanmar's aging political leadership, while one MP, Win Myint, became president.
The election of the NLD in late 2015 brought an end to half-a-century of junta rule but the new government, which must still share power with the military, is now facing multiple crises.
The army has been accused by U.N. rights investigators of acting with ""genocidal intent"" against Rohingya Muslims in a crackdown in western Rakhine state last year. Meanwhile, the economy has slowed and peace talks with rebels from Kachin and other ethnic minority areas have faltered.
Suu Kyi's administration has no control over the army, but has denied almost all the allegations against troops in Rakhine. NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters economic progress has stalled but not reversed, and the expectations of the people were too high. Making peace is the government's top priority, he said, but all parties, including ethnic leaders and the military, have to co-operate.
While several of the seats up for grabs on Saturday lie in the country's Buddhist heartland and are likely to remain under NLD control, representatives of the ruling party have voiced jitters about areas where they face stiff competition from ascendant ethnic parties.
Low turnout in some places could skew the result against the NLD, analysts said. Though Myitkyina is one of the most hotly contested seats, several people there whom Reuters spoke to were not aware a by-election was taking place, while others said they did not plan to vote.
""This time we have to struggle for victory – it will not be easy,"" said Aung Shin, a spokesman for the NLD.
Late last month, Suu Kyi flew to Myitkyina, visiting displacement camps and a drug rehabilitation center funded by her charity. 
Yan Hkawn, the party's candidate in the city, said the vote would likely be split. 
Suu Kyi is trying to solve all the country's problems, she said. ""It's not easy to achieve that by walking alone, by herself,"" she said.
ETHNIC ALLIANCE
While supporters say the government needs more time to effect change, disillusionment runs high in ethnic areas, where residents harbor longstanding distrust of the Bamar Buddhist majority.
""Daw Suu Kyi promised us, 'We will change everything, everyone will get equal rights',” said Win Aung, an 80-year-old Muslim leader, sitting by the side of the road after watching campaign trucks bearing her face pass by. 
But religious discrimination against Christians – the majority in Kachin state – and Muslims has continued, he said.
""We need permission when we are planning a religious ceremony,"" he said. ""Still now, we never get permission.""
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the government was working to bridge religious and racial divides.
""The person who understands Myanmar politics will know that a huge number of religious fanatics exist,"" he told Reuters. ""We can't change that in a short time."" 
As well as more than 700,000 Rohingya forced to flee Rakhine for Bangladesh after the military crackdown in 2017, more than 68,000 people have been internally displaced by fighting in Kachin and northern Shan state since January 2017, according to the U.N. Organisation for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
In an October report published by the independent election monitoring group PACE, a quarter of respondents said ethnic conflict had worsened since the NLD took power. 
Six of the seats being contested on Saturday are in ethnic areas, and analysts are watching the result for signs of what might happen when the country goes to the polls in the next general election in 2020.
In recent months, minority parties that previously competed against one another have merged to run under one banner, forming alliances that could pose a strong challenge to the NLD, which currently holds a comfortable majority in parliament despite the constitution reserving 25 percent of seats for the military. 
""We can see that the ethnic movement in the election is quite powerful,"" said Yangon-based analyst Maung Maung Soe. ""If there is no landslide win like in 2015, it will be difficult for the NLD to form a government by itself. We have to prepare for an alliance or to combine with the ethnic parties.""
In Kachin, four ethnic parties are competing under the banner of the Kachin Democratic Party, after a recent merger that resulted from five years of negotiation, according to its leader, Gumgrawng Awng Hkam.
The former activist, who spent years in exile under the junta, was once a strident supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi. He said her government had failed to be transparent in its response to allegations of human rights abuses against the Rohingya in Rakhine or express sympathy for the suffering of ethnic Kachin.
""She dropped the hand of ethnic and democratic allies and took the hand of the military,"" he said, sitting in the party headquarters in Myitkyina.
His vision is for a grand alliance of ethnic parties that could mount a strong challenge to the NLD in 2020.
""We cannot form a government by ethnic forces by ourselves,"" he said. ""We will make an alliance with the party which is harmonious for us ... There are no constant enemies, no constant friends in politics.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Suspected Indian militants shot dead five Bengali-speaking Hindu men in a sensitive border state late on Thursday, police said, as tension grows over a controversial citizenship test to identify illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh.
India's northeastern state of Assam, home to 33 million people, has suffered years of violence as residents, including tribal groups, have clashed with suspected Hindu and Muslim settlers they accuse of plundering resources and grabbing jobs.
The state's draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) released in July excluded 4 million mostly Bengali-speaking Muslims and Hindus.
On Friday, police said the five men killed were Indian citizens who had been shot one by one after being taken to a low-lying area by a road in Assam's district of Tinsukia.
One young man, picked up by a group of men in army fatigues but presumably left for dead when he passed out at the start of the shooting, said he was lucky to be alive.
""I woke up minutes later and saw the five bodies lying in ditches,"" Sahadeb Namashudra, also a Bengali Hindu, told reporters at the incident site. ""They were in army fatigues and carrying long guns.""
Police have not yet made any arrests in the investigation, said a spokesman, Deepak Deka. The situation was tense in Tinsukia because of a 12-hour shutdown called by Bengali associations there, he added.
The government has promised strong action against the perpetrators.
The United Liberation Front of Asom (Independent), which has in the past championed the separation of tea and oil-rich Assam from India and is now trying to make a comeback there, denied responsibility for the killings in a statement. No other group has claimed responsibility.
Work on the NRC accelerated under the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which wants to give all Hindus citizenship, infuriating many Assamese, who want all illegal immigrants expelled.
India, which does not have a deportation pact with Bangladesh, has said it will decide on the fate of those eventually deemed foreigners in consultation with the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the registration process.
Mamata Banerjee, a staunch Modi critic whose party rules India's eastern state of West Bengal, said it would hold rallies all over the Bengali-majority state to protest against the killings in neighboring Assam.
The state will shelter Assam's Bengali-speaking people if the NRC process deems them stateless, she added.
""Terrible news coming out of Assam,"" Banerjee, the state's chief minister, told reporters. ""We strongly condemn the brutal attack in Tinsukia and the killings. Is this the outcome of NRC development?""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet approved draft legislation on Friday to open the door to more overseas blue-collar workers in sectors grappling with labor shortages, a controversial policy shift in immigration-shy Japan. 
Japan's immigration debate is heating up even as U.S. President Donald Trump puts the topic front and center for next week's Congressional mid-term elections.
Immigration has long been taboo as many Japanese prize ethnic homogeneity, but the reality of an aging, shrinking population is challenging such views. 
Despite misgivings in Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), parliament is likely to adopt the revisions in the face of intense pressure from businesses battling the tightest labor market in decades, although opposition parties could delay.
The revised law would create two new visa categories for foreigners in sectors with labor shortages. While not spelt out, they are expected to be more than a dozen, from farming and construction to hotels and nursing care.
Justice Minister Takashi Yamashita on Thursday ruled out a numerical cap, but media said 500,000 blue-collar workers could be allowed in over time, up 40 percent from the 1.28 million foreign workers now forming about 2 percent of the workforce. 
Workers in the first visa category must have a certain level of skills and Japanese language ability. They would not be allowed to bring family members for a stay of up to five years.
But those with higher skills, in the second category, could bring family and eventually get residency.
Japan has grown more accepting of foreign labor but the focus has been on professionals and the highly skilled.
For blue-collar workers, employers mostly rely on a ""technical trainees"" system and foreign students working part-time, loopholes critics say are abused.
""Today it is quite difficult for foreigners to get ... jobs as security guards,"" said Shigeki Yawata, security manager at security firm Executive Protection Inc, which has employed non-Japanese for more than a dozen years. ""The Olympic Games are coming up and the government is working on inbound tourism, so we would like to have more foreigners, too.""
LDP lawmakers signed off on the bill after heated party debate. Many expressed concerns about crime and a negative effect on wages. Opposition politicians accuse the government of undue haste without protecting foreign workers' rights.
""The LDP decision was ... pushed by businesses with a serious shortage of workers,"" said Toshihiro Menju, managing director of the Japan Center for International Exchange, a think tank.
Abe has said the changes do not constitute an ""immigration policy"", out of an apparent desire not to upset his conservative backers. Many experts differ.
""I think this is a de facto shift to an immigration policy,"" Hidenori Sakanaka, a former head of the Tokyo Immigration Bureau, told Reuters.
The tiny nationalist ""Japan First Party"" has protested against the changes for reasons such as fears foreigners would inflate welfare rolls and crime rates, it says on its website.
A recent survey by the Yomiuri newspaper, however, showed 51 percent of Japanese voters favored letting in more unskilled foreign workers and about 43 percent backed recognizing ""immigration"" - about the same percentage as those opposed.
""I think it’s a good thing as long as there is a support system for the foreigners,"" said retiree Yoshio Sai. ""I wish they could make more work opportunities for us old people too.""

The violence broke out days after renewed U.S. calls for a ceasefire in the three-and-half-year war that the Saudi-backed government suggested it was ready to support.
Houthi forces were using the airbase in the capital to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks, a coalition spokesman told Saudi state al-Ekhbaria TV on Friday. 
Flights and international aid efforts were not affected, Colonel Turki al-Malki said. 
Al-Masirah TV, which is controlled by the Houthis, said more than 30 air strikes targeted al-Dulaimi Air Base in Sanaa and the surrounding areas.
In the port of Hodeidah, fighting broke out early on Friday in a southern district, residents and military sources said. 
The coalition had massed thousands of troops near the city on Wednesday, in a move to pressure the Iran-aligned Houthis to return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
The sources in Hodeidah said fighting was heard in areas near the airport and the university, and Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters were spotted in the sky. 
Forces loyal to the Saudi-backed government have said coalition strikes were intensified on Thursday night on Houthi bases near the eastern entrance to the port city, which is a gateway to the capital, and in its southern part. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting since March 2015 against the Houthis, who drove the country's internationally recognized government into exile in 2014.
The Houthis control much of north Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
The war has devastated the country's infrastructure and driven much of its population to the brink of famine.

On Oct. 21 a train in Yilan in Taiwan's northeast came off the rails on a curve while traveling at almost 149 kmh (87 mph), nearly twice the speed limit, the head of a Taiwan government investigation team has said.
Eighteen people were killed and 187 injured in the island's worst rail crash in decades.
Naoki Sato, an official at Nippon Sharyo, told Reuters on Friday that the company's investigation into the crash had discovered a flaw in the blueprint for wiring the connection of the train's automatic train protection (ATP) safety system to the control station.
There is no problem with the safety system itself, which is designed to automatically apply the brakes when the train exceeds the speed limit, the official said. 
Nippon Sharyo's Sato said the flawed blueprint was used in 19 train sets built for Taiwan, including the one that crashed. He said any decision on whether to fix the wiring was up to the Taiwan rail authority, which owns the trains.
The Taiwan Railways Administration said in a statement it has asked Nippon Sharyo for a more detailed explanation. It did not elaborate. It was not immediately clear whether the remaining 18 trains were currently in operation.
The train's driver, You Zhen-zhong, told a court last month he switched off the speed-control system to boost the train's power when it slowed down on an earlier stretch of the journey, according to a Taiwan court spokesman, citing his bail hearing.
The public defender for You said he knew he had to turn the protection system back on but failed to do so because he was busy communicating with other coordinators about a separate problem with the train's speed.

Shares in train manufacturer Nippon Sharyo Ltd plunged by the daily limit in Tokyo, losing 17 percent to a near-2-1/2-year low, after news of the design flaw.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Fujimori family has been here before.
When Alberto Fujimori fled graft allegations and resigned Peru's presidency by fax from Japan in 2000, many thought the family name and the right-wing populist brand he built during his decade in power were ruined.
But his daughter Keiko, a Columbia Business School graduate who once served as his first lady, soon stepped in. 
As he languished in prison for human rights crimes after being extradited from Chile, Keiko Fujimori turned his divisive legacy into Peru's best organized political party. She once tapped former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a campaign adviser, and twice nearly became president, in the 2011 and 2016 elections.
But this year the ""New Fujimorism"" movement that Keiko spent more than a decade carefully cultivating has itself sunk into scandal, putting one of Latin America's best known political dynasties back on life support.
Peruvians have spent the past week watching Keiko trying to defend herself in court from allegations she used her 2011 presidential race to secure $1.2 million in kickbacks from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
Prosecutors have also sought to arrest 20 of her advisers and associates in the same money laundering probe.
This week a judge ordered Keiko, now 43, to spend up to three years in jail pending trial, crippling her once-powerful Popular Force party and depriving Peru's largest conservative base of a viable leader. No one has been groomed to succeed her. 
Keiko denies wrongdoing and has blamed her legal woes on ""political persecution"" that she has vowed to fight.
COMEBACK COULD BE TOUGH
""This is not the first time Fujimorism has been in a terminal crisis,"" said political scientist Carlos Melendez. ""It's not the first time Fujimorism has had a leader in prison. It's not the first time it cries political persecution. It's not the first time it loses public support."" 
""The difference is Alberto had something to show for it,"" Melendez added. ""Keiko has nothing.""
Alberto Fujimori's supporters credit him with quashing a leftist insurgency and pulling Peru from economic ruin, while ignoring or denying the graft, authoritarianism, and extra-judicial killings by his government.
Keiko, however, is a one-term lawmaker whom critics say squandered a congressional majority on what they consider a personal vendetta against former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who narrowly beat her in 2016 and resigned in March to avoid impeachment.
Many among Peru's conservative elites have viewed the Fujimori family as the only political force popular enough to keep the hard left from reaching power in the world's No.2 copper producer.
But less than three years from the next general elections in 2021, it is anyone's guess who could lead a family revival.
Alberto Fujimori, now an ailing 80-year-old, has spent the past month in the hospital, where he has avoided being sent back to prison after a judged annulled a pardon he secured last year.
Keiko's younger brother Kenji Fujimori, 38, a lawmaker who once talked of running for president, has withdrawn from politics since his sister's party disowned him in March after it published embarrassing videos of him lobbying lawmakers to keep Kuczynski in power.
Her two other siblings, Sachi and Hiro, have shown no interest in politics.
Keiko might get out early on an appeal before 2021. But the bigger hurdle she will face in staging a comeback is changing the increasingly widespread view of her as corrupt and authoritarian, an image she inherited from her father that she spent years trying to shake.
""Peru is tired of the Fujimoris,"" said Modesto Guidiche, a 55-year-old doorman in Lima, who like many Peruvians has watched the family's dramas unfold publicly for nearly three decades. ""The daughter's turned out to be just like the father.""
But Keiko's supporters say she has been unfairly blamed for Peru's recent political turmoil and, like her father once did, will continue to take part in politics from prison.

""She's very strong. I'm telling you, this battle is just beginning,"" Keiko's American husband, Mark Vito, told journalists on Wednesday. ""We might suffer as we have been suffering, but we'll never give up.""

Pompeo, in an interview with KMOX radio in St. Louis, said President Donald Trump had made it clear Washington would respond to the killing. He said the administration is ""reviewing putting sanctions on the individuals that we have been able to identify to date that ... were engaged in that murder.""
""It'll take us probably a handful more weeks before we have enough evidence to actually put those sanctions in place, but I think we'll be able to get there,"" Pompeo said.
""We're going to find the fact pattern,"" he said. ""The president said we will demand accountability for those who were involved in the commission of this heinous crime.""
While insisting the United States did not condone Khashoggi's killing, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States had ""deep and long-term strategic relationships"" with Saudi Arabia and ""we intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact.""
Saudi Arabia's former intelligence minister, Prince Turki bin Faisal al Saud, said on Wednesday that the outcry in the United States demonizing Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing threatened to disrupt strategic ties between the two countries.
""We value our strategic relationship with the United States and hope to sustain it. We hope the United States reciprocates in kind,"" Prince Turki, a royal family member, said in remarks at the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, a non-profit advocacy organization.
Khashoggi, who lived in the United States and wrote columns for the Washington Post, went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to collect some documents, but he never reappeared. Riyadh initially denied any role in his disappearance, but under pressure from Turkish authorities it eventually identified 18 suspects in the case.
Saudi Arabia said they will face justice in the kingdom. Ankara has repeatedly called for them to be extradited to Turkey for trial.

Turkey pressed Saudi authorities on Thursday to tell them the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body, which has not been recovered.

Perry will also visit Hungary and the Czech Republic on the trip. He will meet with government officials on topics from nuclear energy to cyber security and coal and liquefied natural gas exports, the Department of Energy said in a release on Thursday. 
The Trump administration is seeking foreign markets for coal as domestic consumption has dropped to the lowest level since 1983 due to closures of coal-fired power plants that are suffering from abundant, cheap supplies of natural gas.
In July, 2017 Centrenergo PJSC, one of the largest power companies in Ukraine, agreed to buy 700,000 tons of U.S. coal. 
Last month, Poland's top natural gas company, PGNiG, finalized the terms of a deal to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from U.S. company Venture Global LNG, as part of a move to cut reliance on Russia. 
Poland has relied on Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for more than half of its gas under a long-term deal that expires in 2022. 
The United States is touting its LNG as more reliable than pipelined gas from Russia, but LNG is more expensive because of the costs of shipping and super-cooling the fuel to the point where it becomes a liquid.

The delegation was led by communications strategist Joel Rosenberg and included former U.S. congresswoman Michele Bachmann, according to an emailed statement by the group, as well as heads of American evangelical organizations, some with ties to Israel.
""It was a historic moment for the Saudi Crown Prince to openly welcome Evangelical Christian leaders to the Palace. We were encouraged by the candor of the two-hour conversation with him today,"" the statement said.
The delegation also met Saudi officials including Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Ambassador to Washington Prince Khalid bin Salman, and secretary-general of the Muslim World League Mohammed al-Issa.
A visit by such prominent non-Muslim leaders, who estimate they represent about 60 million people, is a rare act of religious openness for Saudi Arabia, which hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions.
Some of the figures' support for Israel, which the kingdom does not recognize, is also striking. For instance, Mike Evans, founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Team, describes himself on his website as ""a devout American-Christian Zionist leader"".
Saudi Arabia has maintained for years that normalizing relations with Israel hinges on its withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war - territory Palestinians seek for a future state.
But increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi Arabia and Israel to work together against what they regard as a common Iranian threat.
Prince Mohammed, who in recent years has loosened strict social rules and arrested Saudi clerics deemed extremists, said in April that Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land. A month earlier, Saudi Arabia opened its air space for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel.
Several members of the delegation, which met with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed in the United Arab Emirates earlier in the week, have also advised U.S. President Donald Trump on faith issues.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The pilot of a Lion Air flight from Indonesia's Bali island on Sunday made a radio alert minutes after take-off due to technical problems, but they were overcome and he pushed on to Jakarta. The same jet crashed on another flight hours later, killing all 189 people on board.
Herson, chief of the airport authority for the Bali-Nusa Tenggara area, told Reuters that after the alert the pilot updated the control tower to say that the plane was flying normally and he would not return to the airport as requested.
""The captain himself was confident enough to fly to Jakarta from Denpasar,"" said Herson, who goes by one name, speaking by phone from Bali and referring to the resort island's airport. 
The pilot of another plane that was approaching Bali just after the Lion Air jet had taken off said he was ordered to circle above the airport and listened in to a radio conversation between the Lion Air pilot and air traffic controllers.
""Because of the Pan-Pan call, we were told to hold off, circling the airport in the air,"" said the pilot, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""The Lion plane requested to return back to Bali five minutes after take-off, but then the pilot said the problem had been resolved and he was going to go ahead to Jakarta.""
Pilots use 'Pan-Pan' calls to flag urgent situations. They are a step down from 'Mayday', which signals severe distress.
The Denpasar-Jakarta flight landed at the Indonesian capital's airport at 10:55 p.m. local time on Sunday.
The same Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet took off at 6:20 a.m. the next morning, bound for Bangka island, off Sumatra, and plunged into the sea 13 minutes later. Just before the crash, the pilot had made a request to return to base.
A Lion Air spokesman declined to comment when asked about the alert on the earlier flight, citing the ongoing crash investigation.
The budget airline's CEO, Edward Sirait, said earlier this week that a technical problem had occurred on the Denpasar-Jakarta flight but it had been resolved ""according to procedure"".
Amid media speculation over the airworthiness of the aircraft, the transport minister suspended Lion Air's technical director and three other officers on Wednesday to facilitate the crash investigation.
The suspended technicians ""issued the recommendations for that (final) flight"", the ministry said in a press release. It did not say how many technicians had been suspended.
The country's second-deadliest air disaster since 1997 has renewed concern about Indonesia's patchy aviation safety record.
It will also put a spotlight on Boeing's 737 MAX, which was introduced into commercial service last year and until Monday had an accident-free record. The narrowbody MAX is an update of Boeing’s 737 series, the world’s most produced family of commercial aircraft and one widely considered to have a strong safety record. 
ERRATIC FLIGHT
During its earlier flight from Bali on Sunday, JT43, the aircraft flew erratically and its airspeed readings were unreliable, according to an accident investigator and a flight tracking website.
According to data from FlightRadar24, the jet displayed unusual variations in altitude and airspeed in the first several minutes of flight - including an 875-foot drop over 27 seconds when it would normally be ascending - before stabilizing and flying on to Jakarta.
However, the pilots kept the plane at a maximum altitude of 28,000 feet compared with 36,000 feet on the same route earlier in the week.
National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) deputy chief Haryo Satmiko told reporters on Tuesday there were technical problems on the flight, including unreliable airspeed readings.
Divers on Thursday retrieved a flight data recorder from the plane that lay shattered on the muddy sea floor off the coast of Jakarta. The NTSC said it would examine the device to get a clearer picture of what happened on the flight from Bali on Sunday in addition to the flight that crashed on Monday.
Herson, the airport authority chief in Bali, said the aircraft had encountered a ""speed and altimeter"" problem but the captain was confident that it was airworthy and pressed on.
""He requested to return to the airport for RTB (return to base) but ... they updated and flew to Jakarta. The pilot double-checked to ensure that they could fly,"" he said.
Two passengers from Sunday's flight posted on Instagram, reporting that they had been concerned about problems with the air conditioning system and cabin lighting before the plane left Bali nearly three hours late.
Another passenger on JT43 described, in a talkshow broadcast by Indonesia's TVOne, a turbulent flight during which the seatbelt signs were never turned off.

""When the plane took off, it climbed and then went down. It rose again, and then dropped again violently, shaking,"" said Diah Mardani. ""Everyone in the plane shouted Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest), Subhanallah (Glory to God). We recited every prayer we knew.""

144,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Human rights in Morocco deteriorate in 2017-18: rights group,"RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco's most influential rights group AMDH deplored on Thursday what it said was a surge in political and arbitrary detentions of human rights campaigners, journalists and social activists.
In a report covering last year and the first half of 2018, the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) said there had been serious violations in remote parts of Rif - a predominantly Berber area which has been shaken by protests - as well as Jerada, Zagora and other regions.
""The numbers of political detainees surpassed those reported in the 1990s,"" AMDH president Ahmed ElHaij told a news conference, noting that 1,020 are either detained or being tried for their involvement in or support for peaceful protests across the kingdom. 
The government did not immediately respond to the report, although human rights minister Mustapha Ramid has said Morocco is neither a paradise nor a hell for rights.
In the wake of 2011 Arab Spring protests, Morocco adopted a new constitution enshrining freedom of speech, and promoting other rights such as the strengthening of an independent judiciary, and enshrining Amazigh - which is spoken by the Berber community - as a national language.
But seven years on, AMDH said Morocco is letting slide the freedoms and human rights commitments promised to protesters.
The state has dragged its feet on implementing its international commitments to fight torture, the 296-page report said. As for civil liberties, AMDH drew a bleak picture citing a violent crackdown by the state on peaceful protests notably in the Rif.
The Rif protests over economic and social demands erupted after the death of fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October 2016, who was crushed inside a rubbish truck trying to recover fish confiscated by police.
Last June, a Casablanca court handed jail terms to 52 people over the Rif demonstrations. Protest leader Nasser Zefzafi was sentenced in a first instance verdict to 20 years in prison.
The Rif demonstrations, along with those in the mining town of Jerada in early 2018, have been the most intense since the unrest in 2011 that prompted King Mohammed VI to devolve some of his powers to an elected parliament.
The report documented cases of the violation of press freedom which cost Morocco two places in the Reporters without Borders 2017 index where it ranks 133rd out of 180 countries.
AMDH denounced the trial of local journalists including Hamid El Mahdaoui who covered the Rif protests. It also called on the authorities to adopt a law protecting migrants and asylum seekers and to halt the deportation of migrants.

Morocco is struggling with an influx of African migrants seeking passage to nearby Europe.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted its 27th annual resolution calling for an end to the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba after a failed bid by Washington to amend the text to push Cuba to improve its human rights record.
The U.N. vote can carry political weight, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the more than 50-year-old embargo. The United States and Israel voted against the resolution, 189 countries voted in favor and Ukraine and Moldova did not vote.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the General Assembly that the resolution was an opportunity for countries ""to feel they can poke the United States in the eye.""
""But you're not hurting the United States when you do this. You are literally hurting the Cuban people by telling the regime that their treatment of their people is acceptable,"" she said ahead of the vote. 
The United States consistently voted against the U.N. resolutions for 24 years but abstained for the first time in 2016 under former President Barack Obama, as Washington and Havana forged a closer relationship.
But relations have deteriorated sharply since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, returning to Cold War characterizations of Cuba and tightening trade and travel restrictions that had been eased by Obama.
The United States voted against the U.N. resolution last year along with its ally Israel. The General Assembly's remaining 191 members voted in favor.
This year, the United States proposed eight amendments to the resolution, including calling on Cuba to ""fully grant its citizens internationally recognized civil, political and economic rights and freedoms, including freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and free access to information.""
But all of the amendments failed after more than 113 countries voted against them. Only the United States, Israel and Ukraine voted in favor of all eight amendments. More than 65 countries abstained. 
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Thursday the U.S. government lacked the ""moral authority"" to criticize Cuba and others on human rights. 
""The embargo is a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law,"" he said before the vote. ""It is an act of aggression and an act of economic war, which disrupts international peace and order.""

Last month, the United States launched a campaign at the United Nations that it said was designed to highlight the plight of Cuban political prisoners. Protesting Cuban and Bolivian diplomats drowned out the launch by shouting, chanting and banging their hands on desks.

The 40-year old, who has pursued a grueling work routine and travel schedule since his election last year, stoked speculation when he cleared his diary to take days off over the All Saints Day bank holiday.
Wearing a brown bomber jacket and wrapped in a gray scarf, a smiling Macron shook hands and took selfies with members of the public outside a restaurant in the picturesque northern French port where he had lunch with his wife Brigitte.
""As the general (Charles de Gaulle) used to say, it's always good to know how I'm doing by reading the press,"" Macron told reporters. 
""Everything's all right, don't worry,"" he said, adding cheerfully when asked whether he was tired: ""Do I look like I am? So, don't worry.""
In the first year of his term, Macron visited 27 countries, spending 68 days outside France, 10 more than his predecessor Francois Hollande and 14 more than Nicolas Sarkozy.
His aides and ministers said it is not unusual to receive texts from the former investment banker at 3 am and he is often seen online on his favorite Telegram messaging app in the early hours of the morning.
The French leader, whose popularity has fallen as low as 21 percent according to a YouGov poll for CNews published on Thursday, has also had to deal with a political scandal over the summer as well as a series of ministerial resignations that forced a cabinet reshuffle.
""There's no bout of fatigue, but yes, he's managing his efforts,"" a source at the Elysee Palace told Reuters earlier this week, pointing to the following week's hectic schedule. 
On Sunday, Macron will start a so-called seven-day ""wander"" across 11 French northeastern provinces ravaged by World War One battles, which ended 100 years ago this month. 
On Friday, he will host British Prime Minister Theresa May in the northern town of Albert, before laying a wreath at the memorial in Thiepval, commemorating British soldiers who died in the Battle of the Somme and have no known graves.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right president-elect has convinced crusading anti-graft judge Sergio Moro to become his justice minister, the two said on Thursday, delighting his supporters and enraging critics by hiring the jurist who jailed his chief political rival. 
Moro oversaw the so-called ""Operation Car Wash"" probe that convicted former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of bribery and money laundering, blocking him from running against Jair Bolsonaro earlier this year, when he led opinion polls.
A telegenic 46-year-old who has previously dismissed any political ambitions, Moro flew to Bolsonaro's beachside Rio de Janeiro home on Thursday, where he met with Brazil's next president for about an hour before both announced the decision.
""Federal judge Sergio Moro accepted our invite for the justice and public security ministry. His anti-corruption and anti-organized crime agenda, as well as his respect for the laws and the constitution, will be our guide,"" Bolsonaro tweeted.
The president-elect scores a clear political victory with the appointment of Moro, who gained a cult following in Brazil after he locked up a string of politicians and businessmen in the country's biggest-ever graft investigation.
Bolsonaro surged to victory on Sunday, promising to combat corruption and violent crime.
But the decision also gives ammunition to his opponents on the left, who have long argued that the ""Car Wash"" probe was a politicized purge aimed at sidelining Lula and his leftist Workers Party (PT).
As Brazilians geared up to vote last month, Moro came under fire for releasing plea-bargain testimony alleging a bribery scheme by PT members to fund their 2014 electoral campaign.
""Moro will be Bolsonaro's minister after his decisive role in his election, by blocking Lula from running,"" wrote PT President Gleisi Hoffmann on Twitter. ""Fraud of the century!""
In choosing to work with Bolsonaro, Moro appears to have cast aside criticisms about the political motivations behind his probe, attracted by the chance to rebuild Brazil's justice ministry under his own vision.
But working with Bolsonaro, who has upset many with racist, misogynist and homophobic comments and is accused of showing scant regard for democratic institutions, will also pose a unique set of challenges for Moro.
Bolsonaro denies his critics' allegations and pledges to respect the constitution. In comments to reporters aboard a plane on Thursday, Moro noted that Bolsonaro had won the votes of more than 55 million Brazilians.
WARMING TO POLITICS
In 2016, Moro said he would never enter politics, keeping the focus on his graft-fighting crusade in the courts. But the rise of Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman who has cast himself as a political maverick untainted by graft allegations, appears to have changed the judge's mind. 
Some on Bolsonaro's team would even like Moro to run for the presidency in 2022, according to a report by a Folha de S. Paulo columnist on the newspaper's website on Thursday.
Moro, whose name was floated as a possible presidential candidate in the run-up to this year's election, has seen his profile explode in just four years as his name became synonymous with probes targeting a corrupt political establishment.
"" Operation Car Wash"" was based on his studies of Italy's ""Clean Hands"" investigations that helped curtail the power of the Mafia in the early 1990s. He has said the Italian example shows the importance of political and popular support for anti-corruption initiatives.
Early last year, Moro enjoyed the support of nearly two- thirds of Brazilians in opinion polls. That figure dropped sharply after he sentenced Lula, a leftist icon still remembered fondly for reducing inequality during his 2003-2011 presidency.
During the campaign his wife, Rosangela Wolff Moro, came under fire for Instagram posts some saw as favorable to Bolsonaro. She applauded his second-round victory on Sunday on social media.
In a public statement, Moro said he would hand over the reins of the sprawling ""Car Wash"" investigation to other judges in his home town of Curitiba to avoid controversy.
Bolsonaro is expected to announce a full cabinet this month, ahead of his term beginning in January.

On Thursday, his top agriculture adviser said he had recommended a two-time congressman from the south of the country to become the new agriculture minister.

The procedure on a website carrying the Moroccan Foreign Ministry logo applies to a range of African countries whose citizens currently can enter Morocco without visas, except for Algeria and Tunisia.
The North African country has been grappling with a surge in migrants, arriving mainly on flights into Casablanca. Many intend to get into Europe and claim asylum by taking boats across a narrow Mediterranean strait to Spain, or scaling fences into the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta or Melilla bordering Morocco. 
The new procedure “aims to facilitate passenger traffic ... It will help Moroccan authorities know in advance the identity of travelers before boarding (planes),” reads a document issued by Morocco's embassy in Mali and seen by Reuters.
Morocco has come under European Union pressure to reduce crossings of illegal migrants to Spain and wants Rabat to set up ""disembarkation platforms"" - centers where migrants' asylum applications would be processed. Morocco has rejected the idea.
In Africa, Morocco offers visa-free entry to the nationals of Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Guinea Conakry, Congo Brazzaville, Gabon and Ivory Coast.
The new travel regulation took effect on Thursday for citizens of Congo Brazzaville, Guinea Conakry and Mali, according to a document from the Moroccan airline RAM.
Mali, Guinea and to a lesser extent Congolese nationals comprise the bulk of Europe-bound migrants coming to Morocco.
More than 40,000 African migrants have reached Spain's southern Andalucia coast by sea from Morocco since January.

MALE (Reuters) - Maldives' opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed, returning from exile on Thursday, said the new government, which his party backs, will work to pay off $3 billion of Chinese loans, mainly borrowed by the government of outgoing president Abdulla Yameen.
Nasheed, a former president, returned from nearly three years exile to a hero's welcome from his supporters after the Maldives Supreme Court stayed his 13-year sentence on terrorism charges this week. He has said the charges were politically motivated.
Thousands of people clad in yellow, the color of the Nasheed-led opposition, lined streets in the capital to greet the former president.
Nasheed walked the streets with his supporters, who waved party flags along with president-elect Mohamed Ibrahim Solih who Nasheed's Maldives Democratic Party (MDP), main party in the joint opposition, chose as presidential candidate.
Solih won a surprise presidential election victory on Sept. 23 and Yameen is due to hand over power on Nov. 17. Yameen's petition on election malpractices was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
""From the information I have, the debt to China alone is $3 billion. It will be a huge burden on the people. The government of Ibu will work to pay off these debts while developing the country,"" Nasheed, a close ally of Solih, told reporters.
The Maldives under Yameen grew close to China - to the alarm of traditional ally India - with China funding roads, bridges and an extension to the international airport as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of infrastructure projects in almost 70 countries from Mongolia to Montenegro.

The opposition and some analysts say Chinese involvement could lead to the tiny island chain in the Indian Ocean sinking deep into debt.

Denmark said on Tuesday it suspected the Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination on its soil. It is now calling for fresh European Union-wide sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
A Norwegian citizen of Iranian background was arrested in Sweden on Oct. 21 in connection with the plot and extradited to Denmark, Swedish security police have said.
""During the meeting we underlined that the activity, that has come to light through the investigation in Denmark, is unacceptable,"" Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a statement.
""We see the situation that has arisen in Denmark as very serious and that a Norwegian citizen of Iranian background is suspected in this case,"" she added. 
The attack was meant to target the leader of the Danish branch of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), Danish intelligence chief Finn Borch Andersen said.
ASMLA seeks a separate state for ethnic Arabs in Iran's oil-producing southwestern province of Khuzestan. Arabs are a minority in Iran, and some see themselves as under Persian occupation and want independence or autonomy.
The Norwegian citizen has denied the charges and the Iranian government has also denied any connection with what Norway suspects is a plot.

Merkel triggered the race to succeed her when the 13-year chancellor announced she was resigning her party office and preparing a gradual exit from politics after her conservatives suffered setbacks in two key regional elections last month.
With the race still in its very early stages, a YouGov poll for business daily Handelsblatt showed 23 percent of the public favoring Merz, an old rival whom Merkel defeated in an inner party battle almost two decades ago during her rise to the top.
With a month to go until a party congress chooses the new leader, 17 percent of those polled backed current CDU general-secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed ""mini-Merkel"" because of their political closeness to the chancellor.
A third candidate, Health Minister Jens Spahn, best known for his calls for tougher immigration controls, had the backing of 7 percent of the voters.
Though Merkel says she plans to stay in office until 2021, the party's new leader would be a leading candidate to succeed her, although only the centrist Kramp-Karrenbauer could easily continue the existing coalition with the Social Democrats.
More than a third of respondents had no view either way, suggesting that the picture could change radically in a race in which further candidates could yet emerge.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. watchdog told Sudan on Thursday to prosecute security forces for attacks in Darfur from 2014-2016 and cooperate with the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for President Omar al-Bashir for alleged war crimes.
Executions by crucifixion and stoning should be stricken from its statute books, and authorities should halt prosecutions and intimidation of journalists, critics and activists, it said.
Thousands of people have been killed in Sudan's civil wars, including the western Darfur region where rebels have been fighting against Bashir's government since 2003. In July, the government extended until year-end a three-year-old unilateral ceasefire with rebels in Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan.
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, whose independent experts uphold a landmark treaty on civil and political rights, reviewed Sudan's record and issued its findings on Thursday.
""The Committee is concerned that not only has (Sudan) failed to hold to account perpetrators under domestic law, but it has also refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, which has issued arrest warrants against Sudanese nationals and officials on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,"" the panel said.
The Hague-based ICC issued arrest warrants for Bashir in 2009 and 2010 over his alleged role in war crimes including genocide in Darfur province, which he denies.
""We expressed concerns regarding the fact that large-scale attacks against civilians, including in operations in Darfur between 2014 and 2016, remained unpunished,"" Sarah Cleveland, panel vice chair, told a news briefing.
Sudan should ""ensure that all persons involved in serious human rights violations are excluded from positions of power"", she said.
Yuval Shany, panel chair, said: ""We did not receive from the state a very specific answer to the question as to whether they are planning to implement the ICC arrest warrant on President al-Bashir. And we draw our conclusions from this lack of information.""
Journalists have been arrested or banned from travel, and newspapers confiscated, including the entire print runs of eight Sudanese newspapers in January, Cleveland said.
""So this was a primary concern with respect to Sudan and one which we asked them to report to the Committee on within two years,"" she said.

Journalists from Reuters and Agence France-Presse were detained in January while covering protests and clashes with security forces which broke out across Sudan after Khartoum imposed tough economic measures in line with recommendations by the International Monetary Fund.

LONDON, Ontario (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is faced with a dilemma as an election approaches - how to credibly clamp down on Riyadh over its human rights record while sparing a $13 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia.
Trudeau, who has promised ""consequences"" for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is under pressure to freeze an already unpopular $13 billion contract for armored vehicles built in Canada by U.S.-based General Dynamics (NYSE:GD).
The problem is that the deal underpins 3,000 jobs in the small city of London, Ontario, a recovering manufacturing center and a likely battleground in next year's federal vote.
The debate over the deal is worrying to members of Trudeau's ruling Liberal party, including Peter Fragiskatos, the lawmaker from the London North Centre parliamentary constituency.
""A lot of jobs depend on this contract,"" Fragiskatos said in an interview, noting Trudeau has visited the city several times and ""understands very well the challenges that London has faced. I am advocating very strongly for my community.""
A source directly familiar with official thinking said ""we don't want to lose those jobs"", but added it was also important for Canada to take a stand when human rights are violated.
""Canada is committed to upholding human rights, freedom of expression and the protection of journalists around the world,"" Trudeau said last week, and that Ottawa would review its export permits to Saudi Arabia in response to the death of Khashoggi, whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has sparked an international outcry. 
As for further penalties, a government official said on Monday that Canada is carrying out a ""comprehensive review of our relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" while trying to ""establish a credible narrative"" for the murder and coordinate a response with allies.
In recent years, Trudeau has cast himself and his government as standard-bearers for progressive values at a time when the United States is withdrawing from the global stage under President Donald Trump.
Canada is particularly sensitive to Khashoggi's murder after Riyadh abruptly severed diplomatic ties following Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland's tweet in August demanding the release of jailed activists.
Trudeau backed Freeland after the tweet and the two have been generally aligned on the murder of Khashoggi. But asked last week why Ottawa would go ahead with the arms deal, Freeland replied it was ""a very good question"" and declined to be more specific.
Trudeau has said scrapping the deal would cost ""billions"" in penalties.
Opposition critics and human rights groups say that if Trudeau is serious about standing up for human rights, he should cancel the deal.
Other nations are also grappling with how to send a strong message to the Gulf oil producer about its need to respect human rights while limiting the economic impact.
Germany halted new weapons sales to Riyadh, and Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for the rest of the European Union to adopt a similar position. Berlin is also reviewing sales that have already been approved, including contracts for patrol boats that are under construction.
But in Britain, the second-largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia after the United States, Prime Minister Theresa May's government has repeatedly rejected calls from opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to end arms sales to Riyadh. 
    ""There are jobs in the UK ... at stake so when it comes to the issue of arms sales we have our procedures,"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told lawmakers on Wednesday. 
CRUCIAL TO LIBERALS
London's newly elected mayor Ed Holder, a former Conservative minister who helped found the Canada Saudi Business Council and led a trade delegation to the kingdom in 2016, said the contract should not be canceled.
""I've been in contact with the federal government about that and I'm advised that they don't intend to cancel the contract,"" he said in a radio interview after his Oct. 22 election.
The political fallout of scrapping the deal could be significant. The Liberals control two of London's four seats and have a narrow, 12-seat parliamentary majority heading into a re-election campaign for a vote due by Oct. 21, 2019.
""Places like London, Ontario, will be crucial to the Liberals,"" said Darrell Bricker, head of Ipsos Public Affairs polling company.
The Liberals, at 36 percent, are just one point ahead of the Conservatives, with the left-leaning New Democrats, who say the Saudi military contract should be scrapped, are at 20 percent, according to the latest Ipsos poll.
While Trudeau has announced a review of export permits, those already issued are being respected, the government official said. That should spare General Dynamics any immediate impact. 
A 2016 document from the foreign ministry posted online shows General Dynamics had already received approval for C$11 billion worth of exports as part of the deal. Canada shipped C$166.9 million worth of armored vehicles and parts to Saudi Arabia in July, trade statistics show.
""We are continuing to build that vehicle on schedule, and we see no indication that contract has changed,"" General Dynamics Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a conference call last week. ""Steady as she goes.""

EDENVILLE, South Africa (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Nick Serfontein wrote an open letter to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa asking him to take the views of white farmers on board as the government considers expropriating land without compensation to reduce rural poverty.
Now Serfontein sits on a 10-person board advising the president where to go next, based on what he says is his own experience of trying to help black farmers who do not own land.
(Graphic: Farmland in South Africa - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Opt2a0)
Attempts to redistribute land from whites to blacks since the end of apartheid in 1994 have often failed and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) faces an election challenge next year from a far left party saying all land must be nationalized.
Ramaphosa has sought to reassure investors property rights will be protected and ANC officials have said South Africa will not follow the path of neighboring Zimbabwe, where often violent farm seizures triggered economic collapse.
Yet the measures Serfontein has taken underline the scale of the challenges of rebalancing a sector in which the white population, about 8 percent, owns most of the country's private land.
His Sernick Group focuses on large-scale cattle and beef production and has, since 2016, been acting as a financial intermediary for black farmers.
Sernick's counterpart was not a commercial bank but a state institution set up specifically to support agriculture, the Land Bank. It was struggling to lend money to black would-be farmers because they did not have land to offer as collateral.
""I said, 'if you can't lend money to people without security, lend it to me,'"" he told Reuters, outlining a model under which he then lent it on.
The program highlights a dependency that reflects disparities rooted in the colonial and apartheid past.
In 2016, the Land Bank lent 25 million rand ($1.7 million)via Serfontein, in 2017, 50 million rand, and this year it will extend 100 million rand. Total loans by the Land Bank are currently over 40 billion rand, many of them to whites.
The Land Bank's CEO TP Nchocho told Reuters that Serfontein's approach was an ""anchor farm model ... You can leverage off the capabilities of the anchor farmer. And it provides the access to finance"".
Serfontein admits that his model is not a panacea but sees it as a stepping stone. ""It’s not a long-term solution because you are not empowering the farmer,"" he said.
TITLE DEEDS
More than 60 black farmers now borrow from Serfontein to buy calves that are raised on Sernick's feed lots around the small town of Edenville, about 180 km (110 miles) south of the commercial capital, Johannesburg.
When their cattle are slaughtered, the farmers repay him and use any surplus to buy more cattle.
For the farmers involved, there are advantages and limits.
Solomon Mosoeu, 55, has been leasing 640 hectares from the government since 2011 and has grown his cattle herd from 36 to 160 with loans via Serfontein. He would like to diversify into crops, but cannot access the required finance because he does not own the farm.
""I would be happy if I had title deeds. I don’t have collateral. In farming there is nothing you can do without capital,"" he said as his cattle bellowed in the background.
The Department of Rural Development did not respond to requests for comment. ANC officials say they are looking at all options, including ways to unlock value in communal tribal and state-owned land.
While parliament has opened the way to a change of the constitution to allow land to be expropriated without compensation, a final decision will not be made until after the elections next year.
The far-left Economic Freedom Party, the EFF, which draws much of its support from the rural poor, describes ANC reforms as window-dressing to entrench ""white monopoly capital"".
Wandile Sihlobo, head of research at the Agricultural Business Chamber in South Africa and a member of the president's advisory panel, said title deeds were essential.

""There has to be a consideration for title deeds so that people can borrow against their land,"" he said. ""Capital is the key to progress or increased production. Without capital we will not be able to see a notable success.""

The West African former British colony rejoined the Commonwealth in February, five years after its now exiled authoritarian former leader Yahya Jammeh pulled Gambia out, dubbing the 54-member group a ""neo-colonial institution"".
""We are friends and partners, and once again we are both members of the Commonwealth family of nations,"" the prince said at a ceremony in Banjul's McCarthy Square (NYSE:SQ), hosted by President Adama Barrow.
Gambia, he said, was ""turning its back on 20 years of autocratic rule in order to embrace a new beginning,"" he said.
Jammeh, who fled Gambia last year after regional militaries launched an operation to remove him, repeatedly clashed with the British authorities over criticism of his government's human rights record.
Under Jammeh's 23-year rule, the country gained a reputation as a repressive state where journalists and political opponents were jailed, tortured and even murdered. 
Barrow, who won a December 2016 election that Jammeh rejected, is attempting to rehabilitate Gambia's image abroad.
Critics of the Commonwealth see it as an outdated relic of Britain's imperial past, while advocates say it gives small countries like Gambia a seat at the table with larger states, and has potential to improve life for its 2.4 billion residents.
Born of British and French colonial rivalry in the 19th century and surrounded by Francophone Senegal, Gambia - a tourist haven and groundnut producer - won independence from Britain in 1965.
Prince Charles, who was accompanied by his wife Camilla, visited a medical research facility run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and an armed forces training center, where Gambian troops are preparing for a peacekeeping mission in Sudan.
The royal pair will fly to Ghana on Friday and to Nigeria on Nov. 6.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Yemen government says it is ready to resume peace efforts, coalition silent","By Mohammed Ghobari
ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed Yemeni government said on Thursday it was ready to work on confidence-building measures under U.N.-led peace efforts as the United States pressed for an end to a war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of starvation.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are leading a coalition fighting Yemen's Iranian-aligned Houthi insurgents in a conflict that has lasted more than three years, have yet to publicly comment on calls by the United States and Britain for a ceasefire.
The fighting has killed more than 10,000 people, according to United Nations figures.
The alliance, which relies on Western arms and intelligence, was on Wednesday still sending troops to the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah where it has massed thousands of forces in recent days, pro-coalition Yemeni military sources said.
The kingdom's ties with the West have been strained by the furor over the killing of a prominent Saudi journalist at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, and its conduct in the Yemen war, in which hundreds of civilians have been killed in air strikes, has also come under closer scrutiny.
Any full-scale assault on the densely populated Red Sea city or port, which serves as a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, would further complicate relations with its main Western allies and risk triggering a famine in the impoverished country. 
The internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said it was ready to return to the negotiating table after U.N.-led consultations collapsed in September when the Houthi delegation failed to show up.
""The Yemeni government is ready to immediately discuss all confidence-building measures,"" it said in a statement.
Those steps should include freeing of prisoners, support for the central bank, reopening of airports and U.N. monitoring of Hodeidah port to prevent arms smuggling, it added.
The Houthis, who accuse the government of preventing their delegation from traveling to the last round of consultations, said on Tuesday that they are also willing to re-engage. 
NOWHERE TO GO
The coalition says that seizing control of Hodeidah would force the Houthi movement to its knees by cutting off its main supply line. But a previous offensive in June failed to achieve any gains and was halted to give peace talks a chance although battles between the warring sides have continued on and off.
The Houthis still control the capital Sanaa and the most populated areas of the country despite the air superiority of the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict, which is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
In Hodeidah city, residents already struggling to secure basic needs fear that things could get worse.
""There are continuous clashes south of the city and the entrance leading to Sanaa. We hear the sound of bullets and missiles clearly,"" Mohammed Abdullah told Reuters by telephone.
""The situation is dire and we don't know what our fate will be,"" he said. ""We can't leave the city, where would we go? It costs too much to travel and our friends who left for Aden or Sanaa are living in even worse conditions than us.""
Half the population of Yemen - some 14 million people - could soon be on the brink of famine, the United Nations says, in what it describes as the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis.
Save the Children estimates that 100 children on average are dying every day in Yemen from preventable causes like extreme hunger and disease.
""While the warring parties discuss the terms of this peace, we urge them to immediately stop the fighting so more lives aren't lost,"" Save the Children said in a statement and called for full access for aid and commercial imports. 
""It's time to end this war, for the sake of Yemen's children, who've suffered enough.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday called for a cessation of hostilities ahead of U.N.-led negotiations scheduled to begin next month, and Britain also backed an end to the fighting. At the same time, the two countries are Saudi Arabia's biggest arms suppliers.

""There are still Nusra militants in Idlib who are not stopping their attempts to wreck the implementation of the memorandum that was agreed between Russia and Turkey,"" Maria Zakharova, a spokesman for the ministry, was cited as saying.
Interfax quoted Zakharova as telling a news briefing in Moscow that the militants were continuing to shell Syrian government forces in the south of the province and to the north-west of Hama.
The agreement forged in September between Russia, which is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally, and Turkey, which backs the rebels, staved off a major government offensive into the opposition-held region in northwest Syria.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Until one sweltering day in 2009, Asia Bibi led a simple life with her husband and children in rural Pakistan. Hers was one of only three Christian families in her village but they'd never had much trouble from Muslim neighbors, relatives say.
""She was an innocent, loving and caring ordinary woman,"" said Bibi's brother-in-law, Joseph Nadeem. ""She and her husband both were farm workers. They had five kids and a happy life.""
Then, a dispute over a cup of water with fellow field laborers led to Bibi being sentenced to death for blasphemy against Islam. She spent eight years on death row before Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction this week and ordered her freed.
Bibi's ordeal has become symbolic of the difficulties that Pakistan's tiny Christian population, only 2.6 percent of the country of 208 million, faces along with other religious minorities as hard-line Islamist movements grow stronger.
Her family is now in hiding for fear of attacks by Islamists angry at the ruling, and still waiting to be reunited with Bibi
""You know my two youngest daughters were below age of 10 when their mother went away ... They don't remember spending much time with her,"" Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, told Reuters by telephone.
The family has four daughters and one son, he said.
""We are thankful to the court that it decided the case considering us human beings instead of any discrimination on the base of faith or religion.""
He said Bibi, who is about 50, has not been released from prison pending arrangements for her safety.
Thousands of members of a hardline Islamist party have blockaded roads for two days in major Pakistani cities to protest against the Supreme Court's decision, even calling for the assassination of the judges who made the ruling.
""She can't be safe here,"" brother-in-law Nadeem said. ""You know what's going on outside. We want things to settle down before we go ahead for her release.""
DISCRIMINATION
The rise of Islamist parties such as Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP), which has made ""death to blasphemers"" its main rallying cry, has many of Pakistan's religious minorities worried.
Though the TLP gained no National Assembly seats in a general election this year, it won 2.2 million votes nationwide. The party's fiery rhetoric also pulled much of the political discourse to the right in this deeply conservative country.
Pakistan is about 96 percent Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim, with Christians, Hindus and members the Ahmadi faith making up tiny minorities.
Christians in Pakistan are often targeted in attacks by militants, including a pre-Christmas suicide bomb attack last year on a Methodist church that killed more than 50 people in the southwestern city of Quetta. The attack was claimed by Islamic State's local affiliate.
Christians are also frequent targets of discrimination and violence. In 2013, a mob burned down more than 125 Christian homes in a neighborhood of Lahore after rumors spread that a Christian resident had insulted the Prophet Mohammad. 
Religious minorities are also far more likely to be charged with blasphemy than Muslims.
Despite their tiny percentage of the population, Christians, Hindus and Ahmadis made up half of the 1,549 cases of blasphemy filed over three decades through 2017, according to Peter Jacobs, the Christian head of the Centre for Social Justice, which compiled the numbers.
Pakistan's constitution guarantees freedom of religion and - as the Supreme Court's ruling Wednesday stressed - Islam's holy Koran stresses tolerance and fighting injustice. The ruling said that evidence against Bibi was insufficient to convict her.
Bibi's family says that for years, they lived side by side with Muslim neighbors in the village of Ikkawali, in the bread-basket province of Punjab.
""You know, the society we live in, we are often discriminated against as Christians but she was living a happy life,"" said Nadeem.
'ENEMY'
That all changed on June 14, 2009, when Bibi offered a cup of water to her Muslim fellow field workers. A woman refused, saying anything from the hand of a Christian was unclean, according to the Supreme Court ruling.
The incident led to harsh words and a police complaint several days later, then the court case that saw Bibi sentenced to death.
""Just sipping water from a mug made the whole village her enemy,"" said Nadeem.
With Bibi soon to be free, her family is struggling to make plans. They would prefer to leave the country to be safe, but there are plans in place.
""We haven't got any contact yet either from Pakistani authorities or anyone from outside,"" Nadeem said. 
Yet, despite all the family has been through, Bibi's husband Masih said he would be sad to be forced to leave his homeland.
""We're also part of Pakistan,"" he said.

""This is our country. We love it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Roslyn Jaffe and her husband decided to start the first dressbarn store in the early 1960s, it was a retail experiment. 
Discounting was new to the industry, but the Jaffes decided to try it out with one store in Stamford, Connecticut. Elliot kept his day job at Macy's while Roslyn traveled around filling up the family station wagon with bargains.
They added on stores at a steady clip, raised three kids and now the business operates as the Ascena Retail Group, with son David as CEO and daughter Elise as senior vice president of real estate. The company, whose stock price has struggled in recent years like many American retailers, has some 4,600 stores in the United States and Canada among eight brands, which along with dressbarn also include Ann Taylor, Justice and Lane Bryant. 
Reuters spoke with Roslyn Jaffe, 89, who concentrates her efforts now on philanthropic work. This includes the yearly Jaffe Awards from her family foundation to benefit women and children. The $100,000 grand prize winner this year is Generation Hope, a Washington, D.C. charity that fights poverty. The two $25,000 recipients are the Breast Treatment Task Force, which provides free screenings to women, and the Summer Learning Collaborative, which provides summer enrichment to low-income students. 
Q: You met Eleanor Roosevelt when you were in high school. How did that inspire you? 
A: I’m from Waterbury, Connecticut, which was a mill town. During the wartime years, Eleanor Roosevelt came to town, and there was a luncheon at a big hotel. 
A friend and I just walked out the door of school and walked downtown to the hotel. We never expected to achieve much, but I guess at that stage we were young and foolish. 
We managed to get in a side door. When Mrs. Roosevelt walked out eventually, she stopped, turned around, and she greeted us. She never asked us how we got there. She was delicate about the whole thing. We answered and keep staring in awe. She was just remarkable. 
I think what she did was show me that I could do things. I was very shy. People always commented they couldn’t hear what I was saying. I wasn’t conscious of it then, but as time went on, I did things I didn’t think I could do and it was because that gave me a lot of courage. 
Q: What mistakes did you make in the early days? 
A: I’m not going to admit to any mistakes! The only thing was we moved very slowly. We opened one store a year. We had three kids and a house. If a store failed, it could almost take the whole thing down. It was slow, but it was very steady. 
Q: When did you first feel like you had a success on your hands? 
A: When we reached six stores. It was great and they were all working, and they were all in Connecticut. Then we started spreading out. 
Q: Did your views on investing change as you made more money? 
A: We invested everything back into the stores. At first, we owned two buildings in which our stores were involved. Then we decided that we either had to do retail or real estate. We decided we wanted to be retailers. Then we never owned real estate after that. 
Q: How did your charitable interests develop? 
A: As a child, my grandparents on my mother’s side lived with us. They had come over from Europe. They brought with them the (Jewish) idea of ""tzedakah"" – you have a little box and put change in it. These traditions have always stayed with me. 
Q: What money lessons do you want to pass on to your children and grandchildren? 
A: I think with all three (of our children), the work ethic was very important. They lived in the house with us, they saw how we operated. We put them to work. On Sundays, they’d help open boxes and put things on hangars. They’d play with the tickets and sort them by color. They knew red was size 9. 
We have a foundation, and we plan on taking the grandchildren into it, but for the time being, it’s just the three kids and us. 
Q: What legacy do you want to pass along with your business, especially as retail companies struggle? 

A: I’m concerned about the next 10 years. What’s going to happen to retailing? I have no idea. What’s important is that we maintain our attitude and approach with our customers. That has always been very important to me.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - No matter who wins Madagascar's presidential election next week, Soloniaina Rakotomamonjy wants the victor to bring jobs to a country shackled by poverty despite immense resource wealth.
In an irony in one of Africa's poorest countries, the result of the first round of voting could hinge in part on which of the three front-runners -- all wealthy men -- has spent the most money campaigning for the Nov. 7 contest.
Rakotomamonjy, 20, does odd jobs in construction and works at a roadside open-air restaurant when the owner has enough business to hire extra staff. 
He will vote in the Indian Ocean island nation's election on Wednesday, he says, for the first time in his life because he wants to participate and ""make the choice like everyone else"". 
Like many other young Malagasy, he says, he wants a leader who ""can change the lives of young people"" by creating jobs. 
He is not holding his breath. 
""I just have to keep working as many jobs as I can find in order to get by,"" he said, heading back to the building site where he had already been at work for four hours by 8 a.m. one morning this week. 
In the run-up to the poll the three leading candidates have toured the country making electoral promises that many voters don't expect them to keep: The three are President Hery Rajaonarimampianina and his two main challengers, both former heads of state themselves: Marc Ravalomanana and Andry Rajoelina. 
Handing out sacks of rice and t-shirts, the top candidates have hired helicopters for many thousands of dollars a day to sidestep the problem of rundown roads across the country, famed for its exotic wildlife and luxury vanilla spice.
HEAVY CAMPAIGN SPENDING ALLOWED
Though relative political stability since a 2013 election has enabled the economy to rebound, the country of 25 million people remains among Africa's poorest. About 80 percent of the population lives on less than $2 per day. 
Unemployment is under two percent, official statistics show, but a 2015 government study found that ""disguised unemployment"" was at least 20 percent and underemployment was rampant. 
Though there are 36 candidates on the ballot, only two could advance to a possible run-off on Dec. 19.
The three front-runners are wealthy and have been repeatedly accused by local civil society groups of having used their time in office to enrich themselves.
The three deny the allegations.
Ravalomanana, toppled in a 2009 coup, was criticized while in office for not tackling corruption. Rajoelina, the man who ousted him, was accused by conservation groups of profiting from illegal plundering of natural resources. 
The current president is under fire from civil society groups for signing a fisheries agreement in September with Chinese firms -- the deal is opaque, civil society groups say, and will rob local fisherman of their livelihoods.
On the campaign trail all three men pledged to accelerate the recovery of the economy, forecast by the IMF to grow at more than five percent this year, the highest rate in a decade. Since a peaceful election in 2013, investors and donor governments re-engaged following a four-year freeze after the coup. 
Heavy spending on campaigning is permitted -- no national laws cap it -- and some analysts have predicted the results of the first round of the election will hinge on cash, not issues.
Transparency International tried to get candidates to fill out a public questionnaire on how much they had spent on their campaign. Just one of the 36 people on the ballot -- a pop star who goes by the nickname Dama -- responded, saying he had spent around two billion ariary (about $565,000) in the one-month official campaign period that ends on Monday.
One person commented on Transparency International's Madagascar Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page: ""If he has spent this much on his campaign, I wonder how much the others have spent on theirs.""
One out of every two children is stunted by malnutrition according to the World Food Programme. The U.N. agency says around 1.2 million people need food aid in the southern part of the country, where the frequency of droughts has increased over the past decade, pushing farmers deeper into poverty. 
In an interview with Reuters this week as the campaign period wrapped up, the incumbent Rajaonarimampianina said economic growth would soar into the double digits, enabling the creation of millions of jobs, if he wins a second term: ""I've developed a vision of transformation and growth of Madagascar ... which is a vision of emergence and rebirth.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - For nearly 30 years, Sandy Lam has been rising early each day for a dip in the sometimes choppy waters off the western edge of Hong Kong island, next to one of the world's busiest ports. 
Lam, 68, is part of a tightly-knit community of around 50 mostly elderly citizens who are regular visitors to Sai Wan Swimming Shed, tucked away off a steep hill, providing basic changing rooms and showers. 
""We're all friends and we've known each other for a long time,"" he said. ""We pay HK$150 ($19) per month which pays for the water and light in the shed, and for the changing rooms to be kept well.""
The shed, built in the 1960s or 1970s, is the sole survivor of such structures, popular in the first half of the last century when public swimming facilities were sparse in the former British colony, and is now a hit with tourists and newlyweds. 
The residents, many of who have been swimming there for decades, plunge into the waters from steps reached by a spindly wooden bridge propped up on the rocks, just a stone's throw from the heart of the financial center against a busy backdrop of container ships, ferries and fishing boats. 
""I've been coming here for 40 years, every single day,"" said 83-year-old Yin Sing. ""I walk up the hill to come here, even on a Sunday."" 
Most of the swimmers say the exercise keeps them healthy, although they have noticed changes in water quality over the decades. 
""I feel there is more plastic in the sea,"" said Dennis Yeung, 58. ""I have noticed a difference since I've been swimming here from when I was small... There is quite a big difference. In the future, it will be more of a problem too.""

In a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the anti-immigration leader of the League party read a letter from prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania informing him that they had formally asked a judge to drop the case. He gave no reason for their decision.
Salvini had been placed under investigation for alleged abuse of power and holding people against their will after the Italian ship Diciotti was denied permission in August to let off migrants, mainly Eritrean, who had been rescued at sea. 
Salvini had said he would refuse to let the migrants disembark until other European Union states agreed to take them in. The 10-day standoff ended when Ireland, Albania and the Roman Catholic Church agreed to take charge of some of the migrants.
About 650,000 people have reached Italian shores since 2014, mostly from Africa, and the country houses about 160,000 asylum seekers.
Salvini has led a popular crackdown against immigration since Italy's coalition government took office in June.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities on Thursday retrieved a flight data recorder from a Lion Air jet that crashed and broke apart in shallow sea near the capital, Jakarta, this week, killing all 189 people on board.
The country's second-deadliest air disaster since 1997 has prompted renewed concern about Indonesia's patchy aviation safety record, and the government has said Lion Air will face tougher safety regulation.
Investigations into the world's first crash of a  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX, introduced into commercial service last year, will be scrutinized by the global aviation industry.
""Hopefully, this can unveil the mystery behind the plane crash,"" Indonesia's transportation safety committee chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told a news conference at Jakarta's main port after receiving the device, known as a black box. 
The data it holds should provide clues to what went wrong with the plane, which had only been in service since August.
It lost contact with ground staff just 13 minutes after taking off early on Monday from Jakarta, on its way to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
The pilot had asked to return to base shortly after take-off, and ground control officials had approved the request.
A navy diver told broadcaster Metro TV on board a search vessel his team found the orange-colored box intact in debris on the muddy sea floor.
Indonesia's transportation safety committee (KNKT) will analyze its data in Jakarta, which could take up to two weeks. 
Searchers have yet to find the second black box containing recordings of cockpit conversations. Strong currents have hampered search efforts, complicated by the presence of energy pipelines in the area.
The discovery of the black box may provide some relief to grieving relatives. But hopes are fading of finding a large section of fuselage intact with bodies, easily retrievable, inside.
The commander of the navy divers involved in the search was quoted by the Kompas.com news portal as saying divers had found many bodies. But only one has been identified.
""What is important for us is to get more information about the victims because having their remains back is important for us so we can bury them properly,"" said Ade Inyo, whose brother in law was on the flight.
MORE INSPECTIONS, SAFETY REVIEW
The investigation will be carried out with help from Boeing,  General Electric  (N:GE) and the Federal Aviation Federation, officials have said.
It will also focus on four of Lion Air's staff including its technical director who were suspended by Indonesia's transportation ministry on Wednesday amid speculation the aircraft was not airworthy.
""For now, we will focus on two primary causes,"" KNKT deputy chief Haryo Satmiko told Reuters, referring to equipment and the people who flew, maintained and managed the aircraft.
The transport ministry suspended for 120 days Lion Air's maintenance and engineering director, fleet maintenance manager and the release engineer who gave the jet permission to fly on Monday, it said in a press release.
Founded in 1999, the privately owned budget carrier's aircraft have been involved in at least 15 safety incidents and it has faced tougher international safety restrictions than other Indonesian airlines. 
It will now be subjected to more intensive ""on ramp"" inspections compared with other airlines, authorities said.
President Joko Widodo has also ordered a review of all regulations relating to flight safety.
Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. Its transportation safety committee investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017.
Lion Air said the aircraft that crashed had been airworthy and the pilot and co-pilot had 11,000 hours of flying time between them.
But according to the transport safety committee, the plane had technical problems on its previous flight on Sunday, from the city of Denpasar on the resort island of Bali, including an issue over ""unreliable airspeed"".
Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait has acknowledged reports of technical problems with the aircraft, but said maintenance had been carried out ""according to procedure"" before it was cleared to fly again.
Lion Air's only other fatal accident was in 2004, when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of the 163 people on board, according to the Flight Safety Foundation's Aviation Safety Network.

In April, the airline announced a firm order to buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets with a list price of $6.24 billion. It is one of the U.S. planemaker's largest customers globally, and was the first carrier globally to take delivery of the 737 MAX last year.

MADRID (Reuters) - When Santiago Abascal stood up to address supporters in the conference room of a Barcelona hotel earlier this year, the far-right party leader knew something had changed.
The room was overflowing with 2,000 people. At earlier rallies, he had struggled to attract more than a few dozen.
""When I saw all those people in that room, I immediately understood something different was going on,"" the 42-year-old told Reuters.
Once dismissed as an outlier in Spanish politics, Abascal is starting to make waves in a country that has until now resisted the populist political currents sweeping Europe.
Pollsters predict that his four-year-old VOX party, which espouses tougher immigration policies and a weaker European Union, will secure its first few parliamentary seats at European elections next year.
VOX could even win one or more seats in Spain's national assembly in a general election due by mid-2020, becoming the first far-right party to enter the Spanish parliament since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975 - and a potential kingmaker.
Support for the party erupted this year following a secessionist campaign in Catalonia, which prompted a nationalist backlash against Spain's autonomous regions.
But voters who backed the conservatives or socialists over the past 40 years are also seduced by VOX's anti-establishment credentials and tough line on anything from abortion to immigration.
At an event in the city of Valencia earlier this month, more than 1,000 people of all ages and backgrounds packed a restaurant on a Wednesday night to listen to Abascal.
Amparo Bergara, a 70-year-old pensioner who had always voted for the People's Party (PP), said she would vote for VOX at the next election.
""I am worried about our future and the future of my children,"" she said, complaining about pension cuts. ""Spain is in bad shape and somebody needs to fix it."" 
But so far VOX is not seen as likely to become a national force in Spanish politics.
RISING
Abascal is the son of a Basque politician from the PP who for decades faced death threats from separatist group ETA.
Part of VOX's success directly hinges on the image Abascal projects of a strong and energetic leader. He wears sharp suits and a neatly trimmed beard and until recently carried a pistol to protect his father and himself from those threats.
VOX is also relying on public figures who appeal to various types of voters, including a bullfighter, a comedian, a former TV presenter, a prison officer who was kidnapped by ETA, and the father of a teenager who was raped and murdered.
And in a bid to emulate the swift rise of upstart Spanish parties Podemos and Ciudadanos, VOX is betting on the grass roots to get its message out.
In Madrid, dozens of party sympathizers give up their weekends to staff information desks in the streets of targeted neighborhoods - upscale and working class - to engage voters.
They explain how VOX would break up ""the system"", its name for Spain's political and financial elite, suspend the political autonomy of the regions, scrap a law that protects women from domestic violence, and better safeguard Spain's borders.
In September alone more than 100 street events were held in Madrid and earlier this month 10,000 people attended a rally to showcase VOX's new political manifesto.
VOX also uses social media a lot, because without parliamentary representation, traditional media has not paid it much attention. VOX is fond of Instagram and says a lot of voters have come to it through Whatsapp. The party's paid-up membership has doubled to around 13,000 in the past four months.
While this remains tiny compared to other national parties, the boost to VOX's finances paves the way for future expansion.
VOX will use the money to open a new headquarters in central Madrid and hire new staff, Abascal said. It also plans to spend more on social media advertising.
""MAKE SPAIN GREAT AGAIN""
Opinion polls show the strategy is bearing fruit.
An October poll predicted VOX would win 1.3 percent of the vote, enough to potentially win one seat or more in the national parliament.
Another survey put the party on 5.1 percent and around 1 million votes, 20 times more than the last general election in 2016.
Most political analysts doubt VOX can grow into a national force because it has failed to attract voters outside the upper middle class.
""The average VOX voter is a far-right voter and the party struggles to convince people who sit elsewhere on the political spectrum,"" said Jose Fernandez-Albertos, a sociologist from Spain's National Research Council (CSIC).
""My feeling is that the party may not be that successful when it comes to changing the political landscape or winning elections, but it may put on the agenda issues that other parties didn't want to touch on,"" Fernandez-Albertos said.
Like VOX, most European populist parties now in government or setting the agenda in countries such as Italy, Germany or France first targeted European elections, which are often used by voters to voice discontent.
While they often achieved poor results initially, they used the European Parliament to make headway with less radical voters.
At the last European Parliament elections in 2014, the League scored barely 6 percent of the Italian vote. Now, it has the upper hand in a ruling coalition and the latest opinion polls put it at around 30 percent, overtaking its coalition partner, the 5-Star Movement, as the country’s most popular party.
The Alternative for Germany party won seven seats in the 2014 European election. In 2017, it won seats in 14 of the 16 German state parliaments and 93 seats in the Bundestag, becoming the country’s third-largest party.
SOVEREIGN STATES
Abascal, who is against a federal Europe but would be happy with a union of sovereign states, and would keep Spain in the euro, is also trying to make headway abroad.
He said he had established contact with France's National Rally and Germany's Alternative for Germany, among others, and is an admirer of Italy's Matteo Salvini despite the League's backing for Catalan independence.
He is also in touch with Steve Bannon, who is trying to unite Europe's far-right ahead of the May 2019 European elections, although he said VOX would not become a satellite for the movement run by Donald Trump's former campaign strategist.
""VOX does not respond to any international interest, only to the interest of Spain,"" Abascal said. ""We want to decide the next Spanish government and we believe we may have a shot at it.""

170,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 08:35AM ET</span>",A populist makes waves in Spain – and he’s proving popular,"By Belén Carreño and Julien Toyer
MADRID (Reuters) - When Santiago Abascal stood up to address supporters in the conference room of a Barcelona hotel earlier this year, the far-right party leader knew something had changed.
The room was overflowing with 2,000 people. At earlier rallies, he had struggled to attract more than a few dozen.
""When I saw all those people in that room, I immediately understood something different was going on,"" the 42-year-old told Reuters.
Once dismissed as an outlier in Spanish politics, Abascal is starting to make waves in a country that has until now resisted the populist political currents sweeping Europe.
Pollsters predict that his four-year-old VOX party, which espouses tougher immigration policies and a weaker European Union, will secure its first few parliamentary seats at European elections next year.
VOX could even win one or more seats in Spain's national assembly in a general election due by mid-2020, becoming the first far-right party to enter the Spanish parliament since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975 - and a potential kingmaker.
Support for the party erupted this year following a secessionist campaign in Catalonia, which prompted a nationalist backlash against Spain's autonomous regions.
But voters who backed the conservatives or socialists over the past 40 years are also seduced by VOX's anti-establishment credentials and tough line on anything from abortion to immigration.
At an event in the city of Valencia earlier this month, more than 1,000 people of all ages and backgrounds packed a restaurant on a Wednesday night to listen to Abascal.
Amparo Bergara, a 70-year-old pensioner who had always voted for the People's Party (PP), said she would vote for VOX at the next election.
""I am worried about our future and the future of my children,"" she said, complaining about pension cuts. ""Spain is in bad shape and somebody needs to fix it."" 
But so far VOX is not seen as likely to become a national force in Spanish politics.

Police fired teargas overnight at hundreds of youths who barged through the city center of Lyon, hassling police and passers by, shattering shop windows and setting rubbish bins on fire.
In the deprived Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, a sportswear store was looted and young people robbing a grocery store attacked police with acid, according to Denis Jacob of police union Alternative Police.
Authorities said the riots were stoked by messages circulated on social media, apparently inspired by the Hollywood horror film franchise ""The Purge"", which depicts a violent dystopia in which all crimes are made legal for a day.
""Halloween must remain a celebration, the purge is not a joke, the purge is a threat,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters on Thursday.
A young man who wrote a Snapchat message calling for the ""purge"" against police forces was arrested earlier this week. He was released on Tuesday pending trial on Nov. 28, police said.
Castaner said 15,000 police were deployed all across France on Wednesday night in anticipation, and that violence was less severe than a year ago.
Youths in depressed suburbs of French cities have been torching hundreds of vehicles on New Year's Eve and Bastille Day since the early 1990s. 
Halloween is not traditionally celebrated in France, although it has become more visible since the late 1990s under the influence of American films and TV series, with shop windows often showing hollowed out pumpkin heads and witches.

Turkey expected Saudi Arabia to co-operate in its investigation and there must be no cover-up, minister Abdulhamit Gul told reporters.
""We are looking for answers to the question of where the body is,"" he said.
Khashoggi wrote a column for the Washington Post that criticized the Saudi government and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The Saudi government initially denied Khashoggi had been killed then later said he died in an unplanned ""rogue operation"". Last week, the kingdom's public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb said the attack was premeditated.
""This case cannot be covered up, and we are expecting close cooperation from Saudi authorities on the investigation we are conducting transparently and meticulously,"" Gul said.
Istanbul chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan said after talks with Mojeb on Monday and Tuesday that Khashoggi was suffocated in a premeditated killing as soon as he entered the consulate, and his body was then dismembered and disposed of.

With people often driving long distances and an extensive network of speed cameras, Estonia is near the top of European speeding statistics, with 12-15 percent of drivers fined annually, according to Estonian Road Administration figures. 
Now police are handing out cards to drivers caught speeding with information about organ donorship and how to sign up to show them the risks of the road.
""We do not expect the campaign to increase the number of organ donors as we certainly hope not to have more deaths, but we hope it will make people think a little more,"" Andres Sinimeri, head of the Parnu police station in southern Estonia, told Reuters.
""The winter is coming and roads become really slippery - in this situation the speed kills,"" he said.

""The perpetrators must be brought before a court and punished severely,"" Annette Widmann-Mauz, minister of state for migration, refugees and integration, told the RND news organization.
German police arrested the seven Syrian men, aged 19 to 29, along with a 25-year-old German man last month on suspicion of raping the woman in the southwestern town of Freiburg.
One of the men is suspected of drugging the woman's drink in a Freiburg nightclub before they all took turns at sexually assaulting her in a thicket outside.
The crime has shocked Freiburg, a picturesque university town, and risks stirring up anti-refugee sentiment across the country as the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) seeks to cement itself as the leading opposition party.
""All asylum seekers must receive signposting courses on co-existence in Germany as soon as they arrive in Germany, or at the initial reception center, and that includes zero tolerance for sexual abuse and other acts of violence,"" said Widmann-Mauz.
In her role as minister of state for migration, Widmann-Mauz works in the chancellery under Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The AfD's rise is attributed in part to a public backlash against the arrival of more than a million migrants since mid-2014, many of them from Middle East conflict zones.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>","Special Report: U.S. Marine families battle mice, mold and landlords","By Deborah Nelson and M.B. Pell
CAMP PENDLETON, California (Reuters) - When Matt Limon enlisted in the U.S. Marines, he and wife Sharon were prepared to make sacrifices for their country: faraway deployments, long absences and frequent moves for a family with two young children.
Those hardships didn’t drive them from the military. The mice in their duplex did.
Not just one or two: Dozens invaded their home on the Marine base here, leaving trails of feces and urine across the carpeting and chewing through containers in the pantry. Sharon reported the infestation in May 2017 to Lincoln Military Housing, a private company that controls most of the 7,900 housing units on base at Camp Pendleton. Lincoln sent a pest control worker to lay traps. The problem worsened.
“The two-year-old, he doesn't say very many words, but ‘mouse poop’ is one of them,” Sharon said. “I would pick him up out of bed in the morning and he'd have mouse poop stuck to his leg.”
In August, Lincoln moved the family into temporary housing while more traps were laid. The mice retreated. Then water suddenly rained from a smoke detector. And the mice returned.
The Limons moved off base last November, taking out a $4,000 loan to do so. Then Lincoln hit them with a $1,084 bill to replace the rodent-contaminated carpet.
Lincoln blamed the infestation on the family’s housekeeping, she said. It pointed to dishes in the sink, and photographed a carpet soiled by the family’s new puppy. Sharon had talked to the previous tenants, however, and they too had reported a mouse invasion. They showed the Limons a rodent hole still in the home. And they provided texts from neighbors discussing their own infestations.
Philip Rizzo, Lincoln’s vice president of operations, told Reuters the Texas-based company worked hard to combat the vermin, and billed the family because the carpet had other stains. Even so, he said, Lincoln offered in June to drop the charge – if the couple signed a non-disclosure agreement. “Mrs. Limon was still going on Facebook” to complain, he said. “And we said, ‘That has to stop.’ ” The couple refused to sign.
Disheartened, Corporal Limon, who had served in the Middle East, left the Marines when his tour of duty ended this August. The Limons still owe Lincoln.
“He was supposed to retire out of the Marine Corps,” his wife wrote to Reuters on his last day. “None of this was ever part of the plan.”
WEAK RIGHTS
The Limons had been defeated by two forces that can trap military families in substandard homes across the United States: powerful private landlords and inadequate tenant rights.
Under California law and in other states, tenants in unsafe or decrepit housing can get out of their leases. They can make repairs and deduct the cost from rent. They can call local government agencies to enforce health codes. But on federal military bases, different rules apply.
Tenant rights are set by the military and private landlords under contracts that give companies control of housing for 50 years but lack basic protections civilians take for granted. As a result, military families have little recourse in resolving health threats such as rodents and mold, a Reuters investigation found. Reporters analyzed thousands of pages of contract documents, tested for mold in homes, inspected photographic evidence and spoke with more than 100 families living on U.S. Navy, Marine, Army or Air Forces bases. What emerges is a detailed portrait of their struggles with these landlords in disputes over household hazards.
“We have an entire segment of society that is putting its life on the line for the rest of us, and effectively they are walled off from accessing these laws and the remedies under them,” said Emily Benfer, a professor at Columbia University Law School who works with tenants and nonprofits to get landlords to improve housing conditions.
These tenants find themselves contending with Goliaths. Lincoln, a contractor at Camp Pendleton, is among the biggest of the military landlords, managing one of every five units in the privatization program. In all, the company and its affiliates manage 36,000 military family homes.
Reuters calculates that the public-private housing projects in which Lincoln participates reap nearly $875 million in revenue a year from military housing tenants, roughly a fifth of the $4 billion a year the Defense Department pays in rent stipends for privatized on-base housing. Lincoln sometimes partners with other companies that do new construction and renovations, but Lincoln manages the base housing operations.
Lincoln Military President Jarl Bliss said the problems documented by Reuters at its homes are exceptions. “We can't run 36,000 homes and do all the services that we provide across these branches of government and have a 100 percent success rate,” he said.
He cited high ratings from tenants in surveys and high occupancy rates in Lincoln’s homes – above 90 percent – as signs of satisfaction.
“The families have a choice,” he said. “They don't have to live with us.”
U.S. Senator Mark Warner, D-Virginia, whose state is home to thousands of enlisted families, called the cases documented by Reuters “simply unacceptable.”
“It’s deeply troubling to hear firsthand accounts of military families that continue to be exposed to dangerous living conditions,” Warner said. “This is not how the nation should treat our troops for their selfless sacrifice.”
CONFLICTING INTERESTS
The housing contracts, families say, give the landlords the edge in disputes. Many states and municipalities, for instance, allow tenants to withhold rent when landlords fail to meet basic health, structural and safety standards. That was not a ready option for another Camp Pendleton Marine family struggling with Lincoln over mold blooms and illness earlier this year. If service members live on base, the housing allowances they receive as part of their pay typically go directly from the government to their landlord.
In many localities, tenants suffering serious housing problems also can move without penalty. In military housing, families can’t count on that safeguard. That was true for a family with persistent leaks and mold in their home on the Naval base in Gulfport, Mississippi. They would have had to pay a Pennsylvania-based landlord more than $1,000 to break their lease, so they stayed. After Reuters inquiries, housing operator Balfour Beatty Communities moved the family into a hotel as it hauled out mold-covered drywall.
U.S. localities typically have authority to order landlords to address violations of local housing and health codes. These protections rarely extend to tenants on military bases. When an Army family encountered mice, cockroaches, leaks and mold in housing run by a New Jersey-based company at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, they could not turn to local health code enforcers. The civilian inspectors don’t have authority to go on base.
Enlisted families can complain to base officials. But if they do, they’re turning to a military hierarchy that’s in partnership with the private companies operating base housing. The system creates an inherent collision of interests pitting service members against the military-industry partnership. With little oversight, landlords have tremendous power.
“Military families have two choices – put up and shut up or pay the astronomical cost of moving off base,” said Crystal Cornwall, a Marine spouse at Quantico in Virginia. She is leading a grassroots effort to mobilize military spouses to press Congress for better protections. More than 1,300 have joined a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group she helps administer.
In New Orleans, Bonnie Plettner and her Marine captain husband fought Louisiana-based Patrician Management for more than a year, seeking repairs to broken outlets, peeling paint and a water leak in privatized Navy housing. When the couple investigated a foul odor coming from the air vents, they found what appeared to be black mold, Plettner said. Patrician denied it was mold and declined to do additional testing, emails show.
Plettner asked local and state officials to conduct a safety inspection; they told her they had no jurisdiction on base, she said. Naval medical staff said they could not order testing, because she lived in privatized housing. Her husband’s superiors warned that Patrician could terminate their lease if she continued to complain. “I have been told … over and over again, ‘Not my problem, not my jurisdiction,’” Plettner said.
After their one-year-old child developed respiratory problems, they paid $1,500 themselves to clean the ducts in the summer of 2017. Patrician refused to reimburse them and, without explanation, declined to renew their lease. The couple scrambled to move off base.
Mark Wesley, Patrician’s area manager, said “all issues were addressed and completed” in the home and that “Patrician was within its authority to issue a non-renewal notice.”
Plettner contacted the Navy’s hotline in Washington D.C. The Inspector General replied in a letter that, under the Navy’s contractual relationship with the housing managers, the Navy “has limited authority” to intervene in business affairs.
It’s a conundrum of the military's own making.
HANDING THE KEYS TO CONTRACTORS
Two decades ago, the Defense Department warned that widespread disrepair in base housing “runs the risk of collapsing the force because the most dedicated service members will decide to leave.”
Congress passed legislation authorizing the military branches to transfer ownership of base housing – now valued at $8 billion – into new public-private ventures that would replace substandard homes with new or renovated units and manage them for the next five decades.
The program can point to noteworthy upgrades: 80,000 new homes have been built and 50,000 units renovated on bases nationwide over the past two decades, the department said.
Still, the military’s contracts with industry leave enlisted families largely to fend for themselves against some of the country’s largest landlords. Many have no other option: Moving costs for deposits and advance rent easily reach thousands of dollars. That can be a stretch on a military salary. Marine corporals, for instance, earn base pay of $2,089 to $2,536 a month.
The DOD says military base families have the same protections as civilian tenants, and the contracts require landlords to provide safe housing. But base officials have limited enforcement power. That power is delegated higher up the chain of command and rarely used.
Families in base homes “receive the same level of protection as in civilian housing,” said Scott Forrest, assistant commander of asset management at the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, which runs the privatized housing program for the Navy and the Marines. Under the business agreements, however, the landlord is solely responsible for addressing problems in day-to-day operations, he said. There, the command has “a limited role.”
The Defense Department was told three years ago by its own Inspector General’s office it has a problem with unsafe housing. It decided not to act.
A spot check of bases by the Inspector General found “pervasive” health and safety deficiencies. These included electrical and fire hazards, lead-based paint and “unmitigated mold growth.”
The office recommended the Pentagon step up inspections and increase oversight of privatized housing. But defense officials rejected the recommendations. They would “unnecessarily increase costs” and “impose more government intrusion into a private business enterprise,” the DOD said in its official response.
Asked about that decision, the Defense Department said it is committed to providing quality housing for families. The Pentagon and the military branches “continue to work together to review housing conditions, to address health and safety hazards and to evaluate policies and procedures to ensure that any health and safety issues are addressed,” spokeswoman Heather Babb told Reuters.
She said service members can choose to use their housing allowance to live off base – 70 percent do. Competition with civilian housing “incentivizes” military contractors “to maintain quality housing to attract and retain tenants,” Babb said.
MOLD, MUSHROOMS AND LAWSUITS
Two of the most widespread hazards families face on bases are rodents and mold. Across the United States, tenants at six bases told Reuters of their struggles with mice. Complaints of mold were even more widespread, with families at 20 bases describing outbreaks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says humans can catch three dozen diseases from mice and rats: directly, by touching the animals or their feces, urine or saliva; or indirectly, through tics and other insects that feed on infected rodents.
At Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Kimberly Strauf and her Army officer husband battled cockroaches, a leaking ceiling and mice scattering throughout their base home in 2016 and 2017. “They are in our ventilation system through our air vents, peeing and pooping everywhere,” she said. The final straw: when Strauf spotted a mouse in her baby’s bassinet. Soon after, housing operator Michaels Management Services moved them into a new home. The company said it “thoroughly” addressed the issues.
Mold, the CDC says, triggers coughing, wheezing and inflammation of air sacs. In people with weakened immune systems, it can cause serious lung infections. Mold grows where moisture builds, often due to leaks, poor construction or lack of ventilation. Remediation requires eliminating the water source and replacing infested materials.
The risk is serious enough that the Defense Department halted construction on its new, $1.3 billion strategic command headquarters in Nebraska in 2015 after finding mold in the ventilation system. It ordered the contractor to immediately replace 10,000 linear feet of ductwork.
The Pentagon has been slower to address mold in service members’ homes, Marine and Navy families say.
Several families living in Lincoln homes on Camp Pendleton shared letters from family doctors urging housing officials to investigate. One child “has been in to the office 7 times with respiratory related illnesses,” a doctor wrote of a 3-year-old. “I am concerned that the mold in the home is a contributing factor.”
That was May 2017. The pediatrician followed up that November, noting the same child had contracted repeated sinus and lung infections requiring antibiotics. When a reporter visited this August, the mold was still there, coating the walls, furniture, toys, shoes and clothing. A month later, after the doctor’s urging, the family moved out.
""MARCHING ORDERS""
Brigadier General Kevin J. Killea, the commanding general at Camp Pendleton, confirmed the mold problem and said he gave “marching orders” that Lincoln remediate the family’s belongings and that “nothing should come out of the residents’ pocket.” Lincoln said the ocean air, not the home, was to blame.
Last year, the Marines asked a DOD consultant to identify resident concerns at Camp Pendleton and other West Coast Marine bases. The report, which has not been released, concluded tenants were “generally satisfied” but wanted better quality control over maintenance and other issues, a Marine spokesman said. The landlords agreed to add staff and improve communication.
When there are problems, the commanders at Camp Pendleton don’t necessarily have the authority to solve them. Pendleton has a Marine housing office with a staff of five that serves as liaison between families and Lincoln. But it “doesn't have enforcement powers over the business agreement,” said camp spokesman Carl B. Redding Jr.
CEO Bliss said he does not consider mold a widespread problem, even as Lincoln acknowledged it responds to about 3,000 mold complaints a year nationwide. That’s one complaint for every 12 homes it runs.
One trouble spot is the area near Norfolk, Virginia, where Lincoln manages more than 4,000 homes at seven Navy bases clustered in the state’s Tidewater region. More than a dozen Norfolk-area military families contacted Reuters with concerns about mold.
Federal records show the company spent more than $13 million from 2013 to 2016 on maintenance and litigation related to mold in the Norfolk area alone. Since 2010, at least 14 families from bases in the area have sued Lincoln over allegations they were sickened by mold. Lincoln lost the only case to go to trial. Twelve others were resolved – Bliss declined to say if they were settled – and one is pending.
Lincoln also settled a lawsuit over mold at Camp Pendleton for an undisclosed sum. And it’s fighting another mold lawsuit by a family that lived in San Diego Navy base housing.
“We have undertaken robust reviews of our processes and procedures,” Bliss wrote in response to questions about mold at Lincoln’s properties around the country. He said the company would have an outside expert review those procedures “to ensure we are using best-in-practice measures.”
TOXIC BLOOMS
Mold isn’t a new problem for Lincoln. In the Norfolk area, the company faced a PR nightmare over a mold outbreak several years ago. Some families say problems persist long after the attention faded.
In 2011 and 2012, residents complaining of mold blooms appeared regularly on local news station WTKR, attracting members of Congress to public hearings. At first, Lincoln called the allegations “falsehoods.” Under pressure from Congress, the company provided free mold inspections for 848 homes in 2012.
Seventy-seven percent of the tested homes underwent mold remediation, according to the Naval Facilities Engineering Command. Those numbers were not publicly disclosed at the time; the Navy recently provided them to Reuters.
Among those affected: U.S. Marine gunnery sergeant Joe Federico and his wife, Shelley, who sued the company in 2012 over mold exposure they said made them and their daughter sick.
During the lawsuit, a Lincoln lawyer told the judge a report by an environmental testing firm found no mold contamination. On the eve of trial in February 2016, the Federicos’ legal team learned the report had been edited by a Lincoln lawyer, who removed a recommendation to lower spore levels in the home. Lincoln failed to disclose another report that undermined its defense: It found elevated spore levels and recommended remediation.
A jury awarded the Federicos $350,000. The couple appealed, seeking a larger award, and settled for an undisclosed amount in October 2016. Lincoln said the original judgment was a fraction of the millions the family sought.
At the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, Cece Sickles said mold surfaced in the master bathroom of her Lincoln home in November, growing from a speck to a blanket. She and her husband, a chief petty officer, have four children, ages 1 to 16. “I have a baby who’s possibly breathing in this stuff,” she said.
Lincoln replaced the ceiling in late 2017. This year, in early August, Sickles showed an employee a moist, black substance on the living room wall around the air vents. He told her it was “just dust,” she said, and wiped it off.
When a reporter visited later that month, the growth had returned, covering the inside of the vents and surrounding wall. Bright orange stains bloomed on the hall bathroom’s walls. Reuters provided the family with mold test kits. The results, analyzed by a certified lab, showed the substance was mold.
The couple pressed Lincoln to reinvestigate. A contractor confirmed extensive mold and the company moved the family out while replacing the heating and cooling systems, bathroom and part of the garage. Beth Baker, a spokeswoman for the Navy’s Mid-Atlantic region, said Lincoln “moved quickly” to resolve the problem.
Reuters tested two other area homes where Lincoln had denied the presence of mold. Those results also came back positive. Lincoln later remediated both homes.
LEAVING THE CORPS
Some Marines have concluded the only way to protect their families is to retreat.
At Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Sergeant Ethan Andrews and his wife, Stephanie, were desperate for help. Their duplex roof leaked on and off for more than a year. Mold bloomed in the walls, photos taken by the couple show. Mushrooms sprouted from carpets so wet their toddler Gavin learned to walk in rain boots: His baby pictures show him climbing the stairs in bright blue rubbers.
“The house smelled like a sewer,” Stephanie said. “Friends quit coming over.”
She and Gavin developed chronic coughs, she said, and Ethan suffered from severe headaches. Water eventually burst through the ceiling and flooded the living room.
They complained to Lincoln, which blamed the family dog for a puddle on the floor, she said. An employee told her the mushrooms were “totally normal.” The furry black matter under their baseboards? “They told us it was glue.”
Concerned for their son’s health, the couple decided to move off base early last year. They asked to be let out of their lease four months early.
Lincoln VP Rizzo told Reuters the roof leaks were due to unusually heavy rain and the company had to repair them multiple times. Other area homes had similar problems, he said. Even so, the company agreed to let them out of their lease, he said.
The Andrews tell a different story: Lincoln staff said they would have to pay a $3,000 penalty – enough to bankrupt them. They could appeal the charge, but the final decision would take up to six weeks.
So Ethan, who had served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, took the only sure way out: He left the Marines – a change in status that exempted him from the fee but ended his military career.

“We had to leave,” Stephanie said. “My son was sick. We had no choice.”

HANOI (Reuters) - In a rare ideological denunciation of one of its members, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party has publicly criticized a prominent and outspoken academic for publishing translations of books it said were critical of socialism and one-party rule.
Chu Hao, a former vice minister of science, is accused by party investigators of abusing his position as director of an academic publishing house to produce Vietnamese translations of the offending volumes.
""Documents and evidence collected by the party's Central Inspection Commission revealed that Comrade Hao has deteriorated in his political ideology, morality and lifestyle,"" said a statement on the commission's website, published on Wednesday.
Despite presiding over sweeping reforms and an increasingly open market-orientated economy, the Communist Party of Vietnam tolerates little criticism.
Hao ""seriously violated party discipline"" by criticizing the party's monopoly on power and describing its attempts to build a market economy alongside socialism as ""unrealistic"", the statement said.
As an outspoken critic of the party, Hao had largely escaped punishment because of his family's closeness to founding president Ho Chi Minh, and his positive contributions to Vietnam's science and technology sector.
From 2005-2009, the statement said, Hao's publishing house released Vietnamese translations of books which contained content that was ""politically and ideologically wrong"".
According to the Central Inspection Commission, those books included translations of Friedrich Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom"", which warns against the dangers of the state's control over the means of production, and an introduction to Karl Marx by Australian philosopher Peter Singer.
All of the books cited in the statement were no longer available on Hao's publishing house website as of Thursday.
It is not clear why Hao is being targeted now - although the party investigation comes amid an intensified crackdown on political dissidents in Vietnam.
It also follows the merging of the general secretary and presidential roles in the Southeast Asian country. 
Nguyen Phu Trong, a 74-year-old party ideologue who has also presided over the crackdown on corruption, became the first leader since Ho Chi Minh to hold the two titles when he was made president last month.
""He deliberately committed his violations despite being reminded not to do so,"" the statement said of Hao's continued publishing of works viewed as wrong by the party. 
""It can therefore be concluded that his violations were deliberate and systematic"".

179,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Japan still has no Iran sanctions waiver after talks with U.S. officials,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has not yet been granted a waiver from Washington's plan to reimpose sanctions to cut Iran out of international markets, even after several rounds of talks with U.S. officials, the Asian nation's top government spokesman said on Thursday. 
The Trump administration has said it is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil on a case-by-case basis. The renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran are set to come into effect on Nov. 5. 
""Japan-U.S. talks have been conducted four times so far on U.S. sanctions on Iran,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. 
""The Japanese side has asked that the impact would not affect the activities of Japanese companies. I'd like to refrain from further comments on the details of the talks."" 
U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran's crude exports to strain Tehran, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil.
India also hopes to secure a waiver, as it has significantly cut Iranian oil imports ahead of the deadline, officials there said last month.
A Japanese oil market analyst who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said the chances for Japan winning a waiver would increase if India was granted one. 
The Japanese government and industry officials were hopeful of winning an exemption, said the analyst. 
A senior Japanese trade ministry official on Thursday declined to provide any further details. 
Japan joined South Korea in temporarily halting Iranian oil loadings, but three of Iran's top five customers – India, China, and Turkey - are resisting the call to end purchases outright, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Japan imported about 172,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude last year, down 24.2 percent from 2016, and accounting for 5.3 percent of total, trade ministry data showed.
Japan has cut Iranian imports significantly from nearly 315,000 bpd in 2011, the year before the previous international sanctions on Iran were imposed. 
Japan won waivers from the previous sanctions that allowed it to buy limited amounts of oil from Iran before the restrictions ended in 2016.

GUATEMALA CITY/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Cocaine production is beginning to creep into Central America, a development which could bring the supply of the drug closer to the United States and create a new security risk for an already troubled region.
Guatemala made its first official discovery of a field of coca plants this May following the initial find of a plot in Honduras last year. Two more followed in Honduras this year.
""We aspire to have control of our territory, but it's very difficult to root out these actions,"" Jaime Quintanilla, head of the anti-drug trafficking unit in Honduras, told Reuters.
At around 50 hectares in total, the four coca finds were a tiny fraction of the 171,000 hectares under cultivation in Colombia last year, according to Reuters interviews with local officials and official Colombian data.
Honduras and Guatemala, together with El Salvador, are among the poorest and most gang-ravaged countries in the Americas. Mass migration from the region to the United States has created tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Quintanilla said the fields cultivated in Central America were trials by cartels to explore saving transportation costs and reducing the risks of moving the product from Colombia or other major cocaine-producing countries like Bolivia and Peru.
Authorities expect more to follow.
""This is going to continue,"" a Guatemalan police official said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Detection is difficult in Guatemala, where some mountain regions have barely been charted, he said. 
It took an anonymous tip and a 10-hour trek through the Guatemalan jungle for police to find 75,000 coca plants in May across less than hectare of land in an area known as Alta Verapaz, the official added.
Guatemala's government declined comment on the coca finds, as did the U.S. embassies in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Hot and humid, Alta Verapaz is straddled by mountains up to 2,500 meters high, similar to the Andean parts of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) basin where cultivation of coca is most widespread.
Honduras and Guatemala are short of funds, plagued by corruption and have little experience in tracking coca cultivation, making their large tracts of inaccessible land ideal for drug traffickers looking for new hideaways.
""Colombia has teams of eradicators moving around the country ... and laws to restrict import and commercialization of chemical precursors needed to convert coca leaf into cocaine,"" said James Bargent, an analyst at InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organized crime. ""Honduras has none of that.""

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Suspected members of the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency killed at least 15 people in an attack on a group of villages in northeast Nigeria late on Wednesday, residents told Reuters.
The villages lie on the outskirts of the militarized city of Maiduguri, the heart of government in the northeast and the headquarters of efforts to defeat Boko Haram and the related Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) insurgency. The conflict has lasted almost a decade.
Despite the Nigerian government's statements since late 2015 that Boko Haram has been largely defeated, the militancy is still able to attack in and around Maiduguri and throughout much of the northeast.
In the village of Kofa, a Reuters reporter counted five bodies burned inside the remains of their house. A village chief in nearby Dalori said one person in the camp for displaced people had been killed, while two residents of Bulabrin said nine people had died there.
Nigeria's military said in a statement one civilian was found dead, after Boko Haram had ransacked Dalori's market, setting buildings ablaze and fleeing when soldiers approached.

The appointment of Meaza Ashenafi comes two weeks after Abiy named 10 female ministers to make Ethiopia the third country in Africa - after Rwanda and Seychelles - to have its cabinet split equally between men and women.
A prominent rights campaigner, Meaza recently served as an adviser on women's rights at the Addis Ababa-based United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
Naming her as his pick to head the Supreme Court, Abiy told lawmakers the court system needed improved capacities ""to successfully implement demands made with regards to justice, democracy and change in our country.
""I have made the nomination with the firm belief that she has the capacity required, with her vast international experience in mind."" 
Parliament unanimously approved Abiy's choice.
Under Ethiopia's constitution, the court system operates independent of government. 
Last week the Horn of Africa country named Sahle-Work Zewde as president, also the first woman to hold that post.
Since his appointment in April, Abiy has presided over a series of reforms that have included the pardoning of dissidents long outlawed by the government and diplomatic overtures to long-term enemy Eritrea.
But they have so far failed to curtail unrest with over two million people displaced this year due to clashes - many pitting different ethnic groups against each other - in several parts of the country.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will sit down to unprecedented talks with the opposition on Thursday to discuss installing a caretaker government ahead of December's election, a key demand of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
The BNP, in disarray after the jailing of its chief, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, on corruption charges, stayed away from the last parliamentary election in 2014 when that demand was not met.
That election was marred by widespread violence that killed hundreds of people and disrupted the impoverished South Asian country's economic mainstay, the $30 billion-a-year export-driven garment industry.
BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the formation of an interim government was necessary to ensure a ""level playing field"".
""We will also ask for the release of our chief Khaleda Zia and demand the deployment of the army to ensure smooth voting,"" Alamgir told Reuters.
Alamgir said the party still hoped Khaleda, whose jail term was doubled to 10 years on Tuesday, a day after she was jailed in another graft case for seven years, would be released and be able to lead the opposition coalition of 20 parties, the National United Front.
They had not lined up an alternative candidate for prime minister, he added.
The attorney-general has ruled out her taking part in the election.
Hasina and Khaleda, who between them have ruled Bangladesh for decades, are bitter rivals and the BNP says its leader has been jailed on trumped up charges to keep her out of politics.
The government and Hasina's Awami League deny the accusation and say the courts are independent.
Anisul Huq, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, declined to comment on the agenda for the talks.
Mohammad Abdur Rashid, the executive director of the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in Dhaka, said the meeting had raised hopes of a comparatively peaceful election for Bangladesh, which has attracted international attention for hosting tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees from neighboring Myanmar.
""People don't want anarchism like in the previous election,"" Rashid told Reuters.
Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Marcia Bernicat on Tuesday called the meeting a positive development.

""All sides must avoid violence,"" she said. ""Violence hinders the democratic process.""

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The avowed anti-Semite accused of opening fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue and killing 11 worshipers is scheduled to appear in federal court on Thursday, as three more victims of the massacre are laid to rest. 
Funerals will be held for Sylvan Simon, 86, his wife, Bernice, 84, and for Richard Gottfried, 65, who were killed on Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill district in the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.
The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, 46, will be arraigned on a 44-count grand jury indictment that includes 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder, one count for each worshiper killed. 
Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Bowers, who also faces hate crime and firearm charges. 
Bowers is accused of bursting into the synagogue and opening fire with a semi-automatic rifle and three pistols in the midst of Sabbath prayer services as he shouted ""All Jews must die.""
Six people, including four police officers, were wounded before the suspect was shot by police and surrendered.
The attack, following a wave of pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democrats, heightened national tensions days ahead of elections on Tuesday that will decide whether U.S. President Donald Trump loses the Republican majority he now enjoys in both houses of Congress.
The Pittsburgh massacre also fueled a debate over Trump's rhetoric and his self-identification as a ""nationalist,"" which critics say has fomented a surge in right-wing extremism and may have helped provoke Saturday's bloodshed.
The Trump administration has rejected the notion that he has encouraged white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have embraced him, insisting he is trying to unify America even as he continues to disparage the media as an ""enemy of the people.""
Mourners had gathered on Wednesday for the funerals of Melvin Wax, 88, who was leading Sabbath services for one of the temple's three congregations when the attack began; retired real estate agent Irving Younger, 69; and retired university researcher Joyce Fienberg, 75. 
On Wednesday, the after-effects of the tragedy pervaded life in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, where the synagogue is located.
In coffee shops, customers talked about the victims they knew, remembering them as civic-minded, kind and pillars of the community. In the street, friends embraced and comforted one another during the period of raw grief.
Libby Zal said that Younger was such a fixture in Squirrel Hill that a local store he frequented would send him a ""get well"" card if he was absent for a few days.
Dan Frankel, a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, called Younger outgoing and opinionated.

""He was very interested in social justice and he probably would not have wanted the death penalty (for the gunman),"" Frankel said.

Turkey launched Euphrates Shield in 2016 to drive away Islamic State militants and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from its border with Syria. Ankara regards the U.S.-backed YPG as a terrorist organization. The operation ended in 2017.
Turkey hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees who fled the conflict in their homeland. Some Turks view them as an economic burden and a threat to jobs.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - China's restrictive internet policy and digital surveillance has spread worldwide over the last two years, with its government training emerging market countries on process and its companies furnishing the tools, a democracy watchdog group's annual report says.
Freedom House, whose main financier is the U.S. government, said in its report on Wednesday that China's export of ""digital authoritarianism"" had become a major threat to sustaining democratic governance in some countries.
Freedom House research director Adrian Shahbaz said that governments had begun justifying increased censorship and diminished digital privacy protections by saying the policies combat the spread of fake news and help catch criminals.
In effect, countries are using the curbs to violate human rights, he said.
Freedom House said China has been leading the charge. It has hosted seminars on cyberspace management since early 2017 with representatives from 36 out of 65 countries tracked by Freedom House, including nations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The 65 countries represent 87 percent of the world's internet users, the group said.
Discussions with Chinese officials preceded new cybersecurity measures in Vietnam, Uganda and Tanzania over the last year, Freedom House said after reviewing Chinese state media articles and government press releases.
Meanwhile, Chinese technology companies have provided or are set to provide internet equipment to at least 38 of the tracked countries and artificial intelligence systems for law enforcement in 18 countries, the report said.
""Beijing has been on a clear charm offensive to woo government officials and media elites,"" Shahbaz said. ""Officials in Beijing hope to cultivate allies to follow its lead on global internet policy.""
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the accusations made in the report were ""unprofessional and irresponsible"" and had ""no foundation in fact"". He didn't elaborate.
To be sure, declining internet freedom has been a consistent global trend for nearly a decade. And Chinese foreign investment and influence efforts are not new.
But Freedom House said the threat to human rights has grown in severity as powerful technology becomes more accessible to governments and their people.
As fake news on social media has become a deadly problem, governments are using it as an ""opening wedge for censorship,"" Michael Chertoff, the group's chairman and a former U.S. secretary for Homeland Security, told reporters by phone.
Thirteen countries, including Rwanda and Bangladesh, prosecuted people this year for allegedly spreading false information, Freedom House said.
Chertoff said governments should emphasize digital hygiene education and called on multinational firms to take a stand against governments going too far.

Freedom House senior officials said they were dismayed that the United States under President Donald Trump had emboldened attacks on democratic media and limited net neutrality, adding to the global trend.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's iconic Red Flag, the vehicle of choice of former revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, is going hands-free.
Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) said on Thursday it would launch a fully autonomous passenger car next year in a partnership with Hongqi, or Red Flag, the car brand long favored by China's political elite.
Hongqi, owned by carmaker China FAW Group Corp Ltd, is widely regarded as a symbol of China's early communist revolutionary elite, including Mao and Deng Xiaoping, who rode the luxury sedan in the 1960s and 1970s.
Baidu, often seen as China's equivalent to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, said it will produce a limited number of fully automated level four Hongqi vehicles in 2019 for a pilot operation, before wider release in 2020.
Level four means they require no human intervention during autonomous driving in most conditions, said Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li and FAW Chairman Xu Liuping at an event held to announce the plan.
Baidu has previously unveiled fully autonomous buses and trucks, but the Hongqi car marks a major push into self-driving vehicles for public use. The car it showed off on Thursday was white sports utility vehicle with a large sensor on its roof.
The tech firm is leading the charge in China's effort to build autonomous cars with strong backing from the Chinese government, which named Baidu - whose main business is internet search - as one of four national champions in artificial intelligence (AI).
The company is also working with several of China's largest cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, to develop autonomous driving infrastructure and public smart transport technology.
Baidu's announcement comes as Google's autonomous driving project Waymo is set to begin testing fully autonomous cars on California's roads after earlier trials in other parts of the United States.
Baidu has also reached an agreement to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Chinese-owned Volvo Cars, and announced a tie-up with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday to test self-driving vehicles on Chinese roads.
China's industry ministry has unveiled plans to become a world leader in several AI technologies, including autonomous driving, in the next decade. 
The Hongqi marque has undergone several revamps over the decades, falling out of favor for a period in the 1980s, but more recently being revived amid a national push to promote Chinese brands. It has also created an electric concept car.

President Xi Jinping rode a Hongqi car during recent military parades and last month a Hongqi car was used to transport Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a rare state visit.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 03:59AM ET</span>",Traitors or Russian agents? Clergy caught in Ukraine church row,"By Matthias Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Pavel Polityuk
KIEV (Reuters) - Priests like Metropolitan Oleksandr face a choice: join Ukraine's new independent church and be labeled a renegade by supporters of his own church, or stay away, and risk being branded a Russian agent.
It is a decision facing thousands of clerics as Ukraine prepares to sever ties to the Russian Orthodox Church going back to 1686. 
For the Ukrainian authorities it is an essential step to tackling Russia's malign influence on its soil, four years after Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people.
It may also help President Petro Poroshenko, who championed the split, shore up support in a tight election race next year. 
But the move is opposed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church, which compared it to the Great Schism of 1054 that split western and eastern Christianity.
Metropolitan Oleksandr, a member of the traditionally dominant Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), wants to join the new church because of what he calls its poisonous association with the Russian state.
""We love Russians, we love Russia, but we don't love those who have unleashed a war on the part of Russia and who are feeding it today,"" he said in an interview. 
He echoes critics who call his church a tool used by Moscow to justify Russian expansionism and support the separatists.
Oleksandr compares setting up the new church to removing a diseased body part by surgery. ""The surgical method is painful, but it must be done in the end in order for the body to begin to recover,"" the 41-year-old said. 
His stance comes at a price. 
The Moscow Patriarchate has labeled those wanting to join the new church as ""schismatics"". A high-ranking official, Metropolitan Antoniy, said joining the new church would be a betrayal. 
In May, the Moscow Patriarchate censured Oleksandr for ""obscene"" behavior and told him to stop making public statements that could lead his followers into temptation. 
Separately a video, watched more than 100,000 times on YouTube, called him a ""traitor"" and portrayed him as corrupt, soft on gay rights and involved in the abduction of two nuns. 
Oleksandr, who regularly puts up photos and videos of his services on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), reposted the video to his 12,000 followers to show what his opponents were up to.
POLITICAL GAME
Ukraine in October secured approval to set up an independent church from the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, the global spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians.
The next step is for Ukraine's various church strands to meet to decide the make-up of the church and who will lead it. 
The Russian Orthodox Church retaliated by breaking off all ties with Istanbul and accused the United States of engineering the split behind the scenes. President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday warned of ""painful consequences"".
Patriarch Kirill of Moscow called the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's support for an independent Ukrainian church ""shameless"". 
He said Orthodox unity could be preserved only through the ""resistance of our people, our clergy, our episcopate, to every mean trick, to every heresy, to every schism"".
Ukraine and Russia trace their Orthodox Christian roots to Volodymyr the Great, the prince whose baptism in 988 in Kiev led to the christianization of the region known as the ""Kievan Rus"".
The Moscow Patriarchate, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, earlier dominated in Ukraine but has been challenged by a rival known as the Kiev Patriarchate formed after the 1991 break-up of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union.
Support for the Kiev Patriarchate swelled after the annexation of Crimea. It supports church independence and Ukraine's closer integration with the West.
Oleksandr estimates between 40-70 percent of Moscow Patriarchate churches will join the new church, though his parishioners have mixed views. Some support it, while others, like Anna Trofimova, oppose it as a ""political game"".
Archbishop Kliment, spokesman for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), said in an interview that only a tiny fraction of his church's believers wanted to switch across.
Asked about the attacks on Oleksandr, Kliment said his church was itself the victim of a smear campaign.
As an example, he cited Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin's statement that his church had no place in Ukraine and suggested it root out Russian agents in its ranks. 
Kliment said support for independence had not risen but the authorities were pushing for it ""because in six months there will be presidential elections.""

ANTWERP/PARIS (Reuters) - For years, they heard little from daughters who went to join Islamic State. Now dozens of families across Europe have received messages from those same women, desperate to return home from detention in Syria.
They are among 650 Europeans, many of them infants, held by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias in three camps since IS was routed last year, according to Kurdish sources. Unwanted by their Kurdish guards, they are also a headache for officials in Europe.
In letters sent via the Red Cross and in phone messages, the women plead for their children to be allowed home to be raised in the countries they left behind.
In one message played by a woman at a cafe in Antwerp, the chatter of her young grandchildren underscores their mother's pleas.
Another woman in Paris wants to care for three grandchildren she has never met, born after her daughter left for Syria in 2014, at the age 18. ""They are innocent,"" she said. ""They had no part in any of this.""
Like other relatives of those held in Syria, the two mothers asked to remain anonymous - afraid of being linked to IS and worried their daughters may face reprisals.
The United States has taken custody of some citizens, as have Russia and Indonesia, and wants Europe to do the same - fearing the camps may breed a new generation of militants.
""We are telling European governments: 'Take your people back, prosecute them. ... They are more of a threat to you here than back home,'"" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said.
Europe is largely reluctant: there is little sympathy for militants' families with the trauma of deadly attacks still fresh in many capitals, and European diplomats say they cannot act in a region where Kurdish control is not internationally recognized. 
For the children it may be that their fate is determined by which country their mother came from.
The Kurds say it is not their job to prosecute or hold them indefinitely, leaving the women and children in legal limbo.
""Absolutely nobody wants them,"" said a senior diplomat grappling with the issue. ""How can you sell to the public that you are proactively helping the families of your enemies?""
However, mounting concern over abandoning hundreds of children with a claim to EU citizenship - most of them under six - is pushing governments to quietly explore how to tackle the complexities of bringing them back.
""The threat emanating from children of the caliphate is really an unprecedented, invisible and very complex one - one that we have to deal with right now,"" Robert Bertholee, head of the Dutch AIVD intelligence agency, said earlier this year.
""These children are victims above all.""
French officials have said they will work to repatriate the children - but not their mothers. Other EU nations are in talks with Kurdish authorities, two European intelligence sources said, but these are complicated because the Kurds want governments to take back all their nationals - not just the young. [nL8N1X23ZT] 
""About the children we all agree but not on the parents,"" a senior European security source said.
LETTERS HOME
The Red Cross collected about 1,290 messages for families in visits to the Al Roj, Al Hol and Ain Issa camps where the women are held this year. The camps are in an area of Syria under Kurdish control following the defeat of Islamic State in nearly all territory it once held in Syria and Iraq.
""Mummy, Papa, forgive me for everything,"" one 23-year-old wrote, adding little hearts to the margins of the page provided. ""I've lived unimaginable things,"" she scribbled. ""I want to be with you and never leave.""
The women paint a grim picture: tuberculosis is rampant while food, baby milk and medical care are in short supply. Some women have died.
""There is no capacity; keeping them there is not a long-term viable option,"" said Nadim Houry, director of Human Rights Watch's counterterrorism program, who has visited some camps. 
""You don't build counterterrorism policy on public opinion.""
Kurdish officials say the foreigners in their custody comprise 900 IS fighters, 500 women and more than 1,000 children. As coalition forces clear remaining pockets of IS territory, Western security sources say numbers will grow.
They fear the camps will not hold them long. Kurdish forces have traded some women back to IS fighters in exchange for prisoners and let others go.
While women made up almost 20 percent of 5,900 Western Europeans who joined IS - and they had at least 566 babies abroad, a report by the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalism found, few have returned.
 
LEGAL GREY ZONE
Families in Belgium, France and the Netherlands are suing governments to intervene to get their relatives home.
One mother has been petitioning authorities since receiving a letter on March 30 from her daughter - one of at least 20 Belgian women in the camps.
""I've tried everything,"" she said, meeting with other mothers from around the country to share sorrows over tea and cupcakes on a recent Saturday in Antwerp. ""We have no voice. We are branded the parents of terrorists.""
Calling their cause the Mothers' Jihad, they plan to joint legal action after one of their group lost a case to repatriate six grandchildren - all under 5 years old - by her daughter and step-daughter from camp Roj.
The judge ruled that although Belgium had a moral duty under the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child to do so, it could not be enforced in the stateless war zone.
""I am broken,"" their grandmother said after the ruling. 
In the Netherlands, lawyers for three of about 35 women in the camps won a small victory. Judges ruled the government should bring them to stand trial where they would otherwise be prosecuted in absentia over their role in IS.
As long as Dutch authorities do not act, their trials are frozen. ""It is a political decision,"" a government official said. ""Other countries are taking steps to bring people back."" 
In France, lawyers say the absence of an official government stance on at least 60 French women and 150 children in camps has made it difficult to bring cases to court. ""We have been met with a scornful silence,"" said Martin Pradel, who represents several families.
'DENIAL AND PANIC'
The children are seen both as victims and threats, so bringing them back to schools and homes in Europe is fraught with difficulties.
""I understand the sensitivities in countries that suffered from terrorist attacks; still we hope to facilitate humane solutions for kids,"" said Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC.
But DNA testing to confirm claims of nationality may not be possible when parents are dead. IS widows often remarried, complicating custody issues. And separating children from their parents breaches international humanitarian law.
""The debate must stop oscillating between denial and panic,"" said Muriel Domenach, who leads efforts against radicalization in France, where some 78 children of militants who fled IS have been taken in charge by the state. ""These are neither kids like any other, nor are they time bombs."" 
When French psychiatrists first see their young charges, they are in a state of shock from being separated from their mothers at the airport. ""They are in a terrible state when we see them,"" said Thierry Baubet, who is treating 40 children as part of the program set up by French authorities last year.
With their returning mothers in pre-trial detention, the children are placed with foster families - many of whom are at a loss on how to handle their trauma and have begun attending a support group set up by psychiatrists.
Mostly the children are too young to understand the stigma of IS or how their words may alarm neighbors, teachers and social workers.

""They talk about bombs. They talk about fathers who passed away,"" Baubet said. ""They talk about the Islamic State all the time.""

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Islamist protesters blocked roads in Pakistan's major cities for a second day on Thursday, opposing a Supreme Court decision the previous day to acquit a Christian woman on death row for blasphemy allegations, media said.
Knots of protesters from an ultra-Islamist party blocked roughly 10 key roads in the southern city of Karachi and others in eastern Lahore, Geo TV and other channels said. Private schools in both cites were shut, as well as in the capital.
Groups of about 200 protesters from the Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party sat under large tents, listening to speeches on two blocked roads in Karachi, a Reuters witness said.
In one speech, a TLP speaker exhorted supporters to light new fires if the police managed to douse burning tires and other objects they had already set ablaze.
The demonstrators were protesting against the court's decision to free Asia Bibi, a mother of four, who had been living on death row since 2010, as the first woman sentenced to death by hanging under Pakistan's tough blasphemy laws.
Bibi was accused of making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
But a three-judge panel set up to hear the appeal, headed by Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, ruled the evidence was insufficient.
The case has divided Pakistan, where two politicians who sought to help Bibi were assassinated, and outraged Christians worldwide, with Pope Francis saying he personally prayed for Bibi.
In a televised national broadcast late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Imran Khan warned the protesters the government would act against any prolonged blockade.
""We will not allow any damages. We will not allow traffic to be blocked,"" Khan said. ""I appeal to you, do not push the state to the extent that it is forced to take action.""
Khan's broadcast followed comments by a senior leader of the Islamist TLP group, calling for Chief Justice Nisar and the other two judges to be killed.
""They all three deserve to be killed,"" TLP co-founder Muhammad Afzal Qadri told a protest in Lahore. ""Either their security, their driver, or their cook should kill them."" 
He also called for the ouster of Khan's new government and urged army officers to rise up against powerful military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
Hafiz Saeed, an influential Islamist whom the U.S. accuses of being the mastermind of attacks in Mumbai in 2008 that killed 166, has called for protests after Friday afternoon prayers. 
Another Islamist group, the Milli Yakjehti Council, is also meeting on Thursday to discuss Bibi's case and may launch protests.

The whereabouts of Bibi and her family are unclear, and speculation is growing that she will leave Pakistan with her family, who have been in hiding for much of the past eight years.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Afghan forces struggle to regain ground as casualties mount: report,"By Rupam Jain
KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan government is struggling to recover control of districts lost to Taliban insurgents while casualties among security forces have reached record levels, a U.S. watchdog agency said on Thursday.
The latest quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) underlines the heavy pressure on the government in Kabul even as the United States has opened initial contacts with the Taliban on possible peace talks.
""The control of Afghanistan's districts, population, and territory overall became more contested this quarter,"" the agency said.
The Taliban have still not succeeded in taking a major provincial center despite assaults on Farah in western Afghanistan and Ghazni in the center this year but they control large stretches of the countryside.
Data from Afghanistan's NATO-led Resolute Support mission showed that government forces had ""failed to gain greater control or influence over districts, population, and territory this quarter"", the agency said.
As of September, it said the government controlled or influenced territory with about 65 percent of the population, stable since October 2017, after a year of heavy fighting in Farah and Ghazni as well as other provinces like Faryab and Baghlan in the north.
However, it reported only 55.5 percent of the total 407 districts were under government control or influence, the lowest level since SIGAR began tracking district control in 2015.
""While the districts, territory, and population under insurgent control or influence also decreased slightly, the districts, territory, and population 'contested' — meaning under neither Afghan government nor insurgent control or influence —increased,"" it said.
Six months before presidential elections, the figures are a sign of the degraded security situation in Afghanistan, even as the U.S. special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, has met Taliban officials to map out possible peace talks.
As the Taliban have kept up pressure on the government, SIGAR quoted the Resolute Support mission as saying the average number of casualties among Afghan security forces between May 1 and Oct. 1 was ""the greatest it has ever been during like periods"".
The Afghan government no longer releases exact casualty figures but this month General Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said Afghan casualties were increasing from last year and were an issue ""we are paying very, very close attention to"". 
On Sept. 24, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said that while he could not confirm reports that about 500 police and soldiers had been killed and 700 wounded over the previous month, the figures ""sound about right"".
The Taliban are fighting to expel foreign forces and defeat the Western-backed government in Kabul.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",South Korea Supreme Court allows conscientious objection to military service in landmark ruling,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Supreme Court said on Thursday that conscientious objection is a valid reason to refuse mandatory military service, a landmark change in the court's decades-long stance that is expected to impact about 930 pending cases. 
The full-bench decision overturns about five decades of precedents that punished conscientious objectors for refusing mandatory military service and is in step with changing South Korean attitudes as relations with North Korea thaw.
The court's decision concerned only one defendant, a 34-year-old man surnamed Oh, a Jehovah's Witness whose trial court guilty verdict was upheld at the appellate court. 
Through decisions in 1969 and 2004, South Korea's Supreme Court had maintained that religious beliefs or conscience were not valid reasons to refuse mandatory military service. 
South Korea's Military Service Act says that if a conscripted person refuses ""without valid reason"" the person is to be given jail time of up to three years. 
Some 930 cases are currently in court concerning alleged violations of the Military Service Act, according to Jarrod Lopes, spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses' world headquarters. 
There were signs of a change in attitude toward mandatory military service earlier in the year, with South Korea's Constitutional Court in June ruling that the current law -- which does not specify alternatives to military service -- does not align with the country's constitution. There was also a number of ""not guilty"" verdicts in lower courts for conscientious objectors. 
In a survey of 527 men eligible for mandatory military service, conducted from May this year, 38.8 percent said that those in alternative service, such as serving as industrial workers or a public health doctor, can be regarded as servicemen as long as they live in camps during the period, said the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. 
The defense ministry said earlier this year it will gradually shorten periods of mandatory military service by 2-3 months until 2022, from 21 months to 18 months for army servicemen. 
South Korea, which is still technically at war with North Korea, is one of the few countries that has mandatory conscription for all men as a rule. 
However, a recent thaw between relations has resulted in an inter-Korean military pact signed in September, with the two Koreas agreeing to halt military drills, set up a no-fly zone near the border and gradually remove landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarized Zone, among other steps.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:52PM ET</span>",Sex abuse by officials 'endemic' in North Korea: rights group,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - Sexual abuse by officials in positions of authority in North Korea appears to be ""endemic"", a watchdog group reported on Thursday, as activists complain the isolated country's rights record is being ignored amid an international push to improve relations.
Investigators with U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) interviewed more than 60 North Koreans who had left the country and described unwanted sexual contact and violence as ""so common that it has come to be accepted as part of ordinary life"".
Gathering information in North Korea is notoriously difficult, and HRW acknowledged its survey was too limited to provide a generalized sample.
But the testimonies of those involved paint a picture of sexual abuse - including rape - that is so widespread that many of the women interviewed did not always understand that coercive sex should not be an almost every day occurrence, said one investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the work.
The #MeToo movement has pushed for an end to sexual abuses around the world, but HRW executive director Kenneth Roth said there appears to be little progress in North Korea, despite economic reforms and a stated intention to modernize the country under leader Kim Jong Un's authoritarian government.
""This is not a regime-threatening issue,"" Roth told Reuters. ""So that is why it is particularly appalling that the government is not doing anything to prevent sexual abuse by officials.""
Those interviewed described sexual abuse and rape by police, prison guards, and even officials who oversee some of the growing private markets in the country who exact bribes in the form of sexual favors.
""Ironically, many of the women who are at the center of the economic opening that Kim says he cares about are the most at risk,"" Roth said. 
A report on sexual violence in North Korea released in March by the Korea Future Initiative also found that ""a thinly disguised misogyny pervades all that the government touches, allowing perpetrators to find shelter in its institutions and society’s patriarchal conventions"".
The North Korean Permanent Mission at the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment, but state media has released a steady flow of commentaries this year, warning that taking issue with human rights could undermine the detente.
As Seoul and Washington focus on diplomatic outreach to North Korea, however, human rights and North Korean defector groups in South Korea have said they are struggling to raise money, cutting jobs and programs, and facing pressure to avoid criticism of Pyongyang.
U.N. investigators have reported the use of political prison camps, starvation and executions in North Korea, saying security chiefs and possibly even Kim Jong Un himself should face international justice.

Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are held in political prison camps, the U.N.'s top North Korea rights official reported last year.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:51PM ET</span>","No-fly zone, military drill ban near Korea border take effect","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A no-fly zone and a ban on military drills near the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea came into effect on Thursday as the once uneasy neighbors push to further defuse tensions.
The measures were part of a military accord inked during last month's inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, which includes a halt in ""all hostile acts,"" and a gradual removal of landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). 
The United States has raised concerns that the deal could undercut defense readiness amid tardy progress on North Korea's denuclearisation, though it displayed support at an annual security consultative meeting of defense ministers on Wednesday in Washington. 
""The South and the North completely removed dangers of military clash through the military agreement,"" South Korea's President Moon Jae-in told the parliament on Thursday.
""The two Koreas and the United States will achieve complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and lasting peace based on firm trust."" 
North Korea has also taken steps toward the pact, such as covering artillery deployed along the skirmish-prone western shore, Seoul's defense ministry said. 
The no-fly zone extends 40 kms (25 miles) north and south from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) in the east and 20 kms (12 miles) in the west for fixed-wing aircraft.
The agreement also bars live-fire drills involving fixed-wing aircraft and air-to-ground guided weapons in the no-fly area. South Korea and the United States had held such drills regularly until halting joint exercises in June.
There are different restrictions on helicopters, drones and balloons, with exemptions for commercial and non-military operations such as medical, disaster and agricultural uses.
""We will thoroughly verify the North side's implementation of the agreement, including its movement on military exercises around the MDL and whether it complies with the no-fly zone,"" the South's defense ministry said in a statement. 
The no-fly zone was a key sticking point for Washington because it would effectively bar close air support drills, in which airplanes provide firepower for troops who may be operating near enemy forces.
The allies agreed to halt the Vigilant Ace air defense drills set for December in a move to spur nuclear talks with Pyongyang, while South Korea said it kicked off two military exercises on Monday outside the banned area.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearisation during his historic June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. But Pyongyang's actions have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and materials.
South Korea's spy agency said North Korea was preparing for international inspections at some of its nuclear and missile test sites, the Yonhap news agency said on Wednesday.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he planned to meet his North Korean counterpart next week.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Just three years after being voted out in a presidential election in Sri Lanka, strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa is back at the center of power, appointed prime minister by the man who defeated him.
President Maithripala Sirisena named the pro-China 72-year-old as his number two on Friday after abruptly dismissing the government of incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe has said his removal is unconstitutional and has demanded he be allowed to prove his parliamentary majority.
A mustachioed man usually dressed in a spotless white shirt, sarong and trademark maroon sash, Rajapaksa is seen as a hero by many in Sri Lanka's Buddhist majority. He wears rings as lucky charms, sometimes as many as eight, and he has been called the ""lord of the rings"". 
Rajapaksa has been accused by diplomats of serious human rights abuses in the war against rebels from the Tamil minority, one of Asia's longest-running conflicts that ended during his tenure as president, in 2009. More than 100,000 people were killed in the 26-year war.
Rajapaksa said in a statement after he was sworn in he wanted to end religious and ethnic divisions in the country of 21 million people.
""We will eschew the politics of hate and set up an interim government that will protect the human rights of all citizens, that will protect the independence of the judiciary and establish law and order in the country,"" he said. 
Almost immediately after he was sworn in, supporters of Rajapaksa invaded state media outlets in Colombo to take control of them, journalists there told Reuters. 
Reporters Without Borders has called Rajapaksa ""one of the world's biggest press freedom predators"" during his two terms as president from 2005 to 2015. 
Mavai Senathirajah, a legislator from the main Tamil political party, said it was a shock to the community that makes up 13 percent of the population that Rajapaksa was back in power in three years.
""There are a number of accusations against him including war crimes. The president who accused Rajapaksa of corruption and rights abuses during the last election now has appointed him as his prime minister.""
FAMILY AFFAIR 
Born into a family of nine siblings in the southern village of Weeraketiya, Rajapaksa has spent four decades in politics, along with many of his relatives.
A lawyer by training, he followed his father into parliament in 1970, then the youngest-ever legislator, while several of his brothers and sons have held key roles in domestic and international politics. 
His son Namal, a London-educated lawyer, took his record as the youngest MP in 2010. 
Earlier in his career, Rajapaksa was known as a strong defender of human rights and participated in many left-wing and radical protests. 
Before becoming president in 2005, he held a number of ministerial portfolios, and served as leader of the opposition from March 2002 until he was appointed prime minister in 2004. 
He soon turned his attention to the civil war, boosting troop numbers and pushing into territory held by the Tamil Tiger rebels, leading to their surrender in 2009 and a landslide election win for Rajapaksa the year after. 
The United Nations has said that thousands of civilians were killed in the last year of the war after heavy shelling by government forces. It has long sought a judicial investigation involving foreign judges and prosecutors to probe the alleged war crimes.
In a leaked diplomatic cable written in 2010, the United States' ambassador to Sri Lanka Patricia Butenis said that responsibility for alleged crimes against civilians during the war ""rests with the country's senior civilian and military leadership, including President Rajapaksa and his brothers"".
Rajapaksa's brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was Defence Secretary during the final stages of the war, has faced allegations he maintained death squads.
The brothers rejected the allegations and said the military only targeted the Tamil Tigers, one of the most violent insurgent groups in the world at the time. 
SECOND TERM 
After winning a two-thirds majority in his second term in 2010, Rajapaksa amended the constitution to remove checks on the presidency, including the presidential two-term limit. 
Rajapaksa is also known for drawing the country closer to China, borrowing billions of dollars from Beijing to the alarm of Sri Lanka's traditional ally India. 
He opened up the country's main port to Chinese submarines when he was president, which stoked anger in India, while a huge new port funded by Chinese investment led to concerns Beijing's investment program was a debt trap. [nL3N1X94AG]
Rajapaksa blamed the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing for rallying his opponents against him, leading to his loss in the 2015 election. 
His return to power has drawn concern in New Delhi that China would tighten its grip on Sri Lanka, which is strategically placed at the head of the Indian Ocean.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 10:23PM ET</span>",'Shines with the color of pearls': Myanmar's trade in human hair booms,"By Aye Min Thant
YANGON (Reuters) - Hair helps to pay the rent for Za Za Lin, whose eyes filled with tears as her long black mane was combed, cut, and untangled by practiced hands at a roadside market stall in Myanmar's commercial hub of Yangon.
""It only hurts a little,"" said the 15-year-old, as hair buyer Zin Mar handed over the equivalent of $13 for the 20 inches (51 cm) of hair she sheared off, roughly the minimum weekly wage in Myanmar.
""It was time to pay the rent,"" she said.
On the other side of the world, the hair, processed and repackaged as ""raw Burmese hair"", will sell for hundreds of dollars to consumers clamoring for wigs and extensions made from the sought-after material.
Long hair is esteemed as a mark of beauty and has deep religious meaning in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where monks and nuns shave their heads as a sign of humility. 
""People from all over the world want hair from our country, because when you shampoo and condition it, it shines with the color of pearls,"" said Win Ko, a 23-year-old who buys hair from individuals and small suppliers such as those at the market.
Although the trade in human hair dates back centuries, only in the last decade or so, as Myanmar has opened up to the outside world, have its people begun to grasp the economic opportunity.
The country formerly known as Burma now sits at the heart of a multi-million dollar industry. Since 2010, it has quadrupled the volume of hair it ships each year to become the world's fourth largest exporter, the United Nations says.
In 2017 alone, Myanmar earned $6.2 million from the export of hair equivalent to the weight of 1,160 average-size cars.
The trade has drawn in thousands who source, process, and export hair, whether from desperate people like Za Za Lin or bought by the kilo in the form of dusty hairballs.
Once gathered, the hair travels from vendors to factories to be untangled, combed, washed, and repackaged before being shipped, mostly to China, to become extensions and wigs.
Firm numbers are hard to come by in the largely unregulated industry, but Min Zaw Oo of Tet Nay Lin, a hair trading business started in the mid-2000s, says he sells mostly to black women in Britain, Nigeria, South Africa, and the United States.
""This is our market: black people."" 
A recent YouTube search for ""Burmese hair"" returned thousands of videos of women reviewing wigs and extensions.
""It's not as silky as Indian hair, and it's not as coarse as Brazilian hair. But it's a little bit in the middle,"" said a beauty blogger, 'MakeupD0ll', who boasts more than 600,000 followers and earns up to $900 from some of the wigs she makes. 
COLORED, PERMED AND SHORT
But the demand for Burmese hair is outpacing supply as modern fashion trends make it harder to source long, straight and chemically unaltered product, said two vendors huddled around market stalls in Yangon's Insein district. 
""Hair is colored, permed, and short now,"" said Hmwe Hmwe, 44, who has spent 13 years in the business.
Vendors say April, the time of the Myanmar new year, is their best month, when many women preparing to become nuns sell their hair before it gets ritually shaved.
Much of the hair exported from Myanmar is not freshly cut, but swept up from waste instead. One business owner, who goes by the name 'Auntie Cho', said she bought ""hair from the comb"", which has fallen out naturally. 
She pays about 55 cents per ounce of hair, stuffed into plastic bags for family and neighbors to untangle and comb into bundles she sells to middlemen.
Among them is Win Ko, who loads the hair on a truck for a drive of several hours to Myanmar's border town of Muse, where about a dozen Chinese traders wait.
""You just pick and choose one you like and he arranges for you to sell to Chinese buyers,"" said Win Ko.

Sensing Za Za Lin's sadness at losing her hair, the buyer, Zin Mar, the owner of Thiha Hair Purchasing and Sales, offered sympathy. ""It's like getting paid to get a haircut,"" she said.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 09:32PM ET</span>",Peru opposition leader Fujimori ordered back to jail by judge,"LIMA (Reuters) - A judge on Wednesday ordered Peru's opposition leader, Keiko Fujimori, returned to jail pending a trial over allegations she used her conservative party to launder money for Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
The daughter of a former president, Alberto Fujimori, and a twice-defeated presidential candidate, Keiko Fujimori has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and described the prosecution's efforts to imprison her as ""political persecution.""
Fujimori, 43, spent a week in police custody earlier this month before being released on appeal.
But Judge Richard Concepcion of the National Criminal Court on Wednesday ruled Fujimori and her associates had sought to obstruct the Odebrecht probe, and granted prosecutors' request to jail her for up to three years to ensure they could work freely.
""Preventive prison,"" or pre-trial detention, is common in Peru, though critics say it is used excessively.
Fujimori's attorney told the court she would appeal.
Dressed in black with her hair in a ponytail, Fujimori hugged her husband and appeared to be holding back tears. 
""We hope this arbitrary and disproportionate decision can be corrected,"" Ursula Letona, a lawmaker in Fujimori's Popular Force party, said on broadcaster ATV+.
Clashes between dozens of Fujimori's supporters, her critics and police erupted outside the courtroom after the decision was announced, according to images on TV channel Canal N.
Fujimori's legal woes have crippled her once-powerful party - potentially ending the political turmoil that has loomed since the 2016 elections over the world's No. 2 copper producer and one of Latin America's most stable economies.
Popular Force used the congressional majority it won in 2016 to help topple former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in March, and had recently been turning up the pressure on his successor, President Martin Vizcarra.
But as the prosecution last week detailed its evidence against Fujimori in a widely-watched hearing, Popular Force called for an end to the ""political war."" The party's top leaders - except Fujimori - have stepped down, internal divisions have erupted publicly and one Popular Force lawmaker admitted he was an informant for prosecutors.
Vizcarra has ignored public pleas from Popular Force representatives for a private meeting with him to discuss legislation.
Prosecutors accuse Fujimori and her associates of laundering $1.2 million for Odebrecht, which has admitted to bribing politicians across Latin America.
After Brazil, Peru is the country where the Odebrecht scandal has been most disruptive - fueling the kind of anger at political elites that helped propel radical former Army captain Jair Bolsonaro to Brazil's presidency.
Fujimori denies ever taking money from Odebrecht. 
Three years in jail would put Fujimori out of the 2021 presidential race - though she would have the right to run a campaign from prison if she still has no convictions.
But Fujimori may be released on appeal before then.
In early October, a separate court revoked a pardon that had freed Alberto Fujimori from prison for human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 government. He has been in hospital since the ruling.

In April, Peru's Constitutional Court in April also freed former president Ollanta Humala halfway through the 18 months he was ordered to spend in jail before trial, finding it had violated due process.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",PDVSA ex-executive admits taking bribes in guilty plea in U.S. court,"By Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - A former finance executive of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA accepted $17 million in bribes as part of a broad embezzlement scheme, U.S. federal prosecutors said on Wednesday, in a case that implicates a French oil firm and a Russian bank.
The former executive, Abraham Ortega, admitted to taking the bribes as part of a guilty plea to one count of attempting to launder $12 million of the illegal payments, the U.S. Attorneys' Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of Florida said in a statement.
The case comes amid growing U.S. investigations into the troubled OPEC nation's public officials, and may lead to new revelations about the role of foreign firms in graft probes that until now have mainly focused on Venezuelan nationals.
""Ortega admitted that he and his co-defendant laundered $12 million through a sophisticated false-investment scheme,"" reads the statement, which describes a ""billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from PDVSA.""
PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Ortega accepted $5 million from a French oil company and from a Russian bank, according to the statement, which did not name either company.
Prosecutors said that in exchange, Ortega helped companies gain ""priority status"" to loan money to joint ventures in which they were partners with PDVSA.
That was beneficial to those companies because PDVSA had agreed to speed up the flow of cash coming out of the joint ventures, which had slowed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, if the companies made the loans, the statement said.
PDVSA in 2013 said it had signed a deal with Russia's Gazprombank for $1 billion in financing for a joint venture between the two companies called Petrozamora.
Gazprombank did not respond to an email seeking comment.
In 2014, then-Petroleum Minister Rafael Ramirez announced a $420 million loan from Anglo-French oil company Perenco to boost output at the Petrowarao joint venture.
Perenco declined to comment. 
Ortega obtained $12 million through a PDVSA embezzlement scheme built around the country's exchange control system, which for years has allowed well-connected public officials to buy subsidized dollars and resell them at a huge profit.
More than a dozen people have pleaded guilty as part of a broad Justice Department investigation into bribery at PDVSA that became public in 2015 with the arrest of U.S.-based contractors Roberto Rincon and Abraham Shiera.
The government of President Nicolas Maduro has described the U.S. investigations as politically motivated, and accuses Washington of seeking to undermine his government through financial sanctions.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Mexico Supreme Court says ban on recreational marijuana unconstitutional,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that an absolute ban on recreational use of marijuana was unconstitutional, effectively leaving it to lawmakers to regulate consumption of the drug.
Announcing it had found in favor of two legal challenges filed against prohibition of recreational marijuana use, Mexico's top court crossed the threshold needed to create jurisprudence: five similar rulings on the matter.
That creates a precedent other Mexican courts will have to follow.
""This is a historic day,"" Fernando Belaunzaran, an advocate of drug reform and member of the opposition leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said.
The Supreme Court made its first ruling to allow a group of people to grow marijuana for personal use in November 2015.
In a statement, the court said the ruling did not create an absolute right to use marijuana and that consumption of certain substances could still be subject to regulation.
""But the effects caused by marijuana do not justify an absolute prohibition on its consumption,"" it said.
The court ordered federal health regulator COFEPRIS to authorize people seeking the right to use marijuana to do so personally, ""albeit without allowing them to market it, or use other narcotics or psychotropic drugs.""
Congress would now have to act to regulate the use of marijuana in Mexico, Belaunzaran said.
Officials in the incoming government of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have indicated they could take steps to legalize marijuana quickly as part of a broader strategy to fight poverty and crime.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - A federal grand jury on Wednesday charged the man accused of killing 11 worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue with additional hate crimes and firearms offenses, as the Jewish community held more funerals for victims of the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.
The 44-count grand jury indictment expands on the charges initially brought against avowed anti-Semite Robert Bowers, 46, after Saturday's massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill district.
""Today begins the process of seeking justice for the victims of these hateful acts,"" U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said in a statement, adding that his office ""will spare no resource"" in doing so.
The fresh charges account for surviving victims of the massacre, including police officers. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. 
Bowers is accused of bursting into the synagogue and opening fire with a semi-automatic rifle and three pistols in the midst of Sabbath prayer services as he shouted ""All Jews must die.""
Eleven of the mostly elderly congregants were killed, and six people, including four police officers, were wounded before the suspect was shot by police and surrendered.
The attack, following a wave of politically motivated pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democrats, heightened national tensions days ahead of elections on Tuesday that will decide whether U.S. President Donald Trump will lose the Republican majority he now enjoys in both houses of Congress.
The Pittsburgh massacre also fueled a debate over Trump's inflammatory political rhetoric and his self-identification as a ""nationalist,"" which critics say has fomented a surge in right-wing extremism and may have even helped provoke Saturday's bloodshed.
The Trump administration has rejected the notion that he has encouraged white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have embraced him, insisting he is trying to unify America even as he continues to disparage the media as an ""enemy of the people.""
Mourners gathered on Wednesday for the funerals of Melvin Wax, 88, who was leading Sabbath services for one of the temple's three congregations when the attack began; retired real estate agent Irving Younger, 69; and retired university researcher Joyce Fienberg, 75. 
The after-effects of the tragedy pervaded life on Wednesday in the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the heart of its Jewish community, where the synagogue is located.
In coffee shops, customers talked about the victims they knew, remembering them as civic-minded, kind and pillars of the community. In the street, friends embraced and comforted one another during the period of raw grief.
Libby Zal said that Younger was such a fixture in Squirrel Hill that a local store he frequented would send him a ""get well"" card if he was absent for a few days.
Dan Frankel, a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, called Younger outgoing and opinionated.
""He was very interested in social justice and he probably would not have wanted the death penalty (for the gunman),"" Frankel said.
EXPANDED CHARGES
Wednesday's indictment, like the criminal complaint preceding it, charged Bowers with 11 counts of obstructing free exercise of religion, resulting in death, and 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder - one count for each worshiper killed 
It added 15 criminal counts total, including new hate-crime charges pertaining to the wounding of two worshipers and the use of dangerous weapons against a dozen police officers, including the four injured in a gunfight with the suspect.
Funerals for the first four victims to be buried were held on Tuesday as Trump paid a low-key visit to Pennsylvania's second-largest city, stopping briefly at Tree of Life and the hospital where the wounded officers are recovering.
His trip was greeted by thousands of protesters, who staged a boisterous but peaceful march and rally near the synagogue, demanding Trump publicly denounce white nationalism. 
Trump made no public comments during his visit, but wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning that his office had been ""shown great respect on a very sad and solemn day"" in Pittsburgh.
""Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away,"" he tweeted. ""The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!""
Four days after the attack, nerves in Squirrel Hill were still frayed. A public school was briefly placed on lockdown following a report that someone had brought a gun onto campus, police said. The report was later found to be false.
Jodi Smith, a Pittsburgh native, joined mourners ahead of the Wax funeral at the Ralph Schugar Chapel and remembered him as a ""very polite, gentle man.""
""I could have claimed him as a father,"" Smith said. ""The synagogue had been his life since his wife passed away a few years ago.""
Fienberg spent 25 years as a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center until she retired in 2008. 

""She was an engaging, elegant, and warm person,"" the center said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

202,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",China birth rate set to continue decline this year: China Daily,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's birth rate is set to decline further this year as well as over the next few years, despite the country's 2016 move to relax its controversial ""one-child policy"", the China Daily newspaper said on Thursday, citing population experts.
Though China's birthrate hit its highest level since 2000 in 2016, it fell 3.5 percent last year, and regional data suggests the number will fall even further this year, the newspaper said, citing Zhai Zhenwu, an expert in population studies at China's Renmin University.
Zhai said births in Jiangsu province in eastern China, one of the country's most populous regions, had declined 12.8 percent in the first half of 2018, and surveys of hospitals in southwest China's Sichuan province also show significantly fewer births this year. 
Growing concerns about the country's rapidly aging population prompted a move by China in 2016 to allow all couples to have a second child, relaxing restrictions on childbirth in place for nearly four decades.
In a sign that it would further relax curbs, China's health commission said in September that it would abolish family planning offices. Reports earlier this year claimed the country was planning to scrap all limits on the number of children a family can have by the end of this year. 
China's elderly population is expected to reach 400 million by the end of 2035, up from around 240 million this year, putting the country's health services and pension funds under immense strain, according to data published last year by the China Association of Social Security, a research group.
The northeast rustbelt province of Liaoning said earlier this year that it would consider offering incentives to couples to have more children. While its net population is dwindling, Liaoning's elderly population grew 3.6 percent last year.

Lopez Obrador, set to take office on Dec. 1, on Monday said he would heed the results of public consultation that called for abandoning the current project and instead converting a nearby military air base for commercial use.
The decision pummeled the peso and Mexican stocks and generated uncertainty over the fate of multi-million dollar contracts. 
But Hermes and ICA said their meeting was positive, although they did not say whether they would work on the alternative project, building two runways at the military air base in the town of Santa Lucia in Mexico state.
""It went very well,"" Alberto Perez Jacome, director of Hermes Infrastructure, said after the meeting. ""We are very happy that there are already mechanisms in place, working groups, and we are certain they will act in accordance with the law.""
For its part, ICA said that despite the decision to cancel the project, the company is open to bidding for new contracts during Lopez Obrador's six-year term in office.
""We are going to work on all the infrastructure projects that are of interest to the new government,"" ICA Chief Executive Guadalupe Phillips said. 
Lopez Obrador's administration has suggested that contractors for the original project could work on the Santa Lucia plan, but legal experts say contracts cannot simply be transferred from one project to another.
""The contracts are tailor-made,"" said Juan Francisco Torres Landa, managing partner of the law firm Hogan Lovells in Mexico City. ""The other project would have to go through a new procurement process.""
Lopez Obrador argued during the campaign that the new airport was tainted by corruption and would be expensive to maintain due to the complexity of the terrain. 
Construction on the project began three years ago and is roughly a third complete.
U.S. engineering firm Parsons, which is managing the project, said it would adapt to the new conditions.
""Parsons' job is to implement our customer's vision of the project in the best way possible. If that vision involves change, we will respond with agility and will use our expertise to bring our customer's plans for the program into fruition,"" Parsons Senior Vice President Perfecto Solis said in a statement.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada rushes to deport asylum seekers who walked from U.S. - data,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is prioritizing the deportation of asylum seekers who walked across the border from the United States illegally, federal agency statistics show, as the Liberal government tries to tackle a politically sensitive issue ahead of an election year.
The number of people deported after their refugee applications were rejected was on track to drop 25 percent so far this year compared to 2017 to its lowest point in a decade, even as the number of deported border-crossers was on track to triple, according to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) data.
More than 36,000 people have walked into Canada from the United States to file refugee claims since January 2017, many saying they feared U.S. President Donald Trump's election promise and policy to crack down on illegal immigration.
The influx has thrown the Canadian asylum system into turmoil and caused a political uproar in a country accustomed to picking and choosing its newcomers.
In response, the government gave more money to the independent body adjudicating refugee claims and appointed a minister responsible for border-crossers.
The CBSA, which is responsible for deportations, said in an email to Reuters that it classifies border-crossers with criminals as a top deportation priority.
Refugee lawyers and border officers said the prioritization seems to be Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's way of dealing with those asylum seekers, who have become a hot political issue for his Liberal Party ahead of a general election in 2019.
Border Security Minister Bill Blair declined to comment.
In an email, Blair's office said the government is committed to a ""robust and fair"" refugee system and that everyone ordered removed has been given due process.
A CBSA inland enforcement officer said the tradeoff is that deportees who could pose a real public safety risk are not getting deported. 
""We have priority cases, people with extensive criminal records that are due to be deported, people with security problems - these cases are not all taken care of because we have to take care of these administrative cases,"" said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media.
Border-crossers ""are not a priority, but they are a priority because of all the media attention around them.""
A CBSA spokesman said in an email that the agency prioritizes ""irregular"" failed refugee claimants along with criminals as a top priority, followed by other failed refugee claimants, but would not say why.
Six lawyers told Reuters they were aware of this acceleration of certain cases, some saying they have had border-crosser hearings scheduled in blocs, with a focus on those from Haiti and Nigeria. 
Toronto lawyer Lorne Waldman said there were good reasons for accelerating the processing and deportation of people who crossed the border: it deters people with weak claims from making refugee claims in the hopes of living in Canada for years while their case wends through the system. 

""The best way of discouraging people from making frivolous claims is by having the claims processed quickly,"" Waldman said.

The North African country has two governments, the U.N.-backed administration in Tripoli and a rival one based in the east, part of an ongoing power struggle since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
There is a House of Representatives (HoR) based in the east and a consultative body State Council backed by lawmakers from a previous assembly.
Both agreed to work toward a unified Presidential Council (PC) made up of a president, two deputies and a prime minister ""to end (the) division,"" HoR lawmaker Abdulsalam Nusia said on Twitter, posting a joint statement.
Spokespeople from the HoR and the State Council confirmed both sides had signed the agreement.
""The project to reform the executive branch and unify state institutions is a national project to end the division in the country,"" the statement said.
Tripoli is home to a Presidential Council headed by Prime Minister Fayez Seraj but it is not recognized by the east.
The United Nations, which has been trying to mediate between the two sides to prepare the country for elections, gave a cautious welcome.
U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame ""received an update on the progress achieved in the political talks between the two bodies and received a joint document of PC restructuring mechanism,"" its Libya mission said in a statement.
Unifying state bodies would be a step forward, but questions remain whether militias and armed groups will accept a deal since they benefit from the country's chaos.
Tripoli's government is backed by several armed groups while in the east Khalifah Haftar has emerged as key commander of his LNA troops.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Austria and Hungary's decision to turn their backs on a U.N. agreement on how to manage migration is bizarre and mistaken, U.N. Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was approved in July by all 193 U.N. member nations except the United States, which pulled out last year. 
Hungary quit in July, and on Wednesday Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said his country would not join either. Poland is considering leaving too.
Arbour, a former U.N. human rights chief, said it was regrettable to see departures because the whole U.N. had managed to find common ground, and Austria - an active participant in the negotiations - should be comfortable with the text and could easily express any reservations that remained. 
""What I also find frankly a bit disappointing is that a lot of reasons that are advanced for disengaging are either mistaken or do not reflect what this global compact is all about,"" Arbour said. 
The compact was non-binding and in no way infringed state sovereignty, and suggestions in Austria that it might lead to a ""human right to migrate"" were unfounded, she said. 
""This is coming out of nowhere, it’s nowhere in the document, it’s nowhere on the table.""
The compact was a framework for cooperation like the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of targets for improving global well-being by 2030, and it would be ""bizarre"" for countries to declare they were ditching that agreement, she said. 
The impetus for the compact came after Europe's biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two triggered fear of foreigners and nationalist tensions.
Arbour said the compact did not affect states' rights to manage their borders, but simply sought to instil order into cross-border movements.
""One of its main objectives is to reduce, if not to eliminate altogether, unsafe, chaotic, illegal poorly managed migration, which is in nobody’s interest - not the migrants, not the host communities, not the countries of origin,"" she said.

""So it’s not that migration is a good thing or a bad thing. It’s a thing that’s been with us forever, and cross-border human mobility will be forever with us, but currently some of its poorly managed aspects are a source of genuine concern.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday rejected criticism that deploying thousands of troops to the border with Mexico was a political stunt.
""The support that we provide to the secretary for homeland security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police, so we don't do stunts in this department,"" Mattis said after a meeting with his South Korean counterpart at the Pentagon.
Several groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have accused President Donald Trump of politicizing the military ahead of next week's midterm elections.
Trump has hardened his stance on immigration ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections. He has drawn attention to a caravan of migrants that is trekking through Mexico toward the United States as he seeks to fire up support for fellow Republicans in campaign battles with Democrats who are trying to wrest control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
Republican lawmakers and other Trump supporters have applauded the deployment. But critics say Trump is politicizing the military, deploying them as a stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls without any real national security threat.
""The move to send 5,200 active duty troops to the southern border is a craven political stunt that sets a bad precedent and is arguably an abuse of power,"" Kelly Magsamen, a former senior Pentagon official, said. She is currently with the Center for American Progress think tank.
The deployment will create an active-duty force comparable in size to the U.S. military contingent in Iraq.
Trump's decision to call in the military appears to be a departure from past practice. At least in recent years, such operations were carried out by National Guard forces, largely part-time military members often called upon in response to domestic emergencies.
A U.S. official told Reuters that as of Wednesday the Pentagon had identified about 7,000 active-duty troops, which included about 2,000 on standby, that could be deployed to the border with Mexico if needed.
On Tuesday, the top U.S. general overseeing a deployment of more than 5,200 troops to the border said troop levels would rise further, but declined to say how high or estimate what the operation will cost.
Many basic questions remained unanswered days after the Pentagon announcement, including the scope of the mission as well as the Pentagon's assessment of any threat posed by arriving migrants.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The outcry in the United States demonizing Saudi Arabia over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul threatens U.S.-Saudi strategic ties, the former Saudi intelligence minister warned on Wednesday.
""We value our strategic relationship with the United States and hope to sustain it. We hope the United States reciprocates in kind,"" royal family member Prince Turki bin Faisal al Saud said in an address to the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, a non-profit advocacy organization.
Turki, to whom Khashoggi once served as an adviser, has also served as an ambassador to London and Washington. His speech denouncing what he called ""the demonization of Saudi Arabia"" clearly carried Riyadh's imprimatur, as he heads an Islamic research center named after his father, the late King Faisal.
Turki's address came after Istanbul's chief prosecutor on Tuesday said that Khashoggi was suffocated in a premeditated killing and his body was then dismembered.
Khashoggi, who lived in self-imposed exile in the United States, wrote columns for the Washington Post critical of the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Some U.S. lawmakers have accused the crown prince of ordering Khashoggi's death - a charge that Riyadh denies - and threatened sanctions. U.S. commentators have strongly condemned the kingdom.
Recalling that more than 70 years of U.S.-Saudi ties survived previous crises, Turki said, ""Nowadays, this relationship is once again threatened.""
""The tragic and unjustified"" slaying of Khashoggi ""is the theme of today's onslaught and demonization of Saudi Arabia in the same fashion as the previous crises. The intensity and gleefulness of it is equally unfair,"" he said. ""Subjecting our relationship to this issue is not healthy at all.""
Turki reiterated that the kingdom is committed to bringing to justice those responsible for Khashoggi's murder ""and whoever else failed to uphold the law.""
The Trump administration is demanding full accountability from Riyadh in Khashoggi's death. In what it called a first step, it revoked the visas of some Saudi officials implicated in the slaying.
The U.S.-Saudi relationship ""is too big to fail,"" Turki said.

Those ties, he noted, transcend oil production, trade, arms sales and investment to cooperation on Middle East peace efforts, stabilizing oil markets, fighting extremism and containing Iran, the kingdom's main regional foe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States was engaged in a ""multi-pronged effort ... to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce"" and respect international law after Washington indicted 10 Chinese nationals for stealing aviation secrets.
Speaking in a radio interview, Pompeo called China's behavior in stealing intellectual property ""inappropriate"" and ""not consistent with being a superpower or a leader in the world.""
""Stealing another country’s intellectual property, something China’s been engaged in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, is just something China has to figure out a way to stop,"" he told the Brian Kilmeade Show.
Pompeo also told the Laura Ingraham radio show that over the long term, China was probably the biggest national security challenge facing the United States and the Trump administration was pushing back ""on all fronts.""
""Where the semiconductor piece fits in is it’s part of a mosaic of our strategic effort to push back against this continued Chinese effort,"" he said.
""It is a multipronged effort on behalf of all of the United States Government, at the President’s direction, to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce and with respect to the rules of international law,"" he said.
A U.S. indictment unsealed on Tuesday said Chinese intelligence officers conspired with hackers and company insiders to break into computer systems of private firms to steal information on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners.
It was the third major corporate espionage-related case involving Chinese intelligence officers brought by the Justice Department since last month and comes at a time when Washington is embroiled in a major trade war with Beijing. 
The United States and China have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods over the past few months, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's demands for an end to alleged Chinese intellectual property theft, deep cuts to industrial subsidies, and action to correct a major U.S. trade deficit with China.
Early this month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence intensified Washington's pressure campaign against Beijing by accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine Trump ahead of next Tuesday's congressional elections and reckless military actions in the disputed South China Sea, a major Asian trade route.

China has rejected the charges.

The United States is preparing to impose the new sanctions on Iran's oil industry after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal between Tehran and other global powers earlier this year, but is also considering offering waivers to some allies that rely on Iranian supplies.
""We want to achieve maximum pressure but we don't want to harm friends and allies either,"" Bolton said in a talk at the Hamilton Society.
Bolton said the administration understands that a number of countries, some close geographically to Iran which he visited last week, and others ""may not be able to go all the way, all the way to zero immediately."" It was a more conciliatory tone about the sanctions from Bolton, a proponent of being tough on Iran and winding down its crude exports to zero.
Still, Bolton said that consequences can already be seen in Iran including the collapse of the rial, its currency. ""I think it's important that we not relax in the effort,"" he said.
In a presidential memorandum addressed to secretaries of State, Treasury and Energy, Trump said he determined there was sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products elsewhere than Iran to permit a reduction in purchases from the Islamic Republic.
Under the law, the U.S. president must periodically issue a ""determination"" on whether there is sufficient supply in the market from non-Iranian sources for countries to significantly cut their Iranian purchases.
The administration's renewed sanctions are set to come into effect on Nov. 5.
Under U.S. law, Washington can sanction the financial institutions of foreign countries that fail to significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil and petroleum products.
The purpose of the law, which came into effect during the Obama administration, was to put pressure on Iran to curtail its nuclear program by forcing its major oil customers to reduce their purchases.
Three of Iran's five largest buyers of crude - China, India and Turkey - have resisted calls by Washington to end their oil purchases outright.
This week South Korea asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for ""maximum flexibility"" on its request for a waiver to prevent companies there from being hit by the sanctions. Other countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan, depend on some imports from Iran.

The administration has said it is considering waivers on a case-by-case basis.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro set about staffing up his new administration on Wednesday, naming an astronaut as science minister as a top anti-corruption judge mulled a job offer.
Bolsonaro won the presidential race on Sunday, easily overcoming his leftist opponent with a vow to kneecap violent drug gangs and end years of political graft. He has also said he wants to roughly halve the size of the presidential cabinet.
Bolsonaro, who nearly died from a stab wound while campaigning last month, donned a bulletproof vest on Wednesday and headed to the beach in Rio de Janeiro to attend an acrobatic air show in his honor.
The former army captain said on Twitter that Marcos Pontes, a Brazilian astronaut who was the country's first person in space, would be his science and technology minister. 
A full cabinet will be announced next month, Bolsonaro's future chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni said in a private meeting, according to two people who heard the remarks.
On Thursday, Bolsonaro is due to meet with crusading anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro, who led the so-called ""Car Wash"" probe snaring big names in Brazil's political class and opening the door for Bolsonaro's tough-on-corruption campaign. 
Bolsonaro has previously said he wants Moro to serve as his justice minister and eventually join the Supreme Court. The court's next vacancy is expected in 2020.
A columnist for Estado de S. Paulo reported on Wednesday that Moro will accept an offer from Bolsonaro to run the justice ministry with expanded powers over corruption and public safety, without citing a source. 
However, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Moro had not yet made up his mind.
A third person said his conditions included the passage of new anti-corruption legislation and expansion of the justice ministry's responsibilities to include the federal police and the auditing office that roots out graft in the federal budget.
Moro, who oversaw graft investigations culminating with a 12-year bribery and money laundering sentence for leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been cautious in public statements.
""In the event I'm indeed offered a post, it will be subject to a balanced discussion and reflection,"" Moro said in a statement on Tuesday.
As part of his drive to slim down government, Bolsonaro has proposed combining three existing ministries into the portfolio of his chief economic adviser and folding together the ministries of agriculture and environment.
The first idea has faced resistance from industrial leaders and the latter has been criticized by the outgoing heads of the ministries. 
""How will a minister of agriculture comment on an oil field or mineral exploration?"" current Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said in a statement. 

Current Environment Minister Edson Duarte released a statement warning the move could ""overload the ministry with so many and such varied agendas it would threaten Brazil's role in global decision-making forums.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will remove child refugees from its remote Pacific detention centers within weeks, a senior diplomat said, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison seeks to secure support for his government, which looks set to become a minority administration.
Canberra's hard-line immigration policy sees asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia sent for processing to camps in Papua New Guinea and on the South Pacific island of Nauru.
While aid agencies have called for the removal of the more than 1,000 refugees held for more than five years, Morrison is under immense pressure to resettle 40 children currently held on Nauru amid warnings they are suffering from declining mental health.
Detailing the first public timetable for the removal of the children, George Brandis, Australia's High Commissioner to Britain, said Canberra will remove the children, though he did specify where they would be moved to.
""There are hardly any children in Nauru and in New Guinea, and we expect that by the end of this year there'll be none,"" Brandis told British radio station LBC on Tuesday.
By resettling the child refugees, Morrison will meet a key demand from several independent lawmakers for supporting for his government.
Morrison's ruling Liberal Party is on course to lose its one-seat parliamentary majority as voters in a Sydney electorate look set to select an independent lawmaker to replace former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Counting in the by-election continues, with independent Kerryn Phelps ahead of the Liberal Party candidate by nearly 1,800 votes, with just 2,000 ballots to be processed, the Australian Electoral Commission said
Turnbull quit politics shortly after he was removed from the office of prime minister in August following a party revolt that installed Morrison as leader.
The loss of Turnbull's affluent Sydney constituency would leave Morrison's government dependent on the support of five independent lawmakers to pass legislation in the lower house of parliament.

The three-stage rocket, Zhuque-1, was developed by Beijing-based Landspace. The company said in a microblog post after nominal first and second stages that the spacecraft failed to reach orbit as a result of an issue with the third stage.
""Before Zhuque carrier rocket was launched, its mission was already completed,"" the company said in the post on Saturday, without giving further details. 
Landspace was founded in 2015 and soon aimed to be the first Chinese private company to deliver a satellite into orbit. The company said it was the first private licensed company in China to launch carrier rockets.
Zhuque-1 was carrying a satellite named ""Future"" built for state media China Central Television.
In May, China launched ""Chongqing Liangjiang Star"" into space, the first rocket developed by Beijing-based private firm OneSpace Technology.

Since coming to office in 2012, President Xi Jinping has made becoming a ""space flight superpower"" a priority for the government, which has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Aoun says Lebanon government row 'not easy', signals differences with Hezbollah","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Wednesday the differences blocking a deal over a new national unity government were ""not easy"" and signaled he was at odds with his ally Hezbollah over the last outstanding issue.
Five months since an election, prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has been unable to clinch a deal on the new government because of the competing demands of rival parties for cabinet seats that are parceled out along sectarian lines.
A deal seemed close on Monday when a row over Christian representation was settled with the anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces ceding ground to Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, which is allied to Shi'ite Hezbollah.
But Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, is pressing its demand for one of its Sunni allies to be given a portfolio in the 30-seat cabinet to reflect gains they made in the May 6 parliamentary election.
Aoun, in a televised interview, said obstacles ""are being created that are not proper and not justified"".
Addressing the demand of the Hezbollah-backed Sunnis, he said: ""This matter caused the delay, and this delay is a type of political tactic that is hurting our big strategy.""
Aoun said the Hezbollah-backed Sunnis amounted to ""individuals, not a bloc"" and had gathered together ""recently"" to make their demand for a cabinet post. 
Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni leader, has ruled out ceding one of his cabinet seats to the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis. 
Another possible way out of the problem would be for Aoun to name one of the Hezbollah allies among a group of ministers allocated to him. But Aoun gave no indication he was willing to do so in the interview marking the second anniversary of his becoming president - a post reserved for a Maronite Christian.
Aoun said he wanted a strong prime minister, and not to weaken Hariri.
Western-backed Hariri lost more than a third of his seats in the parliamentary election, many of them to the Hezbollah allies.

Lebanon is dire need of a government able to make economic reforms that are seen as more pressing than ever. The country is wrestling with the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy and stagnant growth.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>",Britain says no date set for end of Brexit talks after Raab hints at November deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday said there was no set date for Brexit talks to finish, backtracking from a letter by Brexit minister Dominic Raab that suggested a deal on the terms of its departure from the European Union could be finalised by Nov. 21.
Raab had said that a Brexit deal was firmly in sight and should be agreed by that date in a week-old letter to a lawmaker that was published on Wednesday, briefly sending sterling sharply higher.
But his department later said that while Nov. 21 was the date suggested by the chair of parliament's Brexit committee, that did not mean a firm date had been set for a deal to be done.
""There is no set date for the (EU) negotiations to conclude,"" a ministry spokesperson said in a statement after Raab's letter to the Chair of parliament's Committee on Exiting the European Union was published. 
""The 21st November was the date offered by the Chair of the Select Committee for (Raab) to give evidence.”
With just five months until Britain is due to exit the European Union, little is clear: Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a divorce deal and rebels in her Conservative party - both eurosceptic and pro-EU - have threatened to vote down any deal she does make.
Raab, in a letter dated Oct. 24 and sent to Hilary Benn, chairman of parliament's Brexit committee, said the United Kingdom and EU had resolved most differences, though the issue of Northern Ireland remained.
""I would be happy to give evidence to the Committee when a deal is finalised, and currently expect 21 November to be suitable,"" Raab said, in response to a request to appear in front of lawmakers.
""The end is now firmly in sight and, while obstacles remain, it cannot be beyond us to navigate them. We have resolved most of the issues."" 
Asked about Raab's remarks in the letter, a spokesman for May reiterated that Britain wanted to clinch a Brexit deal as soon as possible.
The major obstacle to a deal has been Britain's wish to keep the border of its province of Northern Ireland with EU member state Ireland open - preserving frictionless trade and a 1998 peace deal that ended Irish sectarian violence - while sticking to its goal of leaving the EU's single market and customs union so as to forge its own trade deals around the world.
Sterling  surged as much as one percent versus the dollar to trade at $1.2831, and versus the euro to 88.43 pence (EURGBP=D3) after Raab's comments, before retreating.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a deal on Britain's withdrawal was possible by Nov. 21 but that it would require British negotiators in particular to step up efforts.
""I think it is possible to get a deal in November,"" Coveney told a joint press conference with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris. 
But Coveney said Britain must make good on its past commitments, including on an open Irish border and a ""backstop"" clause to anchor it in law, for negotiators to reach an accord.
""If there is no follow through on those commitments, then it is hard to see how this gets done in November,"" he said.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said that a deal was ""entirely possible"" by Nov 21 and that he was encouraged by progress in Brexit talks. He said the outstanding issues could be resolved ""if we put our minds to it.""
Raab said four important aspects remained to be resolved: a temporary joint UK-EU customs territory; an option to extend a transition period during which Britain's EU membership conditions would remain unchanged; a measure to ensure any extension was not indefinite; and continued untrammeled access for Northern Irish businesses to the rest of the United Kingdom.
EU Brexit negotiators told national envoys in Brussels on Wednesday that technical talks were still focusing on the Irish issue. They will give another update next week and the bloc will also hold seminars from mid-November to prepare for a ""no-deal"" Brexit, a disruptive outcome that both sides say is undesirable.

Sources in Brussels were still hopeful a deal could be sealed in November once Britain has passed its budget.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:08PM ET</span>","Rare NATO-Russia talks address military drills, 1987 missile treaty","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO and Russia envoys on Wednesday discussed their respective large-scale military exercises and a Cold War-era missile treaty that Washington vows to quit over accusations of Russian non-compliance, the Western alliance said.
The talks, the first between the former Cold War foes since May, came against a backdrop of renewed tensions between the West and Russia, most notably over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine.
A NATO statement said the sides had an ""open exchange"" of views on Ukraine, Russia's Vostok military exercises and NATO's ongoing Trident Juncture drills, as well as on Afghanistan and hybrid security threats. 
NATO this month launched its largest exercises since the Cold War in Norway, whose non-NATO Nordic neighbors Sweden and Finland have drawn closer to the alliance since being spooked by Russia's role in the turmoil in Ukraine. 
NATO troops are maneuvering close to the borders of Russia, which held its huge annual Vostok military drill in September. The two are regularly irked by each other's exercises, where a show of force and deterrence play a major role. 
The drills have steadily grown in size in recent years as an atmosphere of stand-off between Russia and the West has grown. Russia's 2018 edition of Vostok mobilized 300,000 troops and included joint exercises with the Chinese army - the biggest such drills since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. 
NATO head Jens Stoltenberg also called on Russia to make quick changes to comply in full with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. Russia denies violating it.
""We all agree that the INF Treaty has been crucial to Euro-Atlantic security...Allies have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the new Russian missile system, known as the 9M729 or SSC-8,"" Stoltenberg said in the statement.
He said development of the SSC-8 land-based, intermediate-range Cruise missile posed ""a serious risk to strategic stability"".
""NATO has urged Russia repeatedly to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and to actively engage in a constructive dialogue with the United States...We regret that Russia has not heeded our calls,"" Stoltenberg added.
At the same time, NATO hopes Washington - whose other rivals China or Iran are not constrained by the treaty that rid Europe of land-based nuclear missiles - will not pull out in the end.
European leaders worry any collapse of the INF treaty could lead to a new, destabilizing arms race.

""The United States Attorney's Office and the FBI are investigating the death of James Bulger as a homicide,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia said in a statement. The office declined to provide further details.
Bulger, 89, had lived a double life as one of Boston's most notorious mobsters and as a secret Federal Bureau of Investigation informant before going on the run for 16 years. He was convicted in August 2013 of 11 murders, among other charges, and sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years.
A U.S. Bureau of Prisons statement said on Tuesday the FBI was looking into the death.
Bulger, whose life was depicted in the 2015 film ""Black Mass"" starring Johnny Depp, had been transferred a day earlier in a wheelchair to the high-security Hazelton penitentiary in West Virginia, a prison employee briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
Two men were seen on surveillance footage entering Bulger's cell, the prison employee said. Bulger's body was later discovered wrapped in a sheet, the employee said, and had been beaten so badly that blood had come out of his ears.
He had been captured in June 2011, after a former Icelandic beauty queen tipped off authorities that he was living in Santa Monica, California.
The U.S. Justice Department paid more than $20 million in damages to families of people killed by Bulger on the grounds that he was operating under government supervision while killing.

ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition has massed thousands of troops near Yemen's main port city of Hodeidah, local military sources said on Wednesday, in a move to pressure Iranian-aligned Houthi insurgents to return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
The United States and Britain have called for an end to the 3-1/2-year war that has driven impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, raising pressure on Saudi Arabia as it faces a global outcry over the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The military alliance of Sunni Muslim states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has deployed forces around 30,000-strong south of Houthi-held Hodeidah and near its eastern entrance, pro-coalition Yemeni military sources told Reuters.
""Thousands of Yemeni soldiers trained by the coalition have been sent to the outskirts of Hodeidah in addition to modern weaponry including armored vehicles and tanks... in preparation for a big operation in coming days,"" said one source.
Residents told Reuters the Houthis had also deployed forces in the center of Hodeidah city, at the port and in southern neighborhoods in anticipation of an onslaught.
The coalition and the Houthis have not commented on the military movements.
The U.N. special envoy to Yemen is trying to salvage peace talks that collapsed in September, raising the risk of a renewed assault on the Red Sea city, the country's main port and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis reliant on humanitarian aid.
Envoy Martin Griffiths welcomed a call by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday for a cessation of hostilities ahead of U.N.-led negotiations scheduled to begin next month.
Britain also backed an end to the fighting, which has killed more than 10,000 people, according to available U.N. figures. Half the population of Yemen - some 14 million people - could soon be on the brink of famine, the U.N. says.
""We remain committed to bring the Yemeni parties to the negotiations table within a month,"" Griffiths said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
He urged the warring parties to resume consultations on a framework for political talks and confidence-building measures such as supporting the central bank and a prisoner swap.
Griffiths is hoping to announce a round of talks ""as soon as he can but we're not at that stage just yet,"" U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York on Wednesday.
DIRE SITUATION
The Houthi official responsible for foreign affairs, Hisham Sharaf, welcomed Griffiths' continued efforts but urged Western governments to take concrete steps to enforce a ceasefire to create ""conditions conducive to peace far away from any pressure or dictates"", the Houthi-run Saba news agency said.
The Western-backed Arab alliance intervened in Yemen's war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government.
But after seizing the southern city of Aden, the alliance has made no major gains in its war to unseat the Houthis, who hold the most populous parts of Yemen including the capital Sanaa.
Aid groups warned of deteriorating conditions.
""The recent increase in military activity in... Hodeidah threatens the security of our life-saving operations,"" World Food Programme (WFP) spokesman Herve Verhoosel said.
The WFP has enough cereals to assist 6.4 million of the neediest Yemenis for 2-1/2 months, with the aim to reach 8 million, he added.
Red Cross spokeswoman Sara Alzawqari said an estimated 3,200 families – some 22,000-28,000 people - were in need of basic necessities including food, water and shelter in Hodeidah, many having fled fighting in rural areas.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have said that taking control of Hodeidah would force the Houthi movement to the negotiating table by cutting off its main supply line.
But a previous offensive on the city in June failed to accomplish any gains and the coalition halted the fighting to give U.N. peace talks in Geneva a chance.

The talks were abandoned when the Houthis failed to show up, accusing the coalition of blocking their team from traveling. The Yemeni government accused the group of trying to sabotage the negotiations.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 02:41PM ET</span>",Nigerian Shi'ite group says 42 killed when security forces fired upon protests,"By Garba Muhammad and Abraham Achirga
KADUNA/MARARABA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The movement of a jailed Nigerian Shi'ite cleric whose followers have repeatedly been targeted by the authorities said on Wednesday security forces had killed 42 of its members during two days of violent crackdowns on protests in the capital Abuja.
Security forces opened fire with live ammunition on members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) who had marched in their hundreds to demand the release of their leader Ibrahim Zakzaky, jailed since 2015 when the army killed hundreds of his followers at his compound and a nearby mosque and burial ground.
The IMN raised its death toll on Wednesday from the two previous days' violence to 42 from an earlier figure of 25. The toll included seven people who died of injuries received on Tuesday and 35 killed the previous day, said Ibrahim Musa, an IMN spokesman.
On Wednesday evening, 20 bodies lay shrouded in white, awaiting burial in the town of Mararaba, some five miles (8 km) from Abuja, a Reuters reporter said.
""I, as a Shi'ite today, I'm carrying my death certificate,"" said Muhammed Ibrahim Gamawa, an IMN youth leader, at the burial site.
""Under Buhari's government any Shia in Nigeria is under threat and can be gunned down any day, any time, any minute,"" he said, referring to Nigerian President Mohammadu Buhari.
""We are not safe, we are an endangered species in Nigeria.""
A few hours earlier, in a bustling commercial area of Abuja, dozens of IMN members staged a short march. Security forces were absent.
""We are ready to die for our Zakzaky!"" and ""Free Sheikh Zakzaky!"" the marchers chanted.
""Death to Buhari! Death to America! Death to U.K!"" they also cried. Buhari's administration has overseen the deadly crackdown on IMN over the past three years.
PROTESTERS
On Monday, the army opened fire on the marchers on the outskirts of Abuja. On Tuesday, the police shot at the protesters in the city center, issuing a statement later that day saying 400 IMN members were detained. The statement did not mention any deaths.
Police and army spokesmen did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on the updated death toll. The army has said that three IMN members were killed on Monday.
Zakzaky was charged in April this year with murder over the 2015 violence, after being held for more than two years. Authorities ignored a court ruling during the period before he was charged that he be released, sparking protests from his followers.
IMN protests have frequently been met with force. In April, police fired bullets and tear gas during days of protests by IMN, wounding at least four protesters.
After the December 2015 crackdown, Buhari accused the Shi'ites of creating ""a state within a state"", though he also said civilian deaths could not be justified. Since then, however, the government has remained largely silent on accusations it has used excessive force against the group.
Around half of Nigeria's 190 million people are Muslims. Although virtually all of them are Sunnis, Zakzaky has attracted an estimated 3 million followers as a preacher of Shi'ite Islam since being drawn to that sect by the 1979 revolution in Iran.

The repression of IMN and detention of its leader have drawn criticism from international human rights watchdogs and raised concern that the group could become radicalized, just as the Sunni Muslim militant group Boko Haram turned into a violent insurgency in 2009 after police killed its leader.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 01:59PM ET</span>","Austria to shun global migration pact, fearing creep in human rights","By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria will follow the United States and Hungary in backing out of a United Nations migration pact over concerns it will blur the line between legal and illegal migration, the right-wing government said on Wednesday. 
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was approved in July by all 193 member nations except the United States, which backed out last year.
Hungary's right-wing government has since said it will not sign the final document at a ceremony in Morocco in December. Poland, which has also clashed with Brussels by resisting national quotas for asylum seekers, has said it is considering the same step. 
""Austria will not join the U.N. migration pact,"" said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a conservative and immigration hard-liner who governs in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party.
""We view some points of the migration pact very critically, such as the mixing up of seeking protection with labor migration,"" said Kurz, who argues that migrants rescued in the Mediterranean should not be brought straight to Europe. 
Vienna currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, a role that usually involves playing a mediating role to bridge divisions within the bloc. Instead its move highlighted the disagreements on migration that have blighted relations among the 28 member states for years. 
The Austrian government is concerned that signing up to the pact, even though it is not binding, could eventually help lead to the recognition of a ""human right to migration"". The text of a cabinet decision formally approving its move on Wednesday said it would argue against such a right.
""We reject any movement in that direction,"" Freedom Party leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache told a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting.
Austria took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015 during a migration crisis in which more than a million people traveled to Europe, many of them fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere.
That experience dominated last year's parliamentary election and helped propel Kurz's conservatives to power. He has said he will prevent any repeat of that influx and has implemented policies that include restricting benefits for new immigrants.
The U.N. pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, how to integrate them into new countries and how to return them to their home countries.
The United Nations has hailed it as a historic and comprehensive pact that could serve as a basis for future policies.
Austria will not send an envoy to the signing ceremony in Morocco and will abstain at a U.N. General Assembly vote on the pact next year, Kurz's office said.
In a paper this month, the Brookings Institution, a U.S. think-tank, said the pact ""reflects widespread recognition, among even the most skeptical member states, that managing migration effectively is in the common interest"".
Amnesty International criticized Vienna's stance.

""Instead of facing global challenges on an international level, the government is increasingly isolating Austria. That is irresponsible,"" the rights group said in a statement.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul's chief prosecutor's office said on Wednesday that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was suffocated in a premeditated killing as soon as he entered Saudi Arabia's consulate four weeks ago, and his body was then dismembered and disposed of.
In a statement issued after two days of talks with Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb, it also said no concrete results were reached in those meetings.
Later on Wednesday, the spokesman for Turkey's ruling AK Party, Omer Celik, said Khashoggi's killing could not have been carried out without orders from senior positions, in one of Ankara's strongest accusations directed at Riyadh yet.
Celik also said it was not possible that Saudi officials had still not found the journalist's body after nearly a month of investigations.
Khashoggi's death has escalated into a crisis for Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, which at first denied any knowledge of or role in his disappearance on Oct. 2. 
Mojeb later said Khashoggi's killing was premeditated and Riyadh said 18 suspects had been arrested. But Turkey, which released a stream of evidence undermining Riyadh's early denials, has demanded more details including the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body and who ordered his killing.
""Despite our well-intentioned efforts to reveal the truth, no concrete results have come out of those meetings,"" the Istanbul prosecutor's office said of the talks on Monday and Tuesday between Mojeb and Istanbul chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan.
The killing of Khashoggi, a critic of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has put into focus the West's close relationship with Saudi Arabia - a major arms buyer and lynchpin of Washington's regional plans to contain Iran.
Riyadh's European allies have criticized its initial response and U.S. President Donald Trump said Saudi authorities had staged the ""worst cover-up ever"", although he has repeatedly said he would not jeopardize U.S. business with the kingdom. 
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, who has demanded more information from Saudi Arabia, said on Tuesday Fidan had asked Mojeb to disclose who sent a 15-strong team from Riyadh which is suspected of involvement in the killing.
The prosecutor's statement said Fidan also repeated Ankara's request for the 18 suspects to be extradited to face trial in Turkey, and asked Mojeb to disclose the identity of a ""local cooperator"" who, according to a Saudi official, disposed of Khashoggi's body.
In a written response, Mojeb invited Fidan to Saudi Arabia to question the suspects and determine ""the fate of the body"" and establish whether the killing was premeditated, the Turkish prosecutor's statement said. 
It said Mojeb's response also distanced Riyadh from the idea that a ""local cooperator"" had been involved, saying that Saudi authorities had not made an official statement to that effect.
Mojeb left Turkey on Wednesday evening after a three-day visit during which he also held talks at the offices of Turkey's National Intelligence Agency (MIT).
Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia were strained last year when Ankara sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
Erdogan's government has pressed Riyadh to conclude its investigation as soon as possible. ""The whole truth must be revealed,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said this week.

Erdogan has also called on Saudi Arabia to disclose who ordered Khashoggi's killing. ""There is no point in procrastinating or trying to save some people from under this,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Former Italian soccer star sentenced in mafia trial,"ROME (Reuters) - An Italian court on Wednesday sentenced former national soccer star Vincenzo Iaquinta to two years in jail and his father, Giuseppe, to 19 years at the end of a trial of almost 150 people for alleged mafia links.
Iaquinta was found guilty of a firearms' offense but the judge dismissed accusations that he was involved with the 'Ndrangheta, Italy's most powerful organized crime network which is based in the southern region of Calabria.
However, the court in the northern city of Reggio Emilia ruled that his father did have mafia ties. More than 120 other defendants were also found guilty in the case, which was the biggest ever such trial targeting the 'Ndrangheta.
Lawyers for the pair, who are Calabrian, said they would appeal against the ruling while Iaquinta furiously denied any wrongdoing after the sentence was read out.
""They have ruined my life over nothing just because I come from Calabria,"" Iaquinta yelled as he left the court building. ""We have done nothing and we have nothing to do with the 'Ndrangheta. I am suffering like a dog ... for nothing.""
Defendants are allowed two appeals before any verdict becomes definitive and even if the sentence were eventually confirmed, it is highly unlikely that Iaquinta would ever have to serve time in prison time for such an offense.
Iaquinta used to play for Juventus and was part of Italy's victorious team in the 2006 soccer World Cup.
The court ruled that he had illegally handed over two revolvers to his father, who at the time was under court restrictions and not allowed to have access to firearms.
Iaquinta said he had given the guns to his father for safekeeping as he was about to move house.
The 'Ndrangheta has grown steadily in the last 10 years due to its role in smuggling cocaine and other drugs into Europe from South America.
Most of the defendants in the Reggio Emilio trial were accused of involvement in the 'Ndrangheta's activities in the Emilia-Romagna region around Bologna. The case has taken more than two years to conclude.

""So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' Many legal scholars agree....."" Trump wrote in a Twitter post six days before U.S. congressional elections.
The Constitution's 14th Amendment, added after the Civil War, grants citizenship to anyone born on American soil and was intended to give constitutional protections to former slaves. But some Republicans, including Trump, say it creates an incentive for people to enter the country illegally to have children. 
George Conway, the lawyer husband of one of Trump's top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Wednesday that such a move to end birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional. 
""Sometimes the Constitution’s text is plain as day and bars what politicians seek to do. That’s the case with President Trump’s proposal to end 'birthright citizenship' through an executive order,"" the attorney wrote. 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday there was ""more than just one piece of the puzzle"" on immigration.
""The president wants to see a total reform take place. We have massive loopholes in our immigration system that we have to close or we're just going to continue kicking the can down the road,"" she added.
Trump first raised the issue of scrapping birthright citizenship on Tuesday. The proposal gained support from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally. But other party members were critical, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who said the president could not end the right with the stroke of a pen.

Trump - who has made rhetoric against illegal immigrants and policies to curb both illegal and legal immigration key themes of his presidency - has raised it in rallies ahead of the Nov. 6 election, in which Republicans are trying to maintain control of Congress in the face of challenges by Democrats.

President Donald Trump's administration has been quietly pushing for Gulf Arab countries, together with Egypt and Jordan, to start putting together what some White House officials have called an ""Arab NATO"" of Sunni Muslim allies to stand against Shi'ite power Iran. 
A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states is already intervening in Yemen's war, staging air strikes against Iran-aligned Houthi forces which control much of the country's north, including the capital Sanaa.
In a statement on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, the Egyptian military spokesman said that air, ground, naval and special forces from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan have begun arriving in Egypt for the exercises called ""The Shield of the Arabs 1"", due to be held from Nov. 3-16.
Observers from Lebanon and Morocco will also attend the maneuvers, the spokesman, Colonel Tamer al-Refai said.
Refai said the exercises were part of Egypt's efforts to enhance military cooperation with other Arab countries but declined to speculate on whether they could evolve into some sort of a military alliance. 
Qatar, which is involved in a row with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, and Oman are not participating in the exercises.
The White House confirmed in July it had been working on the concept of an alliance with its regional partners for several months.
A U.S. source said that Saudi officials had raised the idea of a security pact before Trump visited the kingdom last year when he announced a massive arms deal, but the alliance proposal did not get off the ground. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Tuesday for a cessation of hostilities in Yemen and said U.N.-led negotiations to end the civil war should begin next month.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - About 2,000 migrants began walking north from El Salvador's capital on Wednesday, the latest of several groups trying to reach the United States, even as President Donald Trump increases pressure to halt the flow of people.
The migrants departed in two groups, including men and women pushing strollers and others with children on their shoulders. On Sunday, a separate group comprising about 300 people set off for the U.S. border from the Salvadoran capital.
A caravan estimated to number at least 3,500 people, which left Honduras in mid-October and is now in southern Mexico, has become a major issue in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
The bulk of migrants caught trying to enter the United States illegally via Mexico come from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Many make the dangerous journey north to escape high levels of poverty and violence in their homelands.
The United States is in the process of sending 5,200 troops to its southern border as part of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. The prospect has so far not discouraged people from leaving El Salvador.
""It scares us a little. But since we're seeing a ton of people going together, we can help one another to cross,"" said Jose Machado, one of the migrants departing San Salvador, carrying a backpack stuffed with clothing and toiletries.
Trump, who has threatened to slash U.S. aid to Central America and close the U.S. border with Mexico, said in a tweet on Wednesday that Mexico needs to keep up efforts to discourage the migrants, who he described as ""tough fighters.""
A clash at the Mexico-Guatemala border on Sunday left one migrant dead and several law enforcement officers injured.
""Mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop Caravan. Should stop them before they reach our Border, but won't!"" Trump said in a Tweet. 
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday praised Mexico's actions to slow the movement of people, but told Fox News: ""They can do more.""
Police estimated the two groups leaving San Salvador numbered around 1,000 each. One cohort left around dawn, followed by a second later in the morning. 

Some waved Salvadoran flags as motorists honked in support and shouted, ""God bless you.""

The air strikes targeted several regions in the neighboring northern Iraq, including the Qandil mountains, a PKK stronghold, the military said.
Turkey has in recent months carried out regular strikes on PKK bases in northern Iraq. PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched its insurgency in Turkey in 1984.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is expected to give details about U.S. President Donald Trump's Venezuela and Cuba policy on Thursday when national security adviser John Bolton travels to Miami to give an address on Latin America.
Days ahead of high-stakes elections in Florida, home to many migrants from the region, Bolton will deliver his remarks at Freedom Tower, a building where Cuban refugees were welcomed in the 1960s after leaving the Communist-controlled island.
Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015, driven out by food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. Thousands have made their way to south Florida.
Bolton's speech will come a day after Trump was due to campaign in Florida for Republican candidates in tight Senate and gubernatorial races in the Nov. 6 elections, and a day before former President Barack Obama was scheduled to rally Democrats in Miami.
He is expected to be introduced by longtime Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring from Congress. Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, has been critical of Trump, but supported the hard line he has taken on Cuba.
Trump has rolled back parts of Obama's 2014 detente with Cuba, tightening rules on Americans traveling to the island and restricting U.S. companies from doing business there. But Trump has maintained diplomatic relations re-established under Obama with the former Cold War foe.
Trump last month linked Venezuela's economic collapse to ""its Cuban sponsors"" in a speech to the United Nations, and Bolton is expected to elaborate on that theme, a senior administration official told reporters earlier this month. 
The Trump administration plans to ramp up economic pressure on Cuba's military and intelligence services, the official said.
The White House also wants to increase pressure on Venezuela. On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed working on the issue with Brazil's new President-elect Jair Bolsonaro.
The U.S. government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country's economic implosion.
Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by U.S.-backed adversaries.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting Venezuela's oil sector, but now sees less immediate need to do so given sagging production by the OPEC member.

The duchess's great-great-grandfather, Francis Martineau Lupton had five children, three of whom - Francis, Maurice and Lionel - were killed in the war.
Ahead of the centenary of the end of the conflict, Kate, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince William, was shown documents in the Imperial War Museum's archive including letters they sent home and a letter of condolence sent on behalf of King George V from Buckingham Palace's Keeper of the Privy Purse.
""The King realizes that this is the third beloved son you have given in your country's cause and His Majesty trusts you may be granted strength and comfort in the further sorrow which you have been called upon to bear,"" the letter said. 
Captain Maurice Lupton was the first of Kate's family to die, killed by a sniper in 1915 aged 28. His 24-year-old brother, Lieutenant Lionel Lupton, who served with 28th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and spent a significant time in trenches on the front line, was killed in action the following year.
In February 1917, Major Francis Lupton, who served with the 8th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, was killed by a bomb aged 31.

Kate was also shown the registration card of her great-grandmother Olive, sister of the three brothers who were killed, who worked as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid detachment.

This is the latest setback for Gigaba, who said on Sunday that he had faced blackmail threats over a private sex video that was leaked after he said his phone was hacked.
Gigaba was finance minister between March 2017 and February 2018 under scandal-plagued former president Jacob Zuma. He was moved back to the home affairs ministry by President Cyril Ramaphosa in a cabinet reshuffle in February.
A South African court ruled last December that Gigaba had violated the constitution when he denied having ever approved an application by the Oppenheimers to operate an immigration service for wealthy VIPs at Johannesburg's main airport.
Nicky Oppenheimer, former chairman of diamond miner De Beers and one of South Africa's wealthiest people, told a parliamentary committee this week that Gigaba had initially approved his family's plan to open a private terminal at OR Tambo airport in 2016.
On Wednesday Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane directed Ramaphosa to discipline Gigaba and to inform her of the action he had taken within 20 days. ""The minister has committed a breach of the constitution,"" Mkhwebane told a news conference.
Gigaba's spokesman did not answer his phone when called by Reuters on Wednesday.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",Senior Saudi prince returns home amid Khashoggi murder crisis,"By Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - A senior Saudi Arabian prince who recently appeared to criticize the king and crown prince has returned to Riyadh, in what some sources close to the royal family say is a sign it wants to form a united front amid its worst political crisis in a generation.
Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, a younger brother of King Salman and uncle of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, arrived on Tuesday after 2-1/2 months abroad, three sources said, as the kingdom deals with the fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
A senior Arab diplomat said Prince Ahmed had sought reassurances for safe passage from the king before traveling, and a Saudi with royal ties said it appears they had been given.
""I think there must have been some pre-understanding. There have been messages going back and forth, and when things were sorted out he decided to come back,"" said the Saudi source.
Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Prince Ahmed's return and the reasons behind it.
Since September, Saudi watchers have wondered when or whether Prince Ahmed would return home, after online footage surfaced in which he appeared to deflect criticism of the royal family by singling out the king and crown prince.
He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, comprising the ruling family's senior members, who opposed the ousting of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince in favor of Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017, two Saudi sources told Reuters at the time.
The king's apparent approval of Prince Ahmed's return is a further sign that the 82-year-old monarch is taking a more hands-on role in Saudi policy since Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at the beginning of October.
The king has delegated vast powers to his son Prince Mohammed, known in the West as MbS. The crown prince has embarked on sweeping social and economic reforms but has marginalized some senior royals and overseen a crackdown on dissent.
The sources said it was unfathomable that Prince Ahmed, a son of the kingdom's founder, could be arrested or mistreated.
""They are mending their differences in the eye of the storm,"" said a Saudi businessman who is close to royal circles.
INTENSE PRESSURE
Saudi Arabia faces intense pressure to clarify how Khashoggi was killed, with some Western allies including U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting ultimate responsibility lies with MbS as the kingdom's de facto ruler.
Riyadh at first denied any knowledge of, or role in, Khashoggi's disappearance, but later contradicted those statements, saying his killing was premeditated.
Prince Ahmed was greeted by MbS on his arrival in Riyadh, one of the sources said, but none of the customary photographs or statements were published.
""MbS being at the airport to greet him upon his return is perhaps, Ahmed will hope, a sign that the young crown prince wants to signal that the traditional deference to senior family elders is being resumed,"" said independent analyst Neil Partrick.
Since his father acceded to the throne in 2015, 33-year-old Prince Mohammed sent shockwaves through a dynasty that prizes seniority and balance, by concentrating power in one branch to an extent unprecedented since the days of his grandfather.
He had senior royals arrested last year as part of an anti-corruption campaign that overturned unspoken rules about royal privilege. Critics said the purge was a power play.
MENDING FENCES
So grave is the fallout over the killing of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and MbS critic, that King Salman has felt compelled to intervene, five sources with links to the royal family told Reuters this month.
But analysts say it is unlikely that Prince Ahmed, 76, would replace MbS.
""It is very difficult to imagine Prince Ahmed providing an alternative to the current succession strategy,"" said Neil Quilliam, senior research fellow at Chatham House.
""It is much more likely that the family is closing ranks and offering senior princes such as Ahmed a pathway back and, at the same time, a means to inform policy.""
Prince Ahmed's return could play well in Western capitals that want to see accountability for Khashoggi's murder but also stability for continued investments worth billions of dollars.
""Ahmed's return looks like a potentially useful message to be sending the U.S. and other Saudi allies at what is still a fraught and sensitive time,"" said Partrick, lead contributor to Saudi Arabian Foreign Policy.
Prince Ahmed was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, but served as minister for less than five months before being replaced in 2012. He has not held an official post since then and is not thought to command much loyalty among internal security services.
Recent attention on his relationship with the king and crown prince stems from a video that appeared on social media showing Prince Ahmed responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty.
The crowd condemned Riyadh's war in Yemen and its support for Bahrain's crackdown on Shi'ite opposition.
""Why all Al Saud? There are specific individuals who could be responsible,"" he can be heard saying, in comments interpreted by detractors of MbS as criticism of the king and crown prince.
State news agency SPA then issued a statement quoting Prince Ahmed saying: ""I made it clear that the king and the crown prince are responsible for the state and its decisions, and this is true for the security and stability of the country and its people. What was mentioned cannot be read in any other way.""
Another Saudi source at the time downplayed the video's importance, saying Prince Ahmed posed no real threat to MbS.
""It was a moment of unguarded honesty, but the family will not have a fight in public, it's just not their way.""

233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Bulgaria charges senior state official in passport scam,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged a senior state official as part of an investigation into a document scam they said had enabled foreigners to obtain Bulgarian passports and travel freely in the European Union.
Bulgaria has made little progress in stamping out graft since joining the EU in 2007 and is under pressure from the European Commission to strengthen its law enforcement and to prosecute and sentence corrupt officials.
Authorities detained Petar Haralampiev, head of the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad, on Monday on suspicion of taking bribes and leading an organized criminal group. Haralampiev's lawyer said he denied the accusations. 
Some 20 others were also detained in the investigation, including the chief secretary of the agency who faces charges of bribe taking and trade in influence. 
""This is the most serious case of high-level corruption and there is no analogy in our modern history because we have collected concrete evidence of specific crimes,"" deputy chief prosecutor Ivan Geshev told reporters.
Prosecutors said applicants, mainly from the Western Balkans, Moldova and Ukraine, had been paying up to 8,000 euros ($9,000) to fraudulently secure certificates that established their Bulgarian origin. 
Bribes were also paid to speed up the process, they said, adding that more than 20,000 applications had been delayed. 
Armed with the certificate, the applicants could apply for Bulgarian passports, and with them the right to travel and work freely across the 28-nation European Union. 
There are significant Bulgarian minorities in Macedonia, Serbia, Moldova and Ukraine.
Prosecutors said there were no indications that documents had been issued to other foreigners from Africa, the Middle East or Asia.
Prosecutors said the evidence suggested that the corrupt practices dated back to June 2017, a month after Haralampiev took over the agency.

Army General Manuel Cristopher takes over the agency, known as Sebin, just weeks after the government announced that municipal legislator Fernando Alban had committed suicide by jumping from the 10th floor of the agency's headquarters in Caracas.
Opposition leaders said the government provided inconsistent accounts of the incident, and say Alban had been tortured and later killed by security forces. 
The incident drew global condemnation, and the White House accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of involvement in Alban's death.
Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab described opposition critics as ""sorcerers of necrophilia"" who were taking advantage of Alban's death to criticize Maduro.
Alban was jailed on Oct. 5 for alleged involvement in the explosion of two drones in August during a military parade that the government later described as an attempt to assassinate Maduro.
Cristopher replaces outgoing Sebin chief Gustavo Gonzalez. It was not immediately evident whether Gonzalez resigned or whether he would be given a new post.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Macron's strategist says goal is to reshape fracturing EU politics,"By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's fragmenting political landscape is an opportunity for Emmanuel Macron to blow apart Brussels' traditional left-right duopoly in next year's European election, the newly appointed head of the French president's EU campaign said.
In his first interview since his appointment this week as top strategist in Macron's En Marche party, Stéphane Séjourné says the campaign will ""shake up the system"", tapping into growing disaffection among the mainstream left and right.
""We see political instability more like an opportunity than a constraint,"" Séjourné told Reuters in a cafe a block away from the Elysee Palace, where he has spent the past 18 months as Macron's behind-the-scenes political adviser.
National and regional elections across Europe, most recently in Germany, have seen a surge in support for far-right and pro-environment parties, at the expense of the traditional center-right conservative and center-left social democrat parties.
That is creating messier, harder-to-govern coalitions. For Macron, it is an opportunity to draw lawmakers from across the spectrum and build a new political group in the European Parliament, as he did in France. 
""I want to speak with Spanish Socialists, Ciudadanos, with the German Greens but also with parts of the CDU while at the same time exchanging with the SPD,"" said Séjourné, 33, referring to parties in the ruling German coalition.
Macron has framed the European election as a battle between anti-immigrant nationalists and pro-EU 'progressives' and sent emissaries to make contacts with like-minded parties.
While the European Parliament election, held every five years since 1979, has not always made waves, next May's polls promise to have more impact as the fractures in national politics reach the European level.
SPECULATION
However, a repeat of what Macron achieved with his surprise win in France's 2017 election - where he built a new party from scratch and poached lawmakers from both left and right - is seen by analysts as unlikely.
Speculation is rife in Brussels over who Macron will ally himself with. EU figures including Belgian liberal Guy Verhofstadt and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte have made bids to force Macron to form alliances, only to be politely rebuffed.
Created after the last EU elections in 2014, En Marche has no lawmakers in the European chamber but polls show it could garner about a fifth of France's 79 seats in the parliament, which from next year will have 705 members.
By pulling together forces currently sitting with the traditional blocs - the conservative EPP, the Social Democrats (S&D) and the liberals of ALDE - Séjourné believes Macron's grouping could dislodge the EPP as the dominant group.
That could be made easier by the waning influence of Germany's Angela Merkel, who held sway over the EPP for years, as she gradually leaves the stage.
""I think it's possible to gain a majority under various configurations: will it be the progressives? The democrats? There can be a sort of an alliance,"" he said.
Macron's strategy is not to seal any deal until after the election, when the pecking order in the 27 EU member states will become clear.
""All those who said we should have struck alliances eight months ago were wrong,"" said Séjourné. ""We would have ended up with our hands tied to possibly irrelevant forces. We need to take the time to gauge emerging forces in Europe.""
Macron's team sees the surge in Green parties in elections in Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg as a particular opportunity, especially as the French president has made combating climate change one of his main issues. 
""The worst thing would be to pick one partner per country and stick to them,"" Séjourné said.
""VERY CLEVER""
Séjourné is one of the so-called ""Macron Boys"", a close-knit group of thirtysomethings who helped propel the former investment banker to the French presidency before he had turned 40, after a stunningly fast rise.
A former Socialist Youth militant, Séjourné distributed his first leaflets during the 2005 referendum in France that ultimately killed Europe's proposed constitution.
Described by allies as cool-headed, discreet and loyal, he impressed Macron in 2014 with a note he sent to the then-economy minister about how to improve his image on the French left.
""Very clever,"" Macron told him. ""You're hired.""
The son of a France Telecom employee, he grew up in Spain and Latin America. He decided to pursue politics after seeing the fall of Argentina's middle class during its 2001 currency crisis, when he was at the French high school in Buenos Aires.
""The rich Argentine kids ended up being kicked out because their families could no longer pay the fees,"" he said. ""It really made a mark on me. People don't realize bad political choices can create catastrophic situations.""

Now more than 80 of those artworks have gone on display at an exhibition at the Auschwitz Memorial in Oswiecim, Poland.
""David Olere: The One Who Survived Crematorium III,"" shows the extermination process which took place at Auschwitz during the Holocaust through the late painter's own eyes. 
A French Jew of Polish descent, Olere was part of a special unit of male Jewish prisoners, dubbed the Sonderkommando, chosen by the Nazis to discard the bodies of those killed in gas chambers.
""He is the only witness who documented this unimaginable cruelty in the form of paintings and drawings,"" Agnieszka Sieradzka, an art historian at the Museum Collections and one of the curators of the exhibition, said in a press release.
Born in Warsaw in 1902, Olere studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in the Polish capital before eventually settling in Paris. He was arrested in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz, one of several concentration camps operated by the Nazis on Polish soil during the Holocaust in which some six million Jews were killed.
His grandson Marc Oler described the artist, who died in 1985, as ""very, very tough, very, very talented, very, very traumatized"". 
""David Olere wanted the next generation to be aware so they could be ... (spared) the horrors that he had been through and know peace,"" Oler, who attended the exhibition's opening on Tuesday, said. 

The exhibition, which runs until March, displays its own collection of Olere's artwork as well as many others on loan from Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and France's Memorial de la Shoah.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 08:24AM ET</span>",Shopping at well-stocked Venezuelan stores? Better take dollars,"By Corina Pons and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - At a luxury hotel in Venezuela's capital, a small store with amply-stocked shelves offers an array of goods ranging from fine wines to imported baby formula, in stark contrast to the crisis-stricken nation's barren supermarkets.
Another store, on the other side of the country in the sweltering western city of Maracaibo, sells American-branded breakfast cereals, soap and truffle salt. 
In a country with annual inflation topping 400,000 percent, the stores' prices are the only ones that will remain steady.
""Here we sell in dollars,"" said Lourdes Torres, manager of the Maracaibo store, as she attended customers waiting to pay with U.S. legal tender. 
""We accept cash as well as transfers from American banks,"" she said, adding that she also accepts payment in local bolivar currency with prices converted at the black market exchange rate that is nearly four times the official rate.
The privately run ""bodegones,"" reminiscent of the ""dollar stores"" Cuba's government ran in the 1990s, have steadily expanded in recent months as conducting business in the beleaguered bolivar currency becomes increasingly difficult. 
Their rise follows a decision by the government of President Nicolas Maduro to loosen a 15-year-old currency control system that made dollar-based commerce explicitly illegal. 
It also coincides with the growing dollarization of a collapsing economy in which many professionals - from doctors and dentists to personal trainers - are now charging in hard currency to avoid having their earnings swallowed by hyperinflation.
The clientele of the ""bodegones"" are primarily well-heeled Venezuelans with earnings in hard currency. But shoppers also include a growing number of residents who receive remittances from some two million Venezuelans who have emigrated to escape hunger and disease. 
Reuters visited six newly established stores selling in dollars in Caracas and five other major cities, including the border city of San Cristobal and the once-bustling industrial hub of Valencia, now filled with empty factories.
It was not immediately evident how many such stores have opened nor why the government was not requiring the stores to meet state price controls that are enforced at major supermarket chains.
The Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
WE HAVE DIAPERS
The ""bodegones"" often grab customers' attention with luxury products such as high-end chocolates or high-tech gadgets. 
But the most popular items are personal hygiene products like deodorant and toothpaste that are consistently available in greater variety than in supermarkets, according to store managers. 
""People are always asking if we have diapers,"" said the manager of a weeks-old shop in eastern Caracas who, like most shop owners who spoke to Reuters, asked not to be identified. They worry that their operations fall within a legal gray area and could be targeted by authorities.
She said her supply of diapers, displayed next to bottles of champagne, always runs out within a week.
Dollarized prices were unthinkable under regulations created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. They put the government in charge of carrying out nearly all foreign currency transactions and setting prices for consumer goods. 
Maduro's government, which often blames shortages and inflation on unscrupulous businesses overcharging or hoarding products, in August lifted a prohibition on the free exchange of hard currency. But the government did not create a law saying such operations are allowed, which has left many shop owners trepidatious about speaking to the media. 
In September, as the new bodegones were starting to emerge, the government jailed 34 managers of well-known supermarkets on accusations of price-gouging. They were later released and immediately resigned, according to industry sources. 
Maria Uzcategui of commerce association Consecomercio said stores pricing goods in dollars do so ""at their own risk,"" while the government has turned a blind eye and gone after big-name grocery chains for political effect. 
""The arrests are a show to blame retailers for the country's economic situation,"" Uzcategui said. ""That is why they single out the large chains, and not small businesses or these new 'bodegones.'"" 
Prices at the dollar stores are exorbitant for those living on a bolivar-based salaries. The minimum wage is around $10 per month, and at least 80 percent of the population skips at least one meal per day, according to a quality of life study known as Encovi carried out by private universities.
Meanwhile, some $1.1 billion in annual remittances have turned into a lifeline for civil servants, retirees and salaried professionals who want to avoid waiting in long lines or scouring supermarkets in search of what they need.
Sonia Ramirez, a 52-year-old retired judge in San Cristobal, shops at the 'bodegones' with the $120 she gets from her two sons who live in the Dominican Republic and Spain. 

""They are always well-supplied, but at much higher prices than what the government requires,"" she said.

DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar officials visited camps for Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh on Wednesday in an effort to kickstart a process to repatriate hundreds of thousands who fled an army crackdown last year.
More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed into Bangladesh from western Myanmar, U.N. agencies say, after Rohingya insurgent attacks on Myanmar security forces in August 2017 triggered a sweeping military response.
Officials said after meetings in Dhaka on Tuesday returns would begin next month, but the U.N. refugee agency said conditions in Rakhine state were “not yet conducive for returns"".
The agency had completed the second phase of assessment in Rakhine, but its access remained ""limited"", UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said in Geneva on Wednesday.
Rohingya and other Muslims in three townships suffer hardship and economic vulnerability due to restrictions on their movement and the prevailing sentiment is ""fear and mistrust"", he said.
A group of about 60 Rohingya community leaders met a delegation of about a dozen Myanmar officials in the Kutupalong camp, the largest refugee settlement in the world in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazaar district, said two Rohingya men who were present.
Myanmar says it has been ready to accept back the refugees since January, and has built camps near the border to receive them.
Myint Thu, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and leader of the Myanmar delegation, said Myanmar had verified about 5,000 names of refugees and that repatriation would begin with a first batch of 2,000 returnees in mid-November. 
""We are here to meet with the people from the camps so that I can explain what we have prepared for their return and then I can listen to their voices,"" he told reporters in Cox's Bazaar.
Bangladesh handed over an additional list of more than 22,000 Rohingya refugees to be verified by Myanmar, Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Abul Kalam told Reuters.
FIRST STEP TO CITIZENSHIP?
Rohingya leaders said after Wednesday's meeting that they were unconvinced about the proposed repatriation.
""They told us we don't have to stay (in a camp) for long, but when we asked for how many days they could not say,"" said Mohib Ullah, an influential organizer in the camps, reflecting what the officials said. 
Mohib Ullah said Rohingya leaders wanted Myanmar to recognize them as an ethnic group with the right to Myanmar citizenship before they return. 
Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call the Rohingya ""Bengalis"", suggesting they belong in Bangladesh. 
A pamphlet given to refugees by Myanmar officials on Wednesday, seen by Reuters, encourages them to accept new identity cards as a ""first step"" to citizenship. Many Rohingya reject the cards, which they say treat them as foreigners.
Those with ""national verifications cards"" - known as NVCs - would be guaranteed ""socio-economic development"", but those without will be ""stateless"", the pamphlet says.
""When we asked about our citizenship there was no answer,"" said Abdur Rahim, another Rohingya at the meeting. ""They told us to accept NVCs. We are not accepting NVCs. We are not Bengali.""
The Rohingya leaders handed over a letter to Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi setting out their demands, including ""compensation and reparations"" for violence committed against Rohingya.
U.N. rights investigators said in August that Myanmar’s military acted with “genocidal intent” in the crackdown last year. 
The administration of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has denied most of the allegations, arguing it was a legitimate response to quell ""terrorism"".
China, which has provided diplomatic cover to Myanmar over the exodus, has brokered talks with Bangladesh aimed at speeding up repatriation.
Western countries and the United Nations, while calling for accountability for abuses committed by the military, have stressed that any returns must be voluntary.
The repatriation faces resistance from Rakhine Buddhists who make up the majority in western Myanmar's Rakhine state, which the Rohingya also consider their homeland.
Than Tun, a Rakhine community leader, said those who return should be confined to a part of the Maungdaw area close to the border and not allowed to resettle some formerly Muslim-majority areas.
""We Rakhine don’t want them to come back at all, but we understand there's international pressure,"" he said, adding anyone who does return should be placed in ""certain secure locations"".

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban have appointed five former commanders who spent more than a decade as prisoners in Guantanamo Bay as members of the political office in Qatar where they will take part in any future peace talks, officials in the movement said.
The five commanders, Mohammad Fazl, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Noorullah Noori, were held for 12 years in the U.S. detention center before being released in 2012 as part of a prisoner exchange in return for U.S. soldier Berg Bergdahl.
They were settled in Qatar following their release but until now had not been directly involved in political activities, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said.
The appointments were made as momentum gathers for talks to end 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
Qatar has emerged as a principal contact point between the Taliban and the U.S. government. Earlier this month, Taliban officials met the recently appointed U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in the Qatari capital Doha, having already met Alice Wells, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia, there earlier in the year.
A Taliban official in Qatar said that while the former commanders, who were close to the movement's late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, had not been attached to the political office earlier, but the office has sought their opinions and advice in the past.
""They have been contributing to certain important matters in their private capacity. Now they are officially declared as members of the Qatar-based political council and would represent Taliban movement in peace talks with the foreign leaders,"" said a member of the Taliban political office in Qatar.
Requesting anonymity, the official said the five Taliban leaders had been subject to restrictions on movement earlier, but they would now be able to travel and attend peace negotiations.
The appointments follow the release by Pakistan last week of senior Taliban figure Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

President Joko Widodo said he called Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, to lodge a protest and demand to know why Indonesia had not been informed about the execution of the woman, Tuti Tursilawati.
""We have called Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and conveyed our protest,"" Widodo was quoted as saying by the office of his cabinet secretary.
Tursilawati, who was working in the city of Ta'if, was found guilty of killing her employer in June 2011.
Indonesian advocacy group Migrant Care said in September that the mother of one had been defending herself from being raped.
The office of the cabinet secretary cited the Migrant Care assertion.
The Saudi ambassador to Indonesia had been summoned to discuss the matter, the president said. 
The Saudi embassy in Jakarta did not answer calls seeking comment.
""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has ignored principles of human rights, including a right for everyone to live,"" said Abidin Fikri, a member of Indonesia's parliament.
Indonesia, which is the world's biggest Muslim-majority country and generally enjoys good ties with Saudi Arabia, also has the death penalty for certain crimes. 

Indonesia has asked Saudi Arabia several times to improve protection of its workers there, including this month when Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met al-Jubeir in Jakarta.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>","As Brazil shifts right, its leftists search for a way forward","By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The victory of Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has battered the country's leftist Workers Party, which is now looking for a way to rebuild. 
After defining Brazilian politics for much of the past two decades, the party is still ruled by its imprisoned 73-year-old founder, threatened by internal divisions and concentrated in a region far from the center of economic power.
The damage goes beyond the drubbing voters delivered to the party's presidential candidate Fernando Haddad, who lost by a 10-percentage-point margin in Sunday's election.
For millions of Brazilians, the PT, as the Workers Party is known, has become synonymous with corruption and mismanagement. PT governments in recent years presided over the biggest bribery scandal in the nation's history and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Street crime has also exploded.
The backlash has been severe. Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - whom Barack Obama once dubbed ""the most popular politician on Earth"" - sits in a prison cell, serving a 12-year sentence for graft and money laundering. Lula's hand-picked successor, former President Dilma Rousseff, was impeached for fudging public accounts.
Angry voters responded by throwing their support to Bolsonaro, including sizeable numbers of low-income workers, Afro-Brazilians and university students who were long the PT's core supporters. The bombastic former Army captain tapped into their fury, vowing to crack down on criminals, be they in the streets or in the halls of Congress.
Even some voters nervous about Bolsonaro - who has urged police to shoot to kill and vowed to jail or drive his political foes out of the country - chose him as an insurance policy to keep the PT from returning to power.
Brazilian hip-hop icon Mano Brown chastised party leadership as being out of touch with voters at a star-studded concert and PT rally in Rio de Janeiro just days before Sunday's wipeout.
""There is no reason for us to celebrate,"" Brown told the crowd as stunned dignitaries, including Haddad and famed singer-songwriters Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, looked on. ""If you can't speak the people's language, you're going to lose big."" 
'PROJECT FOR POWER'
Corruption in Brazilian politics existed long before the PT was formed in 1980 to unite union workers, artists and intellectuals to help end Brazil's 1964-1985 dictatorship.
All of the country's major political parties, not just the PT, are implicated in the so-called Operation Car Wash investigation that ensnared Lula. PT loyalists say he and Rousseff were the victims of a right-wing ""coup"" that sought to discredit their leadership and undo social programs that lifted millions from poverty and gave minorities a seat at the table.
But even some PT stalwarts admit its rise from an opposition party to a governing one caused it to lose touch with its roots. Horse trading in the capital Brasilia became paramount for the party to stay on top, said Carlos Alberto Libanio Christo, a Roman Catholic priest and founding member of the PT who is known in Brazil as Frei Betto. 
""Gradually, the PT traded its project for Brazil in favor of a project for power,"" said Frei Betto, who spent four years imprisoned during the dictatorship. ""The party disappeared from the countryside and the poor urban outskirts.""
Another major challenge is that the PT is dwarfed by the towering presence of Lula, who still runs the show from jail.
Barred from running for another term due to his felony convictions, Lula tapped Haddad, the former mayor of Sao Paulo, as his stand-in, a gambit that failed miserably.
Lula loyalists, including Washington Quaquá, the head of the PT in Rio de Janeiro state, are sticking with Haddad despite his resounding defeat.
    ""Haddad came out of this election a great leader,"" Quaquá said. ""He emerged with the stature needed to be our national leader.""
But a militant faction of the PT is pushing for more aggressive leadership. Some grouse that Haddad, a mild-mannered political science professor at the elite University of Sao Paulo, is not tough enough to take on Bolsonaro.
Gleisi Hoffman, currently the president of the party, had resisted putting Haddad at the top of the ticket until Lula told her to fall in line, according to party members familiar with the internal debate. 
SEEKING SALVATION
The news for the PT is not entirely dismal.
The party won the most seats in the lower house on Sunday. It also took four governorships, more than any other party, although all were concentrated in Brazil's poor northeast, a traditional PT stronghold. 
After the shock of Bolsonaro's big win dissipates, the PT will unify and embrace its role as the resistance, with Haddad at the helm, predicted Alberto Almeida, the founder of Brasilis, a political and social analysis firm in Sao Paulo.
""After all, he did win 45 million votes,"" Almeida said.
He said the PT's mission will be to confront a challenge not seen since Brazil's return to democracy three decades ago: combating an ""extreme-right leader."" 
""In that way, the PT's role is similar to what the Democrats in the U.S. are facing with Trump,"" Almeida said. 
Haddad signaled as much in his concession speech in Sao Paulo, issuing a rallying cry to a movement in disarray.
""All of us here, who helped build one of the world's largest democracies, must maintain it in the face of provocations and threats,"" Haddad said. ""Have courage. The key to life is courage.""

The clashes since last Friday in the border have demonstrated the continuing threat from Islamic State, months after authorities on both sides of the frontier declared the militants had been effectively defeated.
Islamic State fighters, driven from nearly all the territory they once controlled on either side of the Syria-Iraqi border, launched one of this year's fiercest attacks on Friday against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said around 70 SDF fighters were killed in the assault, which Islamic State launched under cover of a sandstorm using suicide bombers and female jihadists. The SDF says it lost 14 fighters.
Iraq's Shi'ite paramilitaries, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), said in a statement on Wednesday they had killed two IS commanders in the border area who were responsible for the attack.
Ahmed Nasrallah, a PMF operations commander for western Anbar, said that the Iraqi military had provided information on militant gathering locations, and that a U.S.-led military coalition fighting against Islamic State had not attacked.
The coalition could not immediately be reached for comment.
Islamic State fighters, who once maintained a self-proclaimed caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, were pushed out of the towns and cities they controlled last year by a range of foes, including the U.S.-led coalition, the Iran-backed Iraqi militia, the Iraqi government and the Moscow-backed Syrian army.
Washington's main allies on the ground in Syria have been the SDF, which is led by a Kurdish militia. The United States has an estimated 2,000 special forces troops on the ground in Syria assisting them.
Iraqi Shi'ite militias reinforced their side of the border area in response to Friday's attack on the SDF in Syria, and Iraq's military said it was ready to take on any militants who tried to cross.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",What is next for Mexico City airport after mega project axed?,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A decision on Monday by Mexico's next president to scrap a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport has raised questions about the feasibility of his alternative plan, and consequences of the change.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, justified his move based on the results of an informal referendum that called for abandoning the current project. 
The U-turn is the latest step in a long-running saga over how to solve growing congestion at the Mexico City airport, where 40 million passengers pass through a year.
WHAT IS LOPEZ OBRADOR'S ALTERNATIVE PLAN?
Lopez Obrador aims to add two runways to the military air base at Santa Lucia, some 29 miles (47 km) by road north of the current facility, Benito Juarez International Airport, then connect the two. He said it can be done for 70 billion pesos ($3.5 billion).
The plan also envisions upgrading the Benito Juarez hub and Toluca International Airport 41 miles (66 km) away for about 5 billion pesos, and connect the latter by train to the capital. The projects would be completed in three years and altogether save some 100 billion pesos, according to Lopez Obrador.
WHAT ARE THE DOUBTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL?
Engineering consultancy Mitre Corporation said the Santa Lucia site may not be able to operate simultaneously with the Benito Juarez airport due to conflicting flight paths. Javier Jimenez Espriu, Lopez Obrador's designated transport minister, rejects that view.
The business community has argued that Santa Lucia's distance from the capital will deter tourism and could complicate travel for connecting flights from Mexico City.
WHAT ARE THE PLAN'S BENEFITS?
Lopez Obrador's team said the new airport being built on the bed of Lake Texcoco on the capital's eastern flank would be too expensive to maintain because of the complex geology.
Canceling it would avoid damage to the city's water table and benefit local ducks, Lopez Obrador said. He wants the Texcoco site to become an ecological park.
Without providing evidence, Lopez Obrador has said the Texcoco project was tainted by graft. He argues the cancellation of the project will send out a message in Mexico that corruption between business interests and politicians is over.
WHAT CONSEQUENCES COULD CANCELLATION TRIGGER?
By choosing to dump a project that has received billions of dollars in investment - the outgoing government said the Texcoco airport is about one-third complete - markets are reassessing Lopez Obrador's commitment to existing laws and agreements.
That could negatively affect Mexico's ability to attract investment under Lopez Obrador, who argues he has ""moral authority"" to call the present system into question.
Billions of dollars were wiped off the value of the stock market on Monday during a sell-off by investors.
The airport's cancellation may require the government to put up extra funds to pre-pay bonds issued to finance it, outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto said. The group building the Texcoco hub issued $6 billion in bonds and $1.5 billion in an investment trust, backed by the current airport passenger tax.
WILL FIRMS INVOLVED KEEP THEIR CONTRACTS?
Jimenez Espriu said companies already contracted by the airport group may be able to transfer their contracts to Santa Lucia, or reach new agreements. Lopez Obrador said he will honor existing agreements but has not provided details.
Among the business leaders most exposed to the cancellation of the Texcoco airport is the country's richest man, Carlos Slim, whose family has been co-designing, co-building and co-financing the project that began construction in 2015.

In a rare public sign of dissent Pete Wishart, an SNP lawmaker in Britain's national parliament, said in a newspaper column that supporting a second ""confirmatory"" referendum could undercut the SNP's goal of secession from the United Kingdom by inviting comparison. 
Infighting in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives is complicating her efforts to reach a deal in time for Brexit day on March 2019. The SNP, Scotland's biggest party, said this month it would back a second referendum on the issue -- although Scotland already voted to keep its EU membership in 2016.
Up to now the SNP had been one of the most unified parties on Brexit, supporting Britain's continued membership of the single market and customs union. 
""There is now a view amongst the politicians leading the ""People's Vote"" (second EU referendum) campaign that all big constitutional referendums should now have a ""confirmatory"" second vote,"" Wishart wrote in Scottish newspaper The National.
""By enthusiastically buying into this 'confirmatory' vote for an EU referendum we weaken our hand in resisting unionist calls for a second vote on a successful indyref (independence referendum)."" 
In the UK's 2016 referendum on EU membership, a majority of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the bloc, while England - by far the most populous of the home nations - and Wales voted to leave.

May has consistently ruled out the idea of a second Brexit referendum while Labour, whose ranks are also divided, has dithered over the issue.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","Japan's nuclear industry growing, but slower than government hoped","By Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's resurgent nuclear industry will miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country's electricity by 2030, a Reuters analysis shows.
With eight reactors running and one more set to come online in November, nuclear has this year overtaken non-hydro renewables in power output for the first time since the 2011 catastrophe, when all of the country's nuclear plants were idled.
Yet operators can expect as few as six units to restart in the next five years, and fewer than 20 by 2030, the analysis shows. That is far short of the 30 needed to meet the government target reiterated this year. 
Based on the analysis, the world's third-largest economy may get about 15 percent of its power from nuclear in 2030, compared with a government target of 20-22 percent. 
""It's impossible to meet the target, that's pretty much confirmed,"" said Takeo Kikkawa, an energy studies professor at Tokyo University of Science, who sat on an official panel that reviewed Japan's energy policy this year.
He said he did not expect another round of restarts before 2020.
One major trading house predicts nuclear will account for 14 percent of power production in 2030, according to a presentation given at a private seminar this year and shown to Reuters.
Nuclear remains an unpopular energy option in Japan and the country will reboot only a fraction of the 54 reactors it had before the disaster.
Six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi are being dismantled in a decades-long exercise that is fraught with technological challenges and radioactive waste. Operators have decided to decommission another 10 units across the country since Fukushima.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority created new safety standards from scratch after the disaster highlighted failings in the industry and its overseers. All reactors must be relicensed before restarting. 
Yet Japan's nuclear industry, which before Fukushima operated the world's third-largest number of reactors and provided about 30 percent of the country's electricity, has staged a significant recovery.
The turnaround has exceeded expectations of analysts and the utilities themselves. Kansai Electric Power and Kyushu Electric Power, for instance, have won approval to restart or are on course to win approval for all the reactors they applied to relicense. 
Those units are far from Tokyo and are pressurized water reactors (PWR), unlike the boiling water reactor (BWR) designs favored in eastern Japan, including those that melted down at Fukushima. 
Many court cases are pending for reactors in the east of the country. Local political support varies, and the regulator is locked in disputes with operators over earthquake risk assessment.
The older BWR technology used in many of the reactors under review is also an issue because the stigma of Fukushima hangs over them.
""When you come to the BWRs, the issue becomes very politicized,"" said Nobuo Tanaka, the chairman of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation who was the head of the International Energy Agency between 2007 and 2011 after a stint in Japan's industry ministry.
The reputation of Tepco, which operates two nuclear plants that have been damaged in natural disasters, also looms large, Tanaka said.
""Tepco does not have any support as a nuclear operator,"" he said. The utility has to be removed from the equation before progress on BWR reactors can be made, he said. 
Tepco has reached the first stage of approval, but faces strong opposition from local residents. But Japan's utility lobby group said progress was being made. 
""The safety reviews of PWR plants took time but they have been progressing steadily and there have been some developments in the BWR category as well,"" Satoru Katsuno, the chairman of Japan's federation of electric utilities and president of Chubu Electric, said of the outlook for restart approvals.
Chubu Electric has been locked in a dispute for years with the regulator over disaster resilience measures at its Hamaoka plant, which uses BWR reactors. 
The analysis suggests that Japan will rely on fossil fuels, particularly liquefied natural gas and coal, as the pace of renewables expansion slows. That will make it harder to meet its emissions targets under international agreement. 
The government estimates costs for replacement fuel – mostly liquefied natural gas - to compensate for idled reactors totaled 14.6 trillion yen ($130 billion) across the industry in the six years through March.
The lack of realistic energy targets makes it harder for the industry to plan for investment, utility officials say.
And the issue of disaster resilience is not going away: a big earthquake struck the northern island of Hokkaido in September and left a nuclear plant reliant on backup generators.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian search and rescue workers believe they have found the fuselage of a Lion Air passenger jet that crashed with 189 people on board, and are also trying to confirm the origin of an underwater ""ping"" signal, officials said on Wednesday.
Ground staff lost touch with flight JT610 of Indonesian budget airline Lion Air 13 minutes after the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 took off early on Monday from Jakarta, on its way to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
There were no survivors.
Indonesia's military chief said he believed the plane had been located, and a transport safety official said divers would be sent to confirm the origin of a ""ping"" signal picked up by a search and rescue team late on Tuesday.
""We strongly believe that we have found a part of the fuselage,"" armed forces chief Hadi Tjahjanto told broadcaster TV One.
Speaking on board the navy ship KRI Rigel, navy official Colonel Haris Djoko Nugroho told broadcaster TVOne that a 22-meter long object had been found in waters about 32 meters deep, and a sonar was being used to identify it. 
Divers would also be sent to check, he said.
The Rigel has been searching in an area about 5 nautical miles from the site where the aircraft lost contact.
The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's single-aisle jet.
The plane's blackboxes, as the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are known, should help explain why the almost-new jet went down minutes after take-off.
Amid media speculation over the airworthiness of the aircraft, the transport minister suspended Lion Air's technical director and several technicians to facilitate the crash investigation.
The suspended technicians ""issued the recommendations for that flight"", the ministry said in a press release. It did not say how many technicians had been suspended.
QUESTIONS
An official of the national transport safety panel has said the plane had technical problems on its previous flight on Sunday, from the city of Denpasar on the resort island of Bali, including an issue over ""unreliable airspeed"".
Privately owned Lion Air, founded in 1999, said the aircraft had been in operation since August and was airworthy. The pilot and co-pilot had 11,000 hours of flying time between them, it said.
Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait has acknowledged reports of technical problems with the aircraft, but said maintenance had been carried out ""according to procedure"" before it was cleared for flight again.
Investigators are looking into why the pilot had asked to return to base shortly after take-off, a request that ground control officials had granted, although the flight crashed soon after. 
They will also question pilots who flew the same aircraft from Bali to Jakarta on Sunday.

The airline is to meet a team from Boeing on Wednesday to discuss the fate of the plane.

KEVADIA, India (Reuters) - India on Wednesday inaugurated the world's tallest statue, a $400-million effigy of independence hero Vallabhbhai Patel that towers nearly twice the height of New York's Statue of Liberty.
The 182-metre (597-ft) steel and bronze ""Statue of Unity"", in the prime minister's western home state of Gujarat, is part of his Hindu nationalist party's efforts to re-brand what it calls ""forgotten"" leaders.
""Patel wanted India to be a forceful, strong, sensitive, vigilant and accommodative nation, and we're working toward that,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at Wednesday's ceremony.
Modi, who ordered the statue built on the Narmada river when he was Gujarat chief minister, said last year there had been efforts to ""belittle"" or ""remove from history"" the contributions of Patel, who helped unite India's 562 princely states as the first home, or interior, minister. 
Funds for the statue came from the federal government, state-run companies and other institutions, and it was built in 33 months by construction and engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
Depicting the bald Patel in traditional attire, with a shawl over the shoulders, the statue used 210,000 cubic meters of cement, 25,000 tonnes of steel and 1,700 tonnes of bronze.
Some of the leaders Modi has branded as ""forgotten"" came from the opposition Congress party, and fought for independence from colonial ruler Britain in 1947.
Facing five state elections and a general election due by May, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are reaching back into history for alternatives to the heroes of the Nehru-Gandhi family that dominated Congress. [nL3N1X107Z]
The BJP says Congress has deliberately ignored leaders such as Patel, B.R. Ambedkar, who led the drafting of the constitution, and freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose.
The accusations are a distortion of history, says Congress, which ruled India for much of its independence history and is now led by Rahul Gandhi, the great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. 
""Ironic that a statue of Sardar Patel is being inaugurated, but every institution he helped build is being smashed,"" Gandhi said on social network Twitter, using an honorific for Patel.
""The systematic destruction of India's institutions is nothing short of treason.""
Some political commentators have criticized Modi for his expenditure on the statue complex at a time when the adivasi indigenous people who farm the land acquired for it are in economic straits and have protested against it.
""You would surely ask, on whose land would this statue stand? Whose plan was this?"" social activist Medha Patkar wrote in what she called an open letter to Patel.
""This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to adivasis.""

The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran socialist has won over many voters with his promises to re-nationalize services and increase public spending, is neck-and-neck with the Conservative Party in opinion polls, meaning they could form the next government.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>","Public opinion, legal hurdles cloud outlook for Japan-South Korea forced labor row","By Linda Sieg and Hyonhee Shin
TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea will try to keep a row over World War Two forced laborers from spiraling into a crisis, after a court ruling forced the U.S. allies to confront hardening public opinion and divergent views of history.
South Korea's top court ruled on Tuesday that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401.T) must compensate four South Koreans for their wartime forced labor, a binding verdict Japan denounced as ""unthinkable"" while expressing hope it would not hurt the uneasy neighbors' cooperation on North Korea.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and her Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, stressed in a Wednesday telephone call the need to keep cooperating ""for the future oriented development of the relationship"", South Korea's foreign ministry said.
The two countries need to cooperate to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile program, and they also have close business ties. Japanese firms invested $1.84 billion in South Korea last year, its second largest foreign investor, Korean data show.
But relations have long been plagued by the legacy of Japan's 1910-45 colonizations of the peninsula and the war, including the matter of ""comfort women"", a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japanese wartime military brothels.
""The sentiments of compromise are in short supply in both countries,"" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University's Japan campus.
""Basically, across the political spectrum, Koreans feel Japan has inadequately addressed the wounds of the past,"" he said. 
""Japan feels it has already resolved the issue legally and they don't want to show flexibility because it would open up a Pandora's box of claims"" against other Japanese firms.
There are 14 similar lawsuits pending against firms including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T) and Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co Ltd (5706.T). 
Two are class action suits with a total 752 plaintiffs.
South Korea says there were nearly 150,000 victims of wartime forced labor, 5,000 of whom are alive, but families of those who have died can also make a claim.
Japan has threatened to seek international arbitration of the dispute, but Kono told reporters it would wait to see what steps South Korean President Moon Jae-in's government takes.
""We're just starting to explore next steps, with a task force to be created under the prime minister with private experts too,"" a South Korean government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""It's really difficult, but we need to come up with a wise idea that can minimize the consequences.""
OPTIONS
Japan says the compensation issue was settled by a 1965 treaty normalizing ties. 
Past South Korean governments have agreed, but the Supreme Court said the treaty left open the door for individuals to seek recompense.
Moon's government has said it would respect the court's decision.
Some experts in Japan said one option could be for South Korea to create a fund to compensate former laborers, perhaps with financing from companies in both countries.
South Korean firms benefited from Japanese aid under the 1965 treaty, overseen by South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee.
Few funds went to individuals, and forced laborers began to come forward in the 1990s. 
In 2000, the German government and companies set up a forced labor fund to compensate Hitler-era victims, a format some experts said could be a model for Japan - although whether Japanese firms would be willing to contribute is not clear.
South Korean officials expressed doubts. The legally binding nature of the Supreme Court ruling appears to restrict the scope for diplomatic maneuvering, while on both sides there's a risk of public anger.
""Any Japan-related historical legacy issues are highly political and could rekindle anti-Japan sentiment,"" said former South Korean national security adviser Chun Yung-woo.
""There would be heated debate as to what responsibilities the government and those companies that benefited from the Japanese funds decades ago bear,"" he said.
A rightward shift in Japan mirrored in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative agenda could also hamper a solution.
""Unfortunately, the present government in Japan is run by people who believe the post-war is over and therefore they see remembering the unpleasant past as damaging to the dignity of the state,"" said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Japan's Josai International University and expert in historical reconciliation issues. 
""Their support base is clear on that.""

Taliban insurgents fighting the Western-backed government said they shot it down.
Two army helicopters were on their way from Farah province to neighboring Herat when one lost control in low visibility and crashed into a mountain, Naser Mehri, a spokesman for the provincial governor, told Reuters.
Among the passengers were Nematullah Khalil, deputy army corps commander for the western region, and Farid Bakhtawar, the outspoken head of Farah's provincial council. The other victims, apart from the crew, were soldiers and council members, Mehri said.
Bakhtawar was a major figure in battling the Taliban in the battle for the city of Farah which the militants besieged and threatened to take over in May. 
The Taliban are seeking to remove the government and reimpose strict Islamic law after their ouster by U.S.-led forces in 2001.
A suicide bomber blew himself up near the gate of Afghanistan's largest prison on Wednesday, killing at least six people, officials said, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The sprawling Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul houses hundreds of inmates, including scores of Taliban.
Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the attacker detonated his explosive near a vehicle carrying prison employees. 
Six people died near the gate of the prison on the eastern outskirts of the city and eight were wounded, another government official said.
""The attacker walked towards a vehicle that was parked at a gate for security clearance. He blew himself up before the vehicle could enter the prison premises,"" the official said. 

An Afghan news website said women security officials were in the vehicle at the time of the attack.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 03:20AM ET</span>",Uzbek bloggers test - and hit - the limits of new-found freedom,"By Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov
TASHKENT (Reuters) - When Uzbek authorities detained several online activists in September, blogger Davronbek Tojialiyev packed some clothes in a bag and waited for the knock on his door.
The police never came, and Tojialiyev, one of a handful of bloggers breaking taboos by criticizing state policies and officials, writes on.
The 34-year-old's experience suggests the new government in Tashkent is willing to make concessions as it vows to ease restrictions that made Uzbeks wary of speaking freely for the past 25 years.
The detention of the bloggers, however, shows the change has limits, even as Uzbekistan tries to project a more liberal image to foreign investors whose help it needs to revive the economy after years of stagnation.
The government is still sensitive to challenges to its authority, including in the sphere of religion.
The country was rocked by bombings in the late 1990s and early 2000s that were blamed on Islamist extremists, and by an armed uprising in 2005 in which hundreds of people were killed.
Tojialiyev says that mixed messages from the state on freedom of expression are unlikely to stop people like him from pushing the boundaries.
""I was not afraid (of arrest) but I was ready for it,"" he said with a smile.
Public criticism of the government was unthinkable under former president Islam Karimov, who ran the majority Muslim former Soviet republic from 1989 until his death in 2016.
Critics such as journalist Yusuf Ruzimuradov spent years in prison on charges related to public security and inciting rebellion. Ruzimuradov was released last March after 19 years behind bars.
""During Karimov's time bloggers could write only about small issues, mostly social,"" said Tojialiyev, whose day job is running Ziyouz.uz, a catalog of Uzbek literature. ""It was not possible to talk about serious and political subjects."" 
Karimov's successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has proclaimed a new era of openness and freedom of the press, and moved to curb the powers of the security forces.
""I regard as real journalists the ones who expose ... bureaucracy, indifference, extortion, corruption,"" he said in remarks published by his office last year.
""There needs to be plurality of opinions in the national media space,"" he said.
The foreign ministry, which answers all queries from the international media including to the police, did not reply to a request for comment on this story.
Mirziyoyev's approach has improved Uzbekistan's image abroad and helped it start rebuilding ties with institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which had in effect withdrawn from the country under Karimov.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross praised ""the successful political and democratic reforms that are underway in Uzbekistan"" on a visit to Tashkent last week.
""...the types of reforms the President has embraced here are essential to establishing the certitude that companies need to open operations in the local economy,"" he told an American-Uzbek Chamber of Commerce Business Forum.
Bordering Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the country of 33 million produces gold, natural gas and oil. One of its selling points to foreign investors is as a stepping stone between Russia and China.
Some of the government's steps have been clumsy, however.
Journalists from Russia who visited Tashkent this month as members of President Vladimir Putin's media pool, including a Reuters reporter, were instructed not to leave their hotels without official minders ""for their own safety"".
YOUNG AND RELIGIOUS
The Uzbek blogosphere has expanded since the election in December 2016 of Mirziyoyev, who was prime minister under Karimov. 
Bloggers, writing mostly on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), question policies they see as excessively strict or unnecessary. Mirziyoyev himself has a Facebook page, as do many senior officials, although less than 3 percent of Uzbeks regularly visit Facebook.
One story that went viral was that of a young teacher killed by a truck while cleaning up a highway ahead of a presidential visit last March, part of a mass mobilization of public sector workers by provincial authorities.
Mirziyoyev quickly responded to the outcry, telling reporters he felt responsible for the woman's death and ordering his subordinates to stop what he called ""window-dressing"".
""Bloggers have become the moving force, not only in social networks but in society as well,"" Tojialiyev said. ""If they raise certain issues the government is forced to address them.""
In several cases, authorities have punished low-level officials after bloggers helped spread news of abuse of power, such as a district mayor filmed beating headmasters for failing to bring enough people to a national holiday event.
On Monday, Mirziyoyev sacked a deputy PM who was criticized on social media after a photo showed his subordinates standing knee-deep in a ditch full of water as a punishment. The announcement did not mention the photo but it follows an online outcry.
BOLDER AFTER SUCCESS
It was successes like these that emboldened about a dozen young male bloggers, mainly focused on religious issues, to criticize a draft of school uniform regulations in June that disallowed hijabs, headscarves prescribed in Islam for girls and women.
After the government enacted the regulations in August, bloggers cried foul and some called for protests. They were joined by Fazliddin Parpiyev, imam of one of Tashkent's mosques.
The pushback was swift. Police arrested at least eight bloggers and the imam was dismissed. Parpiyev told Reuters he remains out of work after refusing to apologize.
One of the detained bloggers, Adham Olimov, told Reuters a court sentenced him to 15 days of administrative arrest on charges of disobeying police orders. He and others were out of jail by mid-September.
""Things have improved ... Under Karimov, we would have been sent to prison for 15-20 years,"" said another blogger who asked not to be named so as to avoid further problems.
""(But) I am now avoiding sensitive issues. I have a family ... Blogging is not worth going to jail for."" 
Tojialiyev said he would continue to write about the school uniform issue, however, and criticized the response as going against the spirit of liberal reforms.
""There was no official explanation or response from the government on what was going on,"" he said.
""We live in a democratic society or we claim to have one, but what happened was not in line with our claim - for example, arresting bloggers on trumped-up charges, not informing relatives about the whereabouts of the detainees and so on.""
Tojialiyev said he has not experienced any pressure or intimidation from the authorities, but friends have tried to persuade him to be more careful about sensitive issues.
""We can no longer see the bravery and fury which used to be there (in the blogosphere) months ago,"" he says. ""Bloggers have once again started writing about minor and old matters.""
While Tojialiyev's optimism may have wavered, his determination has not.
""I know that what I am doing is not a crime and perhaps that's why I am not afraid. Also, public and international pressure is a factor now. Maybe this gives me some confidence.""

259,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2018 03:06AM ET</span>",Pakistan frees Christian woman facing death in blasphemy case,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the conviction of a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy against Islam and ordered her freed, a ruling that set off protests by hardline Islamists but was welcomed by human rights advocates.
Asia Bibi, a mother of four, has been living on death row since 2010 when she became the first woman to be sentenced to death by hanging under Pakistan's draconian blasphemy laws. 
She was condemned for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
Bibi has always denied blaspheming.
Bibi's case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, where two politicians who sought to help Bibi were assassinated.
Supporters of Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP), which was founded to support Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws, immediately condemned the ruling and blocked roads in Karachi, the country's largest city, and in the city of Lahore.
The TLP threatened to paralyses cities if Bibi's conviction was overturned.
Chief Justice Saqib Nasir, who headed a special three-person bench set up for the appeal, cited the Koran in his ruling, writing ""Tolerance is the basic principle of Islam"" and noting the religion condemns injustice and oppression.
""It is great news for Pakistan and rest of the world,"" Bibi’s lawyer Saiful Mulook told Reuters. “Asia Bibi has finally been served justice. ... Pakistan’s Supreme Court must be appreciated that it upheld the law of the land and didn't succumb to any pressure.""
Bibi's case has been high on the agenda of religious hardliners in Pakistan, many of whom are fiercely opposed to her release.
In November, TLP staged a crippling blockade of the capital, Islamabad, after small changes to a religious oath, which it claims was tantamount to blasphemy. Seven people were killed and more than 200 wounded in clashes with the police and TLP's supporters only dispersed after striking a deal with the military. 
Insulting Islam's prophet is punishable by death under Pakistani law, and blasphemy accusations stir such emotions that they are almost impossible to defend against. Dozens have been killed following blasphemy claims, sometimes by mobs of men.
Rights groups say the blasphemy law is exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores. The law does not clearly define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence.
Bibi's representatives have claimed she was involved in a dispute with her neighbors and that her accusers had contradicted themselves.
In February, Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih and one of her daughters met with Pope Francis shortly before Rome's ancient Colosseum was lit in red one evening in solidarity with persecuted Christians, and Bibi in particular.
Pope Francis told Bibi's daughter: ""I think often of your mother and I pray for her"".
Christians make up only about 2 percent of Pakistan's population and are sometimes discriminated against.
“This is a landmark verdict. For the past eight years, Asia Bibi’s life languished in limbo,"" said Omar Waraich, deputy South Asia director for Amnesty International. 

""The message must go out that the blasphemy laws will no longer be used to persecute the country’s most vulnerable minorities.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan bestowed names on Wednesday to two newly-hatched young of New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi, in the northeastern town of Rotorua, on the final day of their two-week tour of the Pacific.
The couple visited a breeding program for the endangered species and admired two three-day old chicks, whom they named Koha, meaning ""gift"", and Tihei, derived from a phrase that means ""sneeze of life"" in the indigenous Te Reo Maori language.
Earlier, Harry led a group at a Maori meeting ground in singing ""Te Aroha"", a traditional song, whose name means ""Love"" in Te Reo.
The couple were welcomed at Te Papaiouru Marae, visited by Harry's grandmother Queen Elizabeth in her coronation year of 1953, in Rotorua, a town famed for its geothermal activity and described by its mayor as the 'heartland of Maori culture'. 
Meghan, who wore a navy Stella McCartney dress and a carved greenstone necklace gifted by the country's governor general and Harry, in a grey suit, were both adorned with feathered cloaks gifted by local Maori.
Harry began his speech in the Te Reo language and ended it with a Maori proverb, drawing applause from the crowd with his strong pronunciation. Then he led the song.
His enthusiasm for the Maori language was welcomed by Rotorua Mayor Steve Chadwick, who said, ""As our confidence as a bilingual district grows, so does our confidence in our people and our future.""
The use of Te Reo Maori language is experiencing a revival in New Zealand, after years of decline when policy makers cracked down on its use, particularly in schools. 
Free Maori language courses often report being booked out and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said her infant daughter Neve Te Aroha will learn it alongside English.
Later, with Meghan wearing black puffa jacket, black trousers and flat shoes and Harry in a black shirt and beige chinos, they visited a tree-top canopy in a redwood tree forest, followed by a walkabout meeting with some of the public.
A group of children gave an impromptu haka, a traditional war dance made famous by New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team.
A toddler wandered toward Harry through the metal barricades holding back the crowds, but the prince quickly sought out his family and directed him back. 

The couple, who are expecting their first child in the northern spring, were set to leave New Zealand for London on Thursday, after a 16-day tour that also covered Australia, Fiji and Tonga.

Washington does not have diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is its main arms supplier and strongest international backer.
This month, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen vowed to boost national security and said her government would not submit to Chinese suppression. 
""Any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means...is of grave concern to the United States,"" Brent Christensen, the director of the United States' de facto embassy in Taipei, told reporters. He did not elaborate. 
China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has boosted military and diplomatic pressure on Taipei. 
The Chinese military has stepped up encirclement drills around Taiwan, which the island has denounced as intimidation, and three former allies, El Salvador, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic, switched ties to Beijing this year. 
The United States' new $256-million representative office in Taiwan's capital is an ""important symbol"" of their partnership, Christensen said, adding that Washington would keep backing Taiwan's ""substantive role"" in the international community. 
China has been infuriated by recent U.S. sanctions on its military, among several flashpoints in ties ranging from a bitter trade war and the issue of Taiwan to China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.
Last week, the United States sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait in its second such operation this year, despite opposition from China.
In Beijing, a spokesman for China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said the Taiwan issue was about China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
""We resolutely opposed any official exchanges or military contacts between the U.S. side and the Taiwan region,"" Ma Xiaoguang told a regular news briefing shortly before Christensen's comments. 

""I would like here to stress again - the consequences will be reaped by relying on foreigners to build yourselves up, or colluding with foreign forces to damage peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he added, referring to Taiwan's government.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's spy agency has observed preparations by North Korea for international inspections at several of its nuclear and missile test sites, the Yonhap news agency said on Wednesday, citing a South Korean lawmaker.
Kim Min-ki of the ruling Democratic Party told reporters that intelligence officials had observed what they believed to be preparations for possible inspections at Punggye-ri nuclear test site and the Sohae Satellite launching ground.
The South's National Intelligence Service observed North Koreans ""conducting preparation and intelligence activities that seem to be in preparation for foreign inspectors’ visit,"" the lawmaker added, but no major movements were seen at Yongbyon. 
Yongbyon is the North's main nuclear complex.
North Korea has stopped nuclear and missile tests in the past year, but it did not allow international inspections of its dismantling of Punggye-ri in May, drawing criticism that the action was merely for show and could be reversed.
In September, its leader Kim Jong Un pledged at a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to also close Sohae and allow experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad.
At the time, Moon said North Korea agreed to let international inspectors observe a ""permanent dismantlement"" of key missile facilities, and take further steps, such as closing Yongbyon, in return for reciprocal moves by the United States. 
Washington has demanded steps such as a full disclosure of the North’s nuclear and missile facilities, before agreeing to Pyongyang’s key goals, including an easing of international sanctions and an official end to the Korean War.

American officials have been skeptical of Kim's commitment to giving up nuclear weapons, but the North’s pledge at the summit with the South drew an enthusiastic response from President Donald Trump.

In a statement, Pompeo said missile and drone strikes by Iran-allied Houthi rebels against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates should stop, and the Saudi-led coalition must cease air strikes in all populated areas of Yemen.
Yemen is one of the poorest Arab countries and faces the world's worst humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by a nearly four-year-old war that pits the Houthis against the internationally recognized government backed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the West.
""The time is now for the cessation of hostilities, including missile and UAV strikes from Houthi-controlled areas into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,"" Pompeo said, using an acronym for unmanned aerial vehicles.
""Subsequently, Coalition air strikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,"" he added.
The United States helps the coalition by refueling its jets and providing training in targeting. Pompeo said last month that he had certified to the U.S. Congress that Saudi Arabia and the UAE were working to reduce civilian casualties in Yemen.
Three-quarters of Yemen's population, or 22 million people, require aid and 8.4 million people are on the brink of starvation.
U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths said earlier this month that the United Nations hoped to resume consultations between the warring sides by November.
Both Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis voiced support for the U.N. effort.
Mattis, addressing a forum in Washington on Tuesday, defended U.S. efforts to help reduce casualties by the Saudi-led coalition and said all sides needed to take meaningful steps toward a ceasefire and negotiations in the next 30 days.
Mattis added that the Saudis and Emiratis appeared ready to embrace efforts by Griffiths to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.
“We’ve got to move toward a peace effort here. And we can’t say we’re going to do it sometime in the future. We need to be doing this in the next 30 days,” Mattis said. 
Pompeo said the consultations planned by Griffiths should start in November ""to implement confidence-building measures to address the underlying issues of the conflict, the demilitarization of borders, and the concentration of all large weapons under international observation.""

A cessation of hostilities and resumption of a political track would help ease the humanitarian crisis, Pompeo said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. general overseeing a deployment of more than 5,200 troops to the border with Mexico said on Tuesday that troop levels would rise further, but declined to say how high or estimate what the operation will cost.
Many basic questions remained unanswered a day after the Pentagon announced the open-ended deployment of over 5,200 active-duty troops to the border, including the scope of the mission as well as the Pentagon's assessment of any threat posed by arriving migrants.
President Donald Trump has hardened his stance on immigration ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections. He has drawn attention to a caravan of migrants that is trekking through Mexico toward the United States as he seeks to fire up support for his Republican party, which is facing some tough battles as Democrats seek to wrest control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
Republican lawmakers and other Trump supporters have applauded the deployment. But critics say Trump is politicizing the military, deploying them as a stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls without any real national security threat.
General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, defended the operation at a briefing on Tuesday. He echoed Trump administration concerns about the caravan and compared the border support mission to other domestic military missions, like hurricane relief. 
""I firmly believe that border security is national security,"" O'Shaughnessy said.
The U.S. military still had no firm idea of what the operation would cost, he added. Pentagon officials have said the Defense Department will need to find a way to pay for the operation, suggesting money may need to be taken from other national security programs.
O'Shaughnessy said that just over 1,000 troops had deployed to Texas as of Tuesday, where they will carry out tasks like building barriers, erecting tents, and flying government personnel by helicopter to and from different locations along the border.
He said the troops now slated to go to Texas, Arizona and California were only the start of a larger deployment and that eventually troops would go to New Mexico as well.
""What I can confirm is there will be additional force over and above the 5,239. The magnitude of that difference, I don't have the answer for now,"" he said.
The projected U.S. deployment is already roughly the same size as the U.S. military contingent in Iraq. 
Trump railed against illegal immigration to win the 2016 presidential election and has seized on the caravan of Central American migrants at campaign rallies in the run-up to next week's vote.
Trump has characterized the migrants as an ""invasion"" and falsely stated they harbor terrorists and are financed in part by Democrats.
O'Shaughnessy declined to comment on intelligence about the caravan when asked whether there were terrorists among the migrants. He said the caravan was ""different"" than those seen by the United States in the past, adding that they were better organized. 
""We've seen violence coming out of the caravan,"" O'Shaughnessy said.
Mexico's government said on Tuesday that it had deported two Honduran men for whom there were arrest warrants back home, one for homicide, the other for a drug-related offense. The two men, ages 21 and 47, crossed into Mexico with the migrant caravan in the state of Chiapas.

Kevin McAleenan, the U.S. commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, estimated on Monday that the caravan was comprised of about 3,500 migrants.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Norwegian diplomat Geir Pedersen will be the new United Nations Syria envoy, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council in a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said Pedersen, now Norway's ambassador to China, had the informal approval of the council's permanent five members - Russia, China, the United States, France and Britain.
""In taking this decision, I have consulted broadly, including with the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic,"" Guterres wrote. ""Mr. Pedersen will support the Syrian parties by facilitating an inclusive and credible political solution that meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.""
Pedersen will replace Staffan de Mistura when he steps down for family reasons at the end of November, quitting as the Syrian government - backed by Iran and Russia - has retaken most of the country and a political deal remains elusive.
The Norwegian diplomat faces obstacles in negotiating a political deal, which the West has said is needed to unlock its reconstruction support and to encourage the bulk of the millions of refugees in Europe and the Middle East to return.
United Nations efforts are currently focused on trying to convene a committee to rewrite Syria's constitution. 
De Mistura told the Security Council on Friday that Syria wants the United Nations to simply facilitate efforts to rewrite the constitution and not choose a third of the committee that will do it, presenting a ""serious challenge.""
De Mistura is the longest serving of three U.N. mediators during the more than seven-year-old Syrian conflict after more than four years in the job. His predecessors - former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi - both quit in frustration.
Pedersen has also served as Norway's ambassador to the United Nations. In 2005, he replaced de Mistura as then-U.N. chief Annan's personal representative in southern Lebanon.
He has also worked on the Middle East peace process for both the United Nations and Norway. 
According to a U.N. biography: ""In 1993, he was a member of the Norwegian team to the secret Oslo negotiations that led to the signing of the Declaration of Principles and the mutual recognition between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.""

Italian media said forensic scientists were looking to see if the remains might be those of Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee who vanished in 1983.
The Vatican said in a statement that the bone fragments were discovered during restructuring work on an annex to the Holy See's imposing embassy compound near Rome's famous Villa Borghese museum.
It said chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone was leading the investigation and had tasked forensic specialists with determining the ""age, sex and date of death"" of the body.
Orlandi's fate is one of the biggest mysteries in modern Italian history.
Her disappearance was initially linked to a possible attempt by unknown persons to win freedom for Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was then serving a life sentence in an Italian jail. 
In 2005, an anonymous caller to a television talk show said the secret to her kidnap was buried along with Enrico “Renatino” De Pedis, a mobster who once led the feared Magliana gang which terrorized Rome in the 1980s.
Police eventually opened his tomb in a Rome basilica in 2012 looking for clues but came up empty handed.
The Vatican statement made no mention of Orlandi.

NILTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - An impoverished Mexican town nearly flattened by a 2017 earthquake welcomed thousands of tired and hungry Central Americans in a U.S.-bound caravan this week in quiet defiance of U.S. President Donald Trump's condemnation of the group.
On Monday, the same day that Trump ordered 5,200 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to block the migrants, residents of the southern town of Niltepec, who still live among piles of rubble that once were their homes, prepared for the caravan with homemade soup, medical tents, and diapers for children.
""We wish we had a space dignified enough to offer our visitors,"" said Zelfareli Cruz Medina, Niltepec's mayor.
As she spoke, caravan members were stringing up garbage bags to use as tents in Niltepec's main square. Surrounding buildings were scarred with cracks and gaping holes caused by the 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck the region on Sept. 7, 2017.
Of 1,720 homes in Niltepec, 1,602 were damaged in the quake, according to town officials, while 530 collapsed entirely. At least 100 families are still without homes, they said.
A tower atop Niltepec's main church was stripped down to its fragile wood skeleton by the quake and Cruz said the town needed help to rebuild its library and the mayor's offices, which were serving as a shelter for the caravan's women and children.
But a willingness to help the needy comes as almost second-nature to residents of the hardscrabble town in Oaxaca, one of Mexico's poorest states, Cruz said. ""We know now what it means to suffer,"" she said.
Near the church, three local families gathered at lunchtime in the shared backyard of rebuilt homes to cook an offering of chicken soup for the migrants, many of whom have said they are fleeing violence and grinding poverty in their homeland.
Later Monday evening, Mariela Escobar, 52, a part-time cleaner, pored over a vat of fuming tamales - ""hundreds of them,"" she said - to hand out free for dinner.
""People helped us greatly,"" said her neighbor, Angela Moreno Galves, 81. ""So now, of course, we want to help too.""
Setting out from Honduras on Oct. 13, the caravan quickly swelled to number several thousand people. The latest estimates put its size at 3,500 to more than double that - matching or exceeding Niltepec's population of 3,800.
The warmth of the welcome in Niltepec stood in deliberate, stark contrast to Trump's hostility, said Jorge Luis Fuentes, a senior town official. 

""It's a form of struggle,"" he said. ""It's a way to demonstrate that rights are universal.""

270,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 06:41PM ET</span>",Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger killed in prison,"By Bill Trott and Sarah N. Lynch
(Reuters) - James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who lived a double life as one of Boston's most notorious mobsters and as a secret FBI informant before going on the run for 16 years, was killed at a federal prison in West Virginia, sources said on Tuesday. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into Bulger's death and a prison employee briefed on the matter said it was being investigated as a homicide. A U.S. Bureau of Prisons statement had earlier confirmed Bulger had died and said the FBI was investigating. 
Bulger, who was 89, had been transferred a day earlier to the high-security prison in a wheelchair, the prison employee said.
Two men were seen on surveillance footage entering his cell, the prison employee said.
Bulger's body was discovered wrapped in a sheet, the employee said, and the notorious gangster had been beaten so badly that blood had come out of his ears. 
Federal officials did not give a cause of death, but the Bureau of Prisons said no other inmates or staff were injured.
The prisons bureau had said in its statement that Bulger's body was found on Tuesday. The prison employee said it was discovered when he did not appear for breakfast, indicating he was killed early morning or overnight.
Henry Brennan, a defense lawyer for Bulger, said in an email he could not confirm or deny the reports.
Bulger was convicted in August 2013 of 11 murders, among other charges and sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years.
Prison had been something Bulger had gone to great lengths to avoid - killing potential witnesses, cultivating corrupt lawmen and living as a fugitive for 16 years. It all ended when a tip from a former Icelandic beauty queen led to his capture in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he was living with a long-time girlfriend.
Bulger and his Winter Hill gang had operated for more than two decades in the insular Irish-dominated South Boston neighborhood, engaging in loan sharking, gambling, extortion, drug dealing and murder. They did so with the tacit approval of an FBI agent who looked the other way when it came to Bulger's crimes so that he would supply information on other gangsters.
Bulger, portrayed by Johnny Depp in the 2015 film ""Black Mass,"" was feared for his short temper and brutality. Prosecutors said he strangled two women with his hands and tortured a man for hours before shooting him in the head with a machine gun.
""We took what we wanted,"" Kevin Weeks, a former Bulger lieutenant who would eventually testify against him, wrote in ""Brutal,"" his memoir. ""We made millions through extortion and loansharking and protection. And if someone ratted us out, we killed him. We were not nice guys.""
Bulger was born Sept. 3, 1929, and grew up in South Boston. He was called ""Whitey"" because of his light blond hair but was said to detest the nickname and preferred being called Jimmy. As a teenager he joined a gang known as The Shamrocks, compiled an arrest record for assault and armed robbery and ended up in a juvenile reformatory.
Bulger was a bank robber early in his criminal career, which landed him in prisons such as the infamous Alcatraz, located on an island in San Francisco Bay.
Upon his release in 1965, he eventually fell in with the Irish mob in South Boston and worked his way through the ranks as a bookie and loanshark. He survived a gang war between two Irish mobs and was a leading figure in Boston's underworld by the early 1970s.
His career was boosted by his relationship with rogue FBI agent John J. Connolly, who Bulger had known since they were boys. Connolly was supposed to be in charge of getting information out of him and Bulger did provide information that helped the FBI go after his main rival, New England's Italian Mafia, as well as local criminals.
In return, Connolly let Bulger know about working investigations while Bulger and close associate Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi carried on with impunity. After he retired from the FBI, Connolly tipped off Bulger about a coming indictment, sending the mobster on the run in 1995.
Connolly was convicted in 2008 of racketeering, taking bribes and second-degree murder for his role in the slaying of an accountant who Bulger and Flemmi feared would testify against them.
""A BAD, BAD, BAD GUY""
Bulger's former associates turned on him while he was at large and their information led to a 2000 indictment that originally charged him with 19 murders.
""The guy is a sociopathic killer,"" Tom Foley, who worked on Bulger cases for the Massachusetts State Police, told CNN. ""He loved that type of life. He's one of the hardest and cruelest individuals that operated in the Boston area. He's a bad, bad, bad guy.""
When Bulger fled, he first took Teresa Stanley, his girlfriend of 30 years, with him. After a few weeks at large, however, Stanley wanted to go home so Bulger dropped her off in the Boston area. He picked up another of his girlfriends, Catherine Greig, and disappeared again.
Bulger spent his final years of freedom in No. 303 of the Princess Eugenia apartment complex in Santa Monica with Greig.
One of their neighbors, Anna Bjornsdottir, a former U.S. television actress and Miss Iceland of 1974, earned a $2 million reward for turning in Bulger. She was watching a television news report about the Bulger manhunt when she recognized the man she knew by the name Charlie Gasko and notified the FBI.
At first he denied his identity but eventually told authorities, ""You know who I am. I'm Whitey Bulger."" More than $800,000 in cash and a cache of weapons was found hidden in the walls of his apartment.
Greig was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $150,000 for helping Bulger evade capture. She is scheduled for release in September 2020.
Bulger's two-month trial for murder, extortion and drug dealing in 2013 was sometimes raucous. A parade of former associates testified against him, giving brutal details about how Bulger would kill enemies and then take a nap.
Sometimes Bulger sat silently at the defendant's table and at other times he engaged in profane shouting matches with witnesses such as Flemmi.
Bulger, who denied ever being an FBI informant, refused to testify on the grounds that the trial was a sham.
The U.S. Justice Department paid more than $20 million in damages to families of people killed by Bulger on the grounds that he was operating under government supervision while killing.
While Bulger was robbing banks and killing people, his younger brother Billy was acquiring political notoriety and power.

Billy served in the Massachusetts legislature for 35 years, including several years as president of the state Senate, after which he was president of the University of Massachusetts. He was forced to resign the latter job in 2003 after it was learned that eight years earlier he had spoken by phone with his brother, who at the time was a federal fugitive, and did not report it to authorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Venezuela poses a clear threat to regional stability and its economic collapse could drag down key U.S. allies in Latin America such as Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, a senior Treasury Department official warned on Tuesday.
Marshall Billingslea, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the Treasury Department, also accused the government of President Nicolas Maduro of contaminating Venezuelan water supplies at gold mining sites. 
""Venezuela poses a clear threat to regional stability and security on top of the horrific humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our very eyes,"" Billingslea told the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
""This is a hemispheric issue and the implosion of the regime there is a direct challenge for us,"" he added.
Oil rich Venezuela's economy has sunk into crisis under Maduro forcing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into neighboring countries amid hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and power cuts.
Billingslea said Maduro's government was ""one of the largest criminal enterprises in the Western Hemisphere"" involved in money laundering, graft, fraud and illegal mining schemes, including mining gold and sending it to Turkey for processing.
""It is being done not just illegally, but it is being done at enormous environmental expense,"" he said, ""The regime has basically awarded itself control over a huge percentage of the country and is now stripping this gold out and dumping massive amounts of chemical and mercury contaminants into water supplies.""
""We have highlighted the fact that a lot of this non-monetary gold appears to be destined for Turkey,"" he added.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Billingslea's remarks.
The Trump administration has sought to pressure Maduro, his relatives, and senior members of the Socialist Party through sanctions but the government has shown no willingness to hand over power or negotiate a transition.
Billingslea said the United States was collaborating with countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Argentina and Spain to block assets stolen from Venezuela.
""We are on the hunt for Maduro and (his wife) Cilia Flores' money and we are not going to stop until we find it,"" Billingslea said, adding: ""It's not their money, it's money they stole.""

The U.S. State Department confirmed on Tuesday that an American citizen had been killed in Cameroon and said it was offering all appropriate consular assistance to the family, but provided no further details about the person.
Charles Wesco, a 44-year-old Baptist missionary, had been in Cameroon for less than two weeks when he was killed, his sister-in-law, Joy Williams (NYSE:WMB), said.
He was shot in a region of northwest Cameroon where the military has been fighting English-speaking separatists who want to break away from the predominantly Francophone central government and create an independent state called Ambazonia.
The conflict has killed hundreds of people since last year and has emerged as Cameroon President Paul Biya's greatest security problem in nearly four decades in power.
Biya won election to a seventh term earlier this month. 
The American missionary was traveling in a vehicle with his wife, one of his children and another missionary, heading toward the town of Bamenda, when a soldier shot him several times in the head, Williams said by phone from the United States. 
Aside from Wesco, no one else in the vehicle was struck by gunfire during the ambush, Williams said, and the family was unsure if the soldier was with the country's military or the separatists.
Wesco, who lived in Warsaw, Indiana, and belonged to a local Baptist church there, had been a piano tuner before becoming a missionary, Williams said. He is survived by eight children, she said.
The Wesco family had originally planned to move to Cameroon in August but had delayed their mission because of the unrest, she said. ""They were aware of the danger,"" she said.

LIMA (Reuters) - At least 6,000 Venezuelans lined up at Peru's northern border on Tuesday in hopes of entering the country before a deadline for acquiring residency, and another 4,000 were due to arrive in the next two days, Peru's ombudsman's office said.
Peru was one of the first countries to offer temporary residency cards for Venezuelans who have been fleeing their crisis-stricken homeland and crossing Colombia and Ecuador to reach Peru.
As the number of Venezuelans in Peru has surged to nearly half a million, the government moved the deadline from the end of the year to the end of October. They must enter the country by Wednesday to be eligible for the cards which allow them to live, work and study in the country legally.
Peru also started requiring passports for entry.
As the deadline has neared, a growing number of Venezuelans have crowded at Peru's border with Ecuador, said Abel Chiroque, the head of the ombudsman's office in the border town of Tumbes.
""Demand for services is overwhelming ... the capacity to respond has collapsed,"" Chiroque said by phone, describing migrants who have been in line for nearly 24 hours. ""The situation is worrisome.""
Chiroque said he asked the government to distribute tickets to Venezuelans in line when the deadline closes, so they can be eligible for the residency cards later.
Peru's immigration agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As oil-rich Venezuela's economy has sunk into crisis under President Nicolas Maduro, as many as 1.9 million Venezuelans have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations. Some 90 percent of recent departures, the U.N. says, remain in South America.
The exodus has stressed social services and sparked concerns about crime and jobs in host countries, and many migrants are facing restrictive immigration laws and discrimination.
Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said Monday that Peru could not give residency to Venezuelans indefinitely.

A Norwegian citizen of Iranian background was arrested in Sweden on Oct. 21 in connection with the plot and extradited to Denmark, Swedish security police said. 
The Norwegian has denied the charges and Tehran also rejected the allegations on Tuesday.
The attack was meant to target the leader of the Danish branch of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), Danish intelligence chief Finn Borch Andersen said.
ASMLA seeks a separate state for ethnic Arabs in Iran's oil-producing southwestern province of Khuzestan.
""We are dealing with an Iranian intelligence agency planning an attack on Danish soil. Obviously, we can't and won't accept that,"" Andersen told a news conference. 
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi dismissed the accusations. ""This is a continuation of enemies' plots to damage Iranian relations with Europe at this critical time,"" Tasnim news agency quoted him as saying.
European countries are trying to save a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact and announced the reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.
Andersen said the arrested Norwegian citizen had denied charges in court of helping a foreign intelligence service plot an assassination in Denmark. 
Arabs are a minority in Iran, and some see themselves as under Persian occupation and want independence or autonomy.
Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Twitter that the reported attack plot was ""completely unacceptable"". 
""The government will respond to Iran and is speaking with European partners on further measures,"" Samuelsen said.
On Sept. 28, Danish police shut two major bridges to traffic and halted ferry services from Denmark to Sweden and Germany in a nationwide police operation to prevent a possible attack.
A few days earlier, the Norwegian suspect had been observed photographing and watching the Danish home of the ASMLA leader, police said. 
In November 2017, Ahmad Mola Nissi, an Iranian exile who established ASMLA, was shot dead in the Netherlands. The Danish security service then bolstered police protection of the ASMLA leader in Denmark and two associates. 
Last month, Iran summoned the envoys of the Netherlands, Denmark and Britain over a Sept. 22 shooting attack on a military parade in Khuzestan in which 25 people were killed. 
Iran accused the three countries of harboring Iranian opposition groups.
Another Arab opposition group, the Ahwaz National Resistance, and the Islamic State militant group both claimed responsibility for the parade attack, though neither has provided conclusive evidence to back up their claim.

Last week, diplomatic and security sources said France had expelled an Iranian diplomat over a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack on a rally in the Paris area by an exiled Iranian opposition group.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's decision to cancel a multi-billion dollar Mexico City airport has pitched him into conflict with business elites, auguring a rocky start to his plans to revive the economy.
The partly-built $13 billion airport on the eastern flank of Mexico City was the biggest public works project of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto, intended to relieve pressure on the current hub and serve the metropolis for decades to come.
But during the campaign that catapulted him to a landslide victory in July, the left-leaning Lopez Obrador attacked the new airport as a nexus of corruption between business interests and the political class as he vowed to end graft in Mexico.
Business leaders bristled at his decision on Monday, made on the basis of a divisive four-day referendum organized by Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party.
Juan Pablo Castanon, head of Mexico's CCE business lobby, said the cancellation cast doubt on the continuity of projects across administrations, and put the economy at risk.
""This seriously affects the prestige of Mexico in the eyes of the world and its ability to attract investment,"" he said.
The decision sparked fears of protracted legal disputes and concern that steps to liberalize Latin America's second-largest economy could be reversed. Mexican markets reeled.
""It's a test of strength against Mexican businessmen,"" said Raul Benitez, a political scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
The American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico, which groups some of the largest investors in the economy, said in a statement it was ""highly concerned"" by the ""polarizing"" move.
Announcing the cancellation at a news conference, Lopez Obrador dismissed his critics, saying they would have to get used to a new reality, and questioned whether Mexico should be ""subordinated to financial markets.""
""A message has gone out that there's a clear divide: a division between economic and political power,"" he said. ""Who's in charge? Is it not the people? Is it not the citizens? Is that not democracy? This is the change.""
The 64-year-old Lopez Obrador also attacked Pena Nieto's decision to open up the oil and gas industry to private capital, reviving fears that he could also walk back that reform.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, has said the energy opening could also be put to a vote. His priority is to revive state oil company Pemex and reverse declining oil output.
Mexico's peso currency and stocks suffered their biggest falls since Donald Trump's election as U.S. president two years ago after a campaign laced with hostile rhetoric towards Mexico.
Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to boost annual economic growth to 4.0 percent from just over 2.0 at present, said markets would settle down. Companies could participate in his alternative plan to build a cheaper airport north of the capital, he said.
The referendum was widely criticized. Some Mexican journalists reported being able to vote several times.
Barely a million people took part in the poll on the airport, which has been under construction since 2015. Around 750,000 voted against it, less than 1 percent of the electorate.
Before the vote, opinion polls suggested the public favored allowing the completion of the new airport, whose futuristic terminal building was co-designed by British architect Norman Foster and the son-in-law of business tycoon Carlos Slim.
Slim's family is also co-building and co-financing the hub. He has yet to comment publicly on the decision. A spokesman for Slim did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Gustavo de Hoyos, president of Mexican employers' confederation Coparmex, told Reuters he would explore legal options to prevent the airport from being suspended.

Monday's decision, he added, sent out ""a very negative signal before (Lopez Obrador's) administration has even begun.""

The International Atomic Energy Agency posted pictures online of Amano chairing a meeting with staff and being presented with flowers at its headquarters in Vienna. A spokesman confirmed he was back at the headquarters.
The agency, which among other things is in charge of policing the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities under Tehran's 2015 deal with major powers, said in early September that Amano had undergone a medical procedure outside Austria that was successful.
The agency said at the time that Amano, a 71-year-old Japanese diplomat who was reappointed last year to a third four-year term, was expected to return to Vienna in early October.
Although the IAEA said Amano continued to oversee the agency's work, he was away during one of its busiest times of the year, including last month's General Conference, an annual gathering of its member states.

He addressed the General Conference in a brief video message in which he appeared thin and weakened.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday turned down a last-ditch effort by accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman to delay his trial, scheduled to begin next Monday with jury selection in Brooklyn federal court.
Lawyers for Guzman said in a motion last week that they needed more time to review more than 14,000 pages documents, largely related to key witnesses expected to testify against their client, that prosecutors turned over on Oct. 5. 
However, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said at a hearing on Tuesday that the volume of documents was in line with what they should have expected, noting that prosecutors had said in July that it could be 25,000 pages and that sprawling, complex cases like Guzman's were necessarily challenging for both sides.
""Nobody is going to be as ready to try this case as they would like to be,"" he said.
In what he called a small concession to the defense, Cogan ruled that opening statements in the trial would begin no earlier than Nov. 13, which could allow some extra time to prepare if jury selection finishes early next week.
Cogan also raised concerns at the hearing about the prosecutors' planned case at the hearing. He said he was concerned that the prosecutors had indicated that they were prepared to present evidence that Guzman was involved in more than 30 murder conspiracies, even though the charges against him are for drug trafficking.
""This is a drug case,"" he said. ""I'm not in any way going to let them try a murder conspiracy case that happens to involve drugs.""
He said that while some evidence of murder conspiracies connected to alleged drug trafficking would be allowed, it would be limited.

Guzman, 61, has been in solitary confinement since being extradited to the United States from Mexico in January 2017. He was known internationally as the head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.

Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni Muslim politician, is trying to clinch a deal on a national unity government more than five months since a general election that produced a parliament tilted in favor of Hezbollah and its allies.
A major hurdle was cleared on Monday when a row over Christian representation was settled with the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces ceding ground to President Michel Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, a Hezbollah ally.
The row over Sunni representation is the last problem. 
Hezbollah is insisting one of its Sunni allies be made a minister to reflect the result of an election in which Hariri lost more than a third of his seats, many of them to Sunni allies of Hezbollah.
""Our view is that their demand is just and we stand by them,"" senior Hezbollah official Hussein Khalil said in televised comments after meeting with the group's Sunni allies.
""I believe the problem of the representation of the independent Sunni MPs is not bigger than the problems that were solved,"" he said.
Hariri has ruled out giving up one of his cabinet seats. A possible compromise would be for Aoun to appoint one of the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis within a group of ministers named by the head of state.
Lebanon is dire need of a government that can embark on economic reforms that are seen as more pressing than ever. The country is wrestling with the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy and stagnant growth.
Government posts in Lebanon are filled according to a strict sectarian system. The president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim. Posts in the cabinet of 30 ministers must be split equally between Christians and Muslims.
Faisal Karami, one the Hezbollah-allied Sunni MPs, criticized Hariri and his Future Movement party.
""He wants to monopolize the entire Sunni sect for himself,"" Karami told LBC television. ""Today the Future Movement no longer represents the absolute, overwhelming majority in the Sunni street."" 
Rashed Fayed, a Future Movement official, said the demand by Hezbollah and its allies was ""sudden"" and ""contrived"" after months when the subject had not surfaced in the cabinet discussions. ""Saad al-Hariri will not let it pass,"" he told Reuters.
A second source in the Hariri camp described the row as quite serious and said resolving it ""will take time"".
Together, Hezbollah and its political allies secured more than 70 of the 128 seats in parliament in the election, Lebanon's first in nine years.
Hezbollah, proscribed as a terrorist movement by the United States, is expected to take control of the health ministry, the most significant cabinet post it has held, and to increase its number of ministers to three from two in the outgoing cabinet.

Almost 700 come daily to his house which he converted into a school in the government-held city of Taiz, which has been at the center of a three-and-a-half-year civil war that has left millions on the brink of famine.
Both the Iranian-aligned armed Houthi movement and Yemen's internationally recognized government have deployed forces in various districts of the southwestern city, Yemen's third largest.
Al-Shorbagy opened the school following the outbreak of war saying he had nowhere to send his own children. However, 500 boys and girls aged between six and 15 signed up for lessons in that first year.
""All the schools closed down and we had a problem that our kids were on the street,"" Al-Shorbagy told Reuters. 
""We opened this building as a community initiative. It was my national and humanitarian duty towards my neighborhood.""
Inside the house, facilities are basic, with exposed brick walls and big gaps where windows should be. Ripped curtains are used to divide up space for classrooms.
Undeterred, the eager children find any space they can on the floor, with barely any room to move, let alone write. They share donated books and follow what one of the 16 volunteer teachers writes on a broken white board.
Classes include math, science and English, with Al-Shorbagy saying he follows the pre-war Yemeni curriculum.
Despite the ramshackle setting and lack of facilities, the school is oversubscribed in a country where education has been decimated and accessible, free school options are limited.
Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government, a UNICEF report said in March.
Two million children are out of school in Yemen, including Shehab Mohamed Hazzaa, whose mother was trying to enroll him at Al-Shorbagy's school.
""I came here to register... in the school and the principal told me that it is too crowded and rejected him,"" said the mother, who declined to be named.
The only other option in the city are private schools but they cost up to 100,000 Yemeni riyal ($400) per year, putting them out of reach for many in the impoverished Arab country.

Machar's office said he would hold joint peace celebrations with his long-time rival, President Salva Kiir, in Juba - though there was no immediate confirmation from the government
The world's youngest nation plunged into civil war in late 2013 when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with forces loyal to Machar, the former vice president.
Ethnically charged fighting soon spread from the capital across the impoverished state, shutting down oil fields, forcing millions to flee and killing tens of thousands of people.
“Machar will lead a delegation of the SPLM/A-IO members for the peace celebration in Juba but the program in Juba is entirely in the hands of the regime,"" group spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said.
Under pressure from the United Nations, the United States and other Western donors, Machar and other insurgent factions signed a peace deal with the government in August after a string of failed talks and accords. 
Machar fled to neighboring Democratic republic of Congo in 2016 months after an earlier peace deal collapsed. He later traveled to South Africa where he was held under house arrest until peace talks started again in June, sponsored by regional bloc Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

CASABLANCA, Morocco (Reuters) - After two sleepless days and nights begging on the streets of Casablanca, Guinea teenager Ismail could finally afford to rebuild his home in a temporary camp opposite the city's main bus terminal.
The 18-year-old was among the 1,000 migrants whose tents and belongings were destroyed by a fire late on Saturday, the third at the camp since July 2017. It is unclear how the fire started.
On Monday, Ismail and his camp neighbors began clearing debris, sawing and nailing wooden frames as they began to rebuild the area which last week housed 300 plastic tents.
""I spent Saturday and Sunday night in the street unable to sleep after the fire,"" said Ismail, who declined to give his full name because he did not want his family to find out about his suffering.
Ismail was one of some 6,000 Africans that were moved by the Moroccan government from the northern city of Tangier and a nearby forest to the country's south in an attempt to stop them crossing over to Spain.
Officials described the moves as a crackdown on illegal trafficking networks. Rights groups have called it forced displacement.
Morocco to Spain has become the gateway to Europe for many African migrants after Italy closed its doors to most asylum-seekers who were entering via Libya.
Ismail, though, had begun heading north again. He lives in Casablanca, a central coastal city and major transport hub, but he wants to keep going north.
""I am planning to stay in Casablanca until I get enough money to go to the north where I can attempt another crossing of the fence of one of the Spanish cities,"" he said referring to Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves.
More than 6,000 migrants have made it to Melilla and Spain’s nearby territory Ceuta so far this year, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
Others pay smugglers to get them across the 14 km (9 miles) of sea to Spain.
But until the funds are raised, a temporary home in Casablanca needs to be rebuilt.
James is 26 and arrived in Morocco from Sierra Leone nine months ago after crossing from Algeria. Holding a hammer and nails which he bad bought, he was waiting for one of ""the big brothers"" to tell him where to build a tent.
The ""big brothers"" are camp elders representing the different sub-Saharan communities in the camp.

""In fall and winter we need more plastic for the tent's roof and more blankets to feel warm. I hope I will find some before it gets colder,"" he said, looking at the foggy sky.

The bombing on Habib Bourguiba avenue was the first such violence in the capital since late 2015 when militants killed dozens of people in attacks that targeted the country's vital tourism sector.
""We will stay here and will continue to live normally ... we will shake them off (extremists),"" said Lamia Ben Omar, who was sitting with a friend in a cafe. Police cars increased patrols and officers searched some pedestrians, witnesses said.

OLDENBURG, Germany (Reuters) - A German nurse admitted in court on Tuesday to being post-war Germany's deadliest serial killer, murdering 99 patients with lethal injections so that he could play the hero by trying to revive them.
When judge Sebastian Buehrmann asked 41-year-old Niels Hoegel if the charges against him were valid, he responded in the affirmative, adding: ""All that I have admitted to is true.""
Hoegel hid his face behind a blue plastic folder as he was ushered into the courtroom in the northern city of Oldenburg by police and his attorney.
He had already been sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2015 after he was found guilty of killing two patients with lethal injections. In January, prosecutors brought new charges against him for killing another 97 people.
His admission will not end the trial, at which families of the victims hope to uncover more information about the crimes.
""We want him to get the sentence that he deserves,"" said Frank Brinkers, whose father died in an overdose allegedly administered by Hoegel. ""When this trial is over we want to put this whole thing behind us and find closure.""
Prosecutors in the northern German city of Oldenburg say an investigation and toxicology reports showed that he injected 35 people at one clinic, in Oldenburg, and 62 at another in nearby Delmenhorst, with drugs that could kill them.
Ten years ago, a German nurse was convicted of killing 28 elderly patients. He said he gave them lethal injections because he felt sorry for them. He was sentenced to life in prison.

In Britain, Dr Harold Shipman was believed to have killed as many as 250 people, most of them elderly and middle-aged women who were his patients. Known as Dr Death, Shipman was sentenced to 15 life terms in 2000; he died prison in 2004, apparently a suicide.

MALE (Reuters) - The Maldives' Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed exiled former president Mohamed Nasheed's 13-year jail sentence on terrorism charges, allowing him to go home this week.
Nasheed has said he will return on Thursday.
The move comes days before newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih is scheduled to take his oath of office. Solih, a close ally of Nasheed, unseated former pro-China leader Abdulla Yameen in the Sept. 23 poll by a 16.8 percent margin. 
Nasheed was sentenced to jail for ordering the abduction of a judge after a rushed and widely criticized trial in March 2015. He went into exile during a medical trip to Britain. 
The Muslim-majority tourist paradise has been in political upheaval since February, when a state of emergency was imposed by Yameen to annul a court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including Nasheed.
The Maldives, located near key shipping lanes, has become a battleground for China and India as they compete for influence in the region. 

The Supreme Court also reinstated 12 opposition lawmakers who were stripped of their seats when they defected to the opposition in 2017.

Washington reintroduced sanctions against Iran's currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after it pulled out from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran's nuclear program.
A new set of sanctions on Iranian banking and energy sectors are to take effect Nov. 5, as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to cut oil purchases from the Islamic Republic to zero.
""Unfortunately a law-breaking country (the United States) seeks to punish a country (Iran) that is abiding by law.... This method will have severe consequences for the world order,"" Zarif was quoted as saying by the Iranian state news agency IRNA during a visit to Istanbul.
However, Zarif added, ""Americans have not achieved their goals by imposing illegal sanctions against Iran"".
Tehran says it has complied fully with the nuclear accord and its commitment has been repeatedly confirmed by the U.N. atomic watchdog, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Trump complained that the deal, approved by his predecessor Barack Obama, does not cover Iran's ballistic missiles, its role in regional wars or what happens after the nuclear pact begins to expire in 2025.
""The world community has stood up to the U.S. sanctions,"" Zarif said, after a trilateral meeting between Iran, Turkey and Azerbaijan's foreign minister.
""The neighboring countries and Europeans nations have resisted against Washington's unilateral measures.""
European signatories of the nuclear deal are still committed to the accord and will soon launch a mechanism, a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV), aiming to sidestep the U.S. financial system by using an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish lawyer looking into the death of Jamal Khashoggi has asked Saudi Arabia's prosecutor to disclose who sent the team involved in the journalist's killing, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.
Saudi prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb held talks with Istanbul's prosecutor on Monday and Tuesday about Khashoggi's death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which has escalated into a crisis for the world's top oil exporter.
Riyadh at first denied any knowledge of, or role in, his disappearance four weeks ago but Mojeb has contradicted those statements, saying the killing of Khashoggi, a critic of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was premeditated.
The case has put into focus the West's close relationship with Saudi Arabia - a major arms buyer and lynchpin of Washington's regional plans to contain Iran - given the widespread scepticism over its initial response.
Turkey has kept up the pressure on the Saudis, demanding a full explanation and releasing a steady flow of evidence which undermined Riyadh's early denials. 
Saudi Arabia says that 18 suspects in the case will face justice in the kingdom, despite repeated calls from Ankara for them to be extradited for trial in Turkey.
""Yesterday, our prosecutor told the Saudi prosecutor that the prosecution could be carried out in Turkey since the location of the crime is Istanbul,"" Erdogan told reporters at Turkey's parliament. 
Saudi officials also needed to disclose who had sent a 15-strong team to Istanbul to carry out the operation targeting Khashoggi, as well as the identity of a local agent said to have helped dispose of his body.
""Our prosecutor asked who sent the group that came here and said that this needed to be looked at,"" Erdogan said. ""Saudi officials need to reveal the local cooperators. Let us know whoever this person is and we will find them. 
""We cannot leave this issue unsolved, we need to solve it now. There is no point in procrastinating or trying to save some people from under this.""
Saudi prosecutor Mojeb held talks with Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, at Istanbul's main court house for a second time on Tuesday before heading for the consulate where Khashoggi was killed, Turkish broadcaster NTV reported.
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called on Riyadh to conclude the investigation as soon as possible.

""The whole truth must be revealed,"" he said. ""We believe (Mujeb's) visit is important for these truths to come out.""

295,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 08:22AM ET</span>","Less meat, more pasta: how the economic crisis is changing Argentina's diet","By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Like most Argentines, Sabrina Pozo used to eat meat several times a week. But soaring inflation and the collapse of Argentina's currency, the peso, since April have forced her to abruptly change her diet.
""My habits changed a lot. Before, maybe I made beef Milanese (breaded cutlet) once a week and roast beef once a week,"" Pozo, 36, said.
""Now, maybe I won't make roast beef or I choose to make chicken, which is a little cheaper,"" said Pozo, a flight attendant who lives with her daughter in an apartment in Buenos Aires. ""More pasta, more rice.""
Beef is making a rarer appearance at the dinner tables of middle-class families as the country spirals deeper into economic turmoil, a Reuters review of meat industry data and interviews with consumers, butchers and ranchers has found. It's one of the clearest signs of how far Argentines have seen their purchasing power slashed by inflation, which is expected to surpass 44 percent by year's end, according to the latest central bank poll.
Argentines interviewed said they cannot afford to eat as much beef as they used to and now regularly swap it with less expensive foods. Butchers told Reuters they had seen sharp falls in beef sales in recent months. Ranchers and meat packers, who depend on domestic consumers for most of their sales, said they were being kept afloat by growing exports to Russia and China, the main foreign buyers of Argentine beef.
None of this is easy for Argentines to swallow. Most see eating beef as a part of their cultural identity.
""The people are carnivores. Argentines always, for their whole lives, have eaten meat,"" said Javier Madeo, 45, who owns a butcher shop in Buenos Aires.
While Argentines have been slowly reducing their meat consumption over the past 60 years, they have remained among the most carnivorous people in the world. But in September a little-reported statistic published by the country's beef industry chamber, Ciccra, revealed a new reality: Meat consumption fell to an annual average of 49 kg (108 lb) per person that month.
That was down nearly 17 percent over the previous month. A major month on month drop. But much more significantly it was one of the lowest levels of consumption recorded in 60 years, according to a Reuters review of data compiled by the country's main body for promoting Argentine beef, which goes by the Spanish acronym IPCVA.
There were two other months during the period reviewed when meat consumption plunged to about that level - in February 2017 and March 2008 - but those falls were due to shorter months, holidays and a dispute between the government and the agriculture sector.
This is all potentially bad news for President Mauricio Macri, who is deeply unpopular and faces an uphill battle in his bid for re-election in October 2019. His steep cuts to electricity, water and cooking gas subsidies are aimed at breaking his country's boom and bust economic cycle, but they have made life much more expensive for Argentines. He risks losing support among the middle class voters who helped him win the presidency in 2015.
The impact of Argentina's economic crisis reaches far beyond the dinner table. As inflation soars, people arrange trades for everyday items like clothing and food that they otherwise could no longer afford in a resurgence of Buenos Aires' traditional barter clubs, now organized through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Inside the home, the subsidy cuts have sharply increased household bills. Many people have scaled back on utilities, including gas for heating their homes through Argentina's winter months, and will likely do the same for air conditioning this summer. 
HUNGRY FOR MEAT
Last year, Argentines - together with their Uruguayan neighbors - led the world in meat consumption, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). From steaks to sausage, the country's famed high-quality beef dominates the menus of its cafes and grills, known as parrillas.
But in September alone, meat prices jumped nearly 9 percent from the previous month, and beef was 39 percent more expensive than it was the same month a year earlier, according to the IPCVA data.
Higher prices have curtailed a popular practice among Argentine construction workers, preparing an ""asado,"" or barbecue, at their work sites during Friday lunch hour. Once a common occurrence on city streets, it is now a rare sight.
""Before, people came and bought a kilo or a bit more. Now, they buy a half kilo,"" said Alcides Benitez, 41, a butcher. He worries he may have to close his shop in the historic San Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires.
Inflation in Argentina increased 6.5 percent in September alone. Adding to the pain, salaries have been slow to adjust.
Argentines have experienced soaring inflation in the past. During the country's devastating financial crisis in 2001/2002 economic hardship undercut meat consumption. But an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Argentina prompted a plunge in the country's beef exports, forcing meat producers to sell at home at lower prices. As a result, despite the crisis, Argentines were still largely able to sate their appetite for meat.
SERIOUS BLOW
The new drop in consumption is a serious blow for Argentina's meat industry, which was already reeling from the worst drought in years that scorched pastures in cattle-producing areas from late 2017 to mid-2018.
The meat industry relies on the domestic market for about 86 percent of sales, according to Ciccra. Strong demand from China and Russia has helped the beef industry offset losses in the domestic market, but exports, while growing, still account for only a small portion of overall sales.
Despite being famous for the quality of its meat, Argentina exports at a much lower rate than other major meat exporters like Brazil and Australia, said Matias Sara, a private consultant for the Argentine meat sector. For years, red tape and government policies that favored the domestic market have been an obstacle to export growth.
Macri, a free-market advocate, slashed export taxes upon taking office in an effort to boost economic activity in the previously closed economy. He has since reintroduced taxes on some exports as he tries to balance the country's budget.
""If it weren't for China, particularly, and the rest of exports, in general, there would be a collapse,"" said livestock producer Ulises Forte, who is also a director at IPCVA.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel hosts African leaders on Tuesday in a drive to tackle underdevelopment on the continent that helped to spur mass migration, shaping the later years of her long premiership.
Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by 2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to succeed her.
She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a stable destination for German investment.
The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the poverty which along with political instability and violence has encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
""We have to make sure we don't stay in aid mode,"" Merkel's Africa coordinator Guenter Nooke told public radio. ""The many millions of jobs we need in Africa can't be created with public money.""
If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to her fateful decision three years ago.
Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or her old rival, the strongly pro-business Friedrich Merz, are well to her right politically and could be expected to want to challenge much of her legacy.
Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of the human tide.
The crisis upturned European politics, revitalizing the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge into parliament in last year's election.
But officials around the chancellor believe that migration can only be slowed sustainably by removing the ""push"" factors of unemployment and instability in Africa, something that will only be exacerbated by climate change.
Officials hope that the summit, attended also by Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will encourage more companies to invest on the continent, creating jobs that aid has failed to do. 
A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats (SPD).

All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in regional elections this month, building internal party pressure for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - More than 10,000 protesting supporters of Sri Lanka's ousted prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, brought parts of the capital, Colombo, to a standstill on Tuesday as political turmoil on the island entered its fifth day.
Sri Lanka was plunged into crisis on Friday when President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and swore in ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa to replace him, breaking up a fragile coalition governing the country.
Sirisena also suspended parliament, to the fury of Wickremesinghe's supporters, who say the president is trying to prevent lawmakers from keeping him in power. 
On Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered near Wickremesinghe's residence to hear the ousted prime minister speak, holding signs demanding that Sirisena to preserve democracy.
""He has broken his promise and taken the executive powers into his hands,"" Wickremesinghe told the crowd, referring to Sirisena.
""He has sidelined parliamentary power.""
The crowd, which police estimated at more than 10,000, blocked several roads in the city-center neighborhood that includes embassies, high-end stores and hotels, according to a Reuters witness.
""This is a coup. It has all the characteristics of a coup,"" one of the protesters, Deepanjalie Abeywardene, told Reuters, while holding a sign which read ""reconvene the parliament"". 
""This is a third-grade act by Sirisena. We voted him as the president to ensure democracy,"" said P. Ariyadasa, a 62-year-old farmer from Mesawachchiya, 230 km from Colombo.
LEGAL WRANGLE
Sirisena maintains his sacking of Wickremesinghe without the approval of parliament was constitutional.
The government's new spokesman, Mahinda Samarasinghe, told a news conference that Sirisena had met foreign diplomats on Monday and told them the constitution allowed for the removal of Wickremesinghe.
Sirisena named a new cabinet on Monday with Rajapaksa in charge of finance.
Rajapaksa’s crushing of a 26-year insurgency by ethnic Tamil separatists in 2009 won him support among the island nation’s Sinhalese majority, and he has a strong following.
Some of Wickremesinghe's ousted ministers have refused to accept his sacking. 
On Sunday, former oil minister Arjuna Ranatunga attempted to enter his office, leading to violence that left two dead. 
The speaker of parliament, Karu Jayasuriya, has also refused to recognize Rajapaksa as the new prime minister, warning of ""bloodshed"" if the standoff moves to the streets.
The power struggle in Sri Lanka comes at a critical time for its economy, with credit rating agencies warning that turmoil could raise financing costs and lower foreign capital inflows as it attempts to refinance sizable government debts.

Sri Lanka is also a key state in a battle for influence in south Asia between traditional ally India and China. The Chinese government has been one of the few to congratulate the pro-Beijing Rajapaksa on becoming prime minister.

""We are looking forward to start the repatriation by mid-November,"" Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque told reporters in Dhaka after a meeting with Myanmar delegation led by senior foreign ministry official Myint Thu.
Myint Thu hailed what he called a ""very concrete result on the commencement of the repatriation"".
""We have put in place a number of measures to make sure that the returnees will have a secure environment for their return,"" he told reporters.
But rights groups and Rohingya community leaders say conditions back in the north of Myanmar's Rakhine State, where most of the refugees are from, are not ready for a repatriation. 
Leaders of the largely stateless Rohingya community have said they will not return without various demands being met, including the rights to Myanmar citizenship.
""We have some demands but the government of Myanmar didn't do anything to meet them. How can we go back?"" Mohib Ullah, a Rohingya leader now living in southeast Bangladesh, told Reuters.
""What about our citizenships, our rights and our demand to go back to our land ... our own houses?""
The two countries reached a deal in November last year to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not started.
Rohingya are still crossing the border into Bangladesh, with nearly 14,000 arriving this year, according to U.N. officials.
U.N. investigators issued a report in August accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country’s commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Myanmar has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
Min Aung Hlaing suggested in September that the Rohingya belonged in Bangladesh and said they must ""accept scrutiny"" under a 1982 Citizenship Law.
The law limits citizenship for those, like the Rohingya, who are not members of officially decreed ethnic groups.
Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters in an interview last month that under no circumstance would the refugees be allowed to remain permanently.
Hasina, who is facing a general election at the end of the year, also accused Myanmar of finding new excuses to delay the return.
Myanmar denies that and says it is ready to take back the refugees and has built transit centers to house them initially on their return.

Given the delays, Bangladesh has been preparing new homes on a remote island called Bhasan Char, which rights groups have said could be subject to flooding.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian president-elect Jair Bolsonaro has revisited his most contentious campaign promises, calling for looser gun laws, urging a high-profile anti-corruption judge to join his government and promising to cut government advertising for media that ""lie."" 
In interviews with TV stations and on social media, Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain, who won 55 percent of Sunday's vote and will be sworn in on Jan. 1, made clear he would not waste time in pushing through his conservative agenda.
Bolsonaro, who ran on a law-and-order platform, said he wants Sergio Moro, the judge who has overseen the sprawling ""Car Wash"" corruption trials and convicted former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of graft, to join his government as justice minister.
Barring that, he said he would nominate him to the Supreme Court. The next vacancy on the court is expected in 2020. 
Moro did not respond to requests for comment.
But Ascânio Seleme, editor in chief for the O Globo newspaper, wrote in a Tuesday blog post on the publication's website that Moro should not accept the offer to become justice minister. He has too much work to do on pending corruption trials, Seleme wrote. 
Seleme added it would also bolster accusations from the Workers Party (PT), whose candidate Fernando Haddad lost to Bolsonaro in Sunday's vote, that Moro has a vendetta against the PT and worked to keep it from power. 
The PT accuses Moro of finding da Silva, its founder, guilty of graft to block him from making a presidential run. 
The guilty verdict was upheld on appeal and Brazil's Supreme Court has rejected numerous requests to free the former president, universally known as Lula. 
The Globo newspaper, in a separate article citing unnamed sources close to the judge, reported on Tuesday that Moro was weighing Bolsonaro's offer, feeling that he could reassure citizens concerned the president-elect will not govern democratically.
MEDIA SHOWDOWN
Late on Monday, Bolsonaro said in an interview with Globo TV that he would cut government advertising funds that flow to any ""lying"" media outlets. 
During his campaign, the right-winger imitated U.S. President Donald Trump's strategy of aggressively confronting the media. In particular, he took aim at Globo TV and especially Brazil's biggest newspaper, the Folha de S.Paulo.
""I am totally in favor of freedom of the press,"" Bolsonaro told Globo TV. ""But if it's up to me, press that shamelessly lies will not have any government support.""
Bolsonaro was referring to the hundreds of millions of reais the Brazilian government spends in advertising each year in local media outlets, mainly for promotions of state-run firms. 
The UOL news portal, owned by the Grupo Folha, which also controls the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, used Brazil's freedom of information act as the basis for a 2015 article that showed Globo received 565 million reais in federal government spending in 2014. Folha got 14.6 million reais that year.
The federal government's secretariat for communication, which tracks the figures, did not immediately reply for a request on how much money the government has spent on media advertising since 2014. 
Neither Grupo Globo nor Grupo Folha replied to requests for comment.

The Admiral Kuznetsov has seen action in Russia's military campaign in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad with its planes carrying out air strikes against rebel forces.
It was being overhauled on one of the world's biggest floating docks in the icy waters of the Kola Bay near Murmansk close to where Russia's Northern Fleet is based and was due to go back into service in 2021.
Maria Kovtun, Murmansk's governor, said in a statement that a rescue operation had been launched and 71 people evacuated after the floating dock holding the ship had begun to sink.
The warship had been successfully extracted from the dock before it completely sank, she said.
Investigators, who said they had opened a criminal investigation into the incident that would look at whether safety rules had been violated, said one person was missing and four others were being treated for hypothermia after being plucked out of the water. 
Alexei Rakhmanov, head of Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation, told the TASS news agency that the ship's hull and deck had been damaged, although what he called the vessel's vitally important parts had not been harmed.
Yevgeny Gladyshev, a spokesman for the shipbuilding factory which operated the floating dock, told the RIA news agency that unspecified equipment had been damaged but that much of the deck had been spared because it had been removed during repairs.
The floating dock had been hit by a power outage which had caused its water tanks to fill up rapidly, prompting it to sink, the factory said. 

The Admiral Kuznetsov gained notoriety in Britain when then Secretary of Defence Michael Fallon dubbed it the ""ship of shame"" in 2017 when it passed through waters close to the English coast on its way back from the Mediterranean belching black smoke.

Abdul Khalik Farouk's arrest on October 21 was the latest in a campaign against journalists, rights activists and government critics that have drawn wide condemnation from international rights groups.
Days before Farouk's arrest, local media reported that draft copies of his book, ""Is Egypt Really a Poor Country?"", which includes criticism of the government's economic policies, were seized by authorities from a publisher.
Farouk said a court in southern Cairo on Monday ordered him and the owner of the print shop that published his book, released. They were released from a local police station after the hearing, he added.
Farouk described his arrest as part ""of a campaign against freedom of expression"" and said the confiscation of his book was an act of ""security intimidation"" which is illegal under Egyptian laws.
Two local newspapers had earlier reported Farouk's release.
Since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in 2014, Egypt has seen a crackdown on dissent that activists say is unprecedented in its modern history.
Sisi's supporters say he is working to keep Egypt stable after years of political and economic turmoil following a 2011 popular uprising.

In the run-up to the election, Bolsonaro had portrayed China, its largest trading partner, as a predator looking to dominate key sectors of its economy.
Bolsonaro's friendly leanings towards self-ruled, democratic Taiwan are likewise vexing to Beijing, which considers the island a breakaway province. Bolsonaro in February became the first Brazilian presidential candidate to visit Taiwan since Brazil recognized Beijing as the sole Chinese government under the ""one China"" policy in the 1970s.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that its representative office in Brazil had offered the Taiwan government's ""immediate"" congratulations to Bolsonaro.
It also noted his visit to Taiwan earlier this year, where it said he had gained ""further understanding"" about Taiwan's national situation and economic development, which would help with cooperation and exchanges going forward.
Brazil, like most countries, only has formal diplomatic ties with China, not Taiwan, which China says has no right to state-to-state relations.
Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 countries worldwide, many of them small, less developed nations in Latin America and the Pacific.
Widely read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said on Tuesday that it would take Bolsonaro ""some time to get familiar with foreign policy"". 
""If he continues to disregard the basic principle over Taiwan after taking office, it will apparently cost Brazil a great deal,"" it said.
""As many Latin American countries have walked away from Taiwan, the Chinese island won't bring any more benefits to Brazil, which Bolsonaro and his team must be aware of.""
China has been focusing its attention on taking away more of Taiwan's Latin American allies and has so far this year won over El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.

China on Monday congratulated Bolsonaro after the far-right lawmaker won the election in a dramatic swing away from the left in the world's fourth-largest democracy.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>","A century on from WW1, 100 years of work remains to clear munitions","By Claudia Wyatt
VILOSNES-HARAUMONT, France (Reuters) - As the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One draws near next month, bomb disposal experts are still digging up munitions sunk in the killing fields of eastern France -- and it could be another 100 years before they are done.
In Vilosnes-Haraumont, where the River Meuse snakes north and west from Verdun, the German army dumped thousands of artillery shells into the river's slowly shifting waters after the battle of Mort Homme in 1916.
Last week a pair of scuba divers plunged into the chilly waters to tie ropes around dozens of shells buried in the river bed, before a crane dragged and carefully lifted a string of the rusted ordnance onto the grassy bank.
In one day's work, more than five tonnes of unexploded shells were dredged from the river, an unusually large haul. 
In a normal year, the Metz Demining Centre says it collects between 45 and 50 tonnes of ordnance, and it estimates there are at least 250 to 300 tonnes still buried in the nearby rivers and rolling hills of eastern France.
For Guy Momper, the bomb clearance specialist overseeing the clear-up, it is a painstaking but essential task to protect people from ammunition that could still explode and return the French landscape to the way it was before the war.
""We need to tidy up the land,"" said Momper, who estimates it could take more than a century to clear all the munitions. ""As a matter of principle, from the moment a shell is reported, we go out and collect it.""
ACCIDENTS
World War One was largely fought on French and Belgian soil. The bulk of the grinding conflict took place in trenches -- sometimes only a few meters apart -- dug into the soil along the borders of France, Germany and Belgium.
More than 10 million soldiers, including 1.4 million French, died in the conflict, which came to an end on Nov. 11, 1918, dramatically altering France's demography and landscape.
The physical impact can still be seen, with the traces of old trench networks scarring the fields, and the ground pockmarked by the blast holes from exploded shells.
While the munitions pulled from the River Meuse have little risk of exploding, Momper and his team want to make sure there are no accidents. Alongside the river, they stack dozens of shells in neat rows, ready to be packed and removed.

""There are regularly accidents involving people who fancy themselves as deminers but who go too far,"" said Benoit, a deminer working with the Metz team. ""Unfortunately that costs lives in the worst cases.""

MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (Reuters) - Hundreds of Druze Arabs, some carrying Syrian flags, gathered outside the gates of a polling station on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Tuesday, trying to block their townspeople from voting in municipal elections.
Israeli police wearing helmets and carrying tear gas launchers cleared a path for would-be voters (PICTURED) outside the balloting center in Majdal Shams.
The town is the largest Druze community in the area of mountainous plateau that Israel captured from Syria in a 1967 war, unilaterally annexing it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally.
""The Golan’s identity is Arab and Syrian,"" chanted the protesters as they put a banner on the entrance reading: ""No to elections.""
Inside the building election officials sat in mostly empty rooms with blue ballot boxes bearing Israeli insignia.
Some voters made it past the protest.
""It’s my right to vote. I’m free to choose the right person,"" said one man as he emerged from the polling station carrying a child. Glancing at the crowd, he refused to give his name.
The Druze are a fiercely independent Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam. Around 22,000 Druze live on the Israeli-occupied Golan.
Israel, seeking to further integrate them, has offered citizenship but most Druze rejected it. Many regard themselves as Syrian, even after more than half a century of life under Israeli rule.
After an election eve town center meeting and march featuring dozens of rainbow Druze flags, the community’s elders issued a prohibition against candidates standing and people voting, threatening to make outcasts of anyone who took part.
""Candidates and those who come to vote will have a religious and social prohibition put upon them,"" said Sheikh Khamis Khanjar. ""What bigger punishment is there than this?""
Many Druze have enjoyed economic prosperity on the other side of the front line from their brethren in war-torn Syria.
""When you are in a state that is giving you all your rights, why wouldn't you vote,"" said Sahar Said Ahmed as she watched the election eve protest in a town square dominated by the statue of a Druze leader who fought French forces during the colonial era.
Outside the polling station Druze religious elders wearing their distinctive maroon and white caps urged youths not to confront the police. One concern was that the issue of taking part in Israeli elections was dividing the community.
""For more than 50 years Israel has been trying to sow disputes by divide and rule and it is happy at the differences that are surfacing,"" said Moenis Abdullah.

The military government has imposed a strict ban on all political activity since a 2014 military coup, citing the need for peace and order after months of street protests against a civilian government of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Opponents of military rule say the ban, backed up by legal action against those who violate it, has stifled dissent.
Last month, the government relaxed some restrictions, allowing political parties to resume organizing ahead of a general election due by May next year but still maintain a ban on public gathering of more than five people and political campaigning.
""On the lifting of the ban on political activities, we will consider it sometime at the end of November or early December depending on suitability,"" Prayut told reporters after a meeting of his cabinet was held in the northern town of Chiang Rai.
The ban forbids all political activity including the holding of gatherings and campaigning.
The junta has said the ban on political activity has been necessary to preserve stability after more than a decade of at times violent rivalry between supporters of ousted premiers Thaksin Shinawatra, and his sister, Yingluck, and the Bangkok-based royalist establishment.
Political parties are gearing up for next year's general election, being held under a military-drafted constitution that critics say will prolong military influence over civilian politics.
Last month, Prayut said he was interested in having a political role after the general election, fueling speculation he aims to stay on as prime minister.
Four of his cabinet ministers have launched a political party that could back Prayut.
On Sunday, Thaksin's old Puea Thai Party chose new leaders to take it into the election.

An election date has not been set but senior government official have said that it would likely be on Feb. 24.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Sri Lanka's ousted prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe protested in the capital Colombo on Tuesday as political turmoil on the island entered its fifth day.
Sri Lanka was plunged into crisis on Friday when the country's President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and swore in ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa to replace him, breaking up a fragile coalition governing the country.
Sirisena has suspended parliament to the anger of supporters of Wickremesinghe, who say the president is trying to prevent lawmakers from keeping him in power. 
On Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered near Wickremesinghe's residence in the south of the capital, holding signs calling on Sirisena to ""protect our democracy"".
""This is a coup. It has all the characteristics of a coup,"" one of the protesters, Deepanjalie Abeywardene, told Reuters, while holding a sign which read ""reconvene the parliament"". 
""This is a third-grade act by Sirisena. We voted him as the president to ensure democracy,"" said P. Ariyadasa, a 62-year-old farmer from Mesawachchiya, 230 km from Colombo.
Sirisensa named a new cabinet on Monday with Rajapaksa in charge of finance.
But some of Wickremesinghe's ousted ministers have refused to accept his sacking. 
On Sunday, former oil minister Arjuna Ranatunga attempted to enter his office, leading to violence that left two dead. 
The speaker of Sri Lanka's parliament Karu Jayasuriya has also refused to recognise Rajapaksa as the new prime minister, warning of ""bloodshed"" if the standoff moves to the streets.
The power struggle in Sri Lanka comes at a critical time for the country's economy, with credit rating agencies warning that ongoing political turmoil could raise financing costs and lower foreign capital inflow as it attempts to refinance sizable government debts.
Sri Lanka is also a key state in the battle for influence in south Asia between traditional ally India and China. The Chinese government has been one of the few to congratulate the pro-Beijing Rajapaksa on becoming prime minister.

International Petroleum Investment Co, known as IPIC, and 1MDB had reached an agreement last year in a payment dispute over 1MDB bonds that IPIC had guaranteed.
The Malaysian fund had agreed to pay $1.2 billion to IPIC and assumed responsibility for future principal and interest payments for the bonds. 
Najib was prime minister then, but he lost an election earlier this year to Mahathir Mohamad and has since been charged with corruption in 1MDB-related probes. He has pleaded not guilty and consistently denied any wrongdoing.
""The base of Malaysia's legal challenge in the High Court in London is that the consent award was procured by fraud or in a manner contrary to public policy,"" Attorney General Tommy Thomas said in a statement. 
He said Malaysia was obliged to pay $5.78 billion to IPIC and the bond trustee over five years under the 2017 award, but it will now seek relief from future obligations and also seek to recover the $1.46 billion already paid. 
""Fraud is an established ground to challenge the consent award for public policy reasons,"" Thomas said, adding that the application to challenge the agreement will be filed on Tuesday.
Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, which merged with IPIC last year, said it was not aware of any legal action challenging the outcome of the arbitration.
""There remains in place a legally-binding settlement agreement that was agreed to by the arbitrating parties,"" Mubadala said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
It said 1MDB did not currently owe any debt to IPIC or Mubadala.
""The 1MDB group issued $3.5 billion of notes to various noteholders for which IPIC has given guarantees to those noteholders. As issuer, the 1MDB group has the primary liability to pay the noteholders regular interest coupons and to repay the principal amount at maturity,"" it said. 
1MDB is the subject of money-laundering and corruption investigations in at least six countries, including Malaysia and the United States. 
Last week, Najib was slapped with four charges of corruption over the settlement agreement with IPIC by prosecutors.

Days after Meng's wife reported him missing, prompting France to open an inquiry, China said he was under investigation for bribery and other violations. Interpol, based in the French city of Lyon, said Meng had resigned as president. 
But no word has been heard from Meng himself since he sent his wife a WhatsApp message on Sept. 25 saying ""wait for my call"". Grace Meng said she had decided to retain the law firms in London and Paris to pursue her husband's case.

""Above all, I urge everyone to raise their voice in asking China to respect our family's fundamental human rights,"" she said. ""His disappearance could not be for anything other than political reasons.""
It is unclear where Meng, 64, is being held and it has not been possible for Reuters to reach him for comment. It is also unclear if he has been allowed to retain legal representation.
Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China protects the legitimate rights of all Chinese citizens, no matter what situation they find themselves in.
China has already told his wife that if she wants to contact him by telephone then that can be arranged ""at any time"", Lu told a daily news briefing.
""But Meng Hongwei's wife, on the one hand says she doesn't know where he is, and on the other hand refuses to contact him by telephone. Why? We don't know.""
French authorities have said that Meng's wife and their children are under police protection in Lyon after receiving threats.
Meng, a deputy minister of public security in China, became president of Interpol in late 2016 amid a broader effort by China to secure leadership posts in international organizations.

Presidents of the international police organization are seconded from their national administrations. They remain in their home post while representing the body.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party has been turning up the heat on some controversial and potentially highly divisive religious issues in recent days, with crucial state elections only weeks away and a general election due by next May.
Top officials from his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sided with some Hindus defying a court order that scrapped a ban on women of menstruating age from visiting a famous temple in southern India.
At the same time, they and leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Hindu-first group from which the BJP was born, are for the first time demanding an urgent executive order that would bypass the Supreme Court, to build a Hindu temple at the site of a mosque in the north of the country.
The destruction of the mosque by a frenzied Hindu mob in 1992 sparked deadly riots across the country.
""There should not even be any debate over it. There's not even any need to involve the courts here,"" BJP's Giriraj Singh, a federal minister, said on Monday after the top court delayed a hearing on whether the disputed site should be handed to Hindus or Muslims until at least January.
""If Hindus lose patience, I am afraid no one can say what will happen.""
Officially, the BJP says it represents all Indians, irrespective of religion. But while Modi has adopted economic development as his driving philosophy since being elected prime minister in 2014, the BJP has not shied away from openly endorsing causes of its mainly Hindu support base.
BJP spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal said a decree on building the temple was indeed one of the options before the government as ""justice delayed is justice denied"" and ""emotions are running high"". A government spokesman did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
A BJP minister in one state that goes to the polls soon, Rajasthan, called on Friday on all Hindus to vote along religious lines, for the BJP, in what may be a breach of election rules.
Religion is a deeply political issue in the world's biggest democracy, which has seen a number of deadly communal riots between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, including days of violence when Modi was chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.
The BJP denies it has a bias against Muslims, but says it is opposed to giving unfair advantage to any community, a practice it describes as ""appeasement"" and alleges the opposition Congress party of long following to win votes.
Five states elect their assemblies this year, starting next month, ahead of the general election in which the BJP is projected to lose seats in parliament but still emerge as the single biggest party.
WARNING OVER COURT VERDICT
Hitting out at the government of the state of Kerala, which has arrested more than 3,000 people who demonstrated against the Supreme Court's lifting of a centuries-old bar on women or girls aged 10 to 50 from entering the hill temple of Sabarimala, BJP President Amit Shah said on Saturday that the party would stand with the protesters ""like a rock"".
""I can cite many court judgments that were never implemented,"" Shah said at a rally in Kerala on Saturday. ""Why are you hell bent on implementing this particular court order? I am here to warn the Kerala government, don't suppress the devotees in the name of the court verdict.""
The comments drew criticism from political analysts and opposition parties including Kerala's ruling Communist party, which accused Shah of attacking the top court and constitution for political gains.
""He will divide, polarize, and fan anger, hatred, violence —anything to win elections,"" Ramachandra Guha, a historian, said in a tweet. ""He is the most dangerous and divisive politician in the history of independent India.""
RAM TEMPLE
Many BJP leaders, including the BJP chief minister of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous with 220 million people, are urging the top court to allow the construction of a temple for Hindu God Ram in the state where the Babri Mosque was demolished by a mob.
Hindus believe that the town of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. Many Hindus believe that the exact spot of his birth was where the Babri Mosque had stood and that there should be a temple there.
The BJP's manifesto for the 2014 election said it was committed to ""explore all possibilities within the framework of the constitution"" to make that happen.
""I will appeal to the Supreme Court, if they can give a verdict on Sabarimala, they should also decide on the issue of Lord Ram's birthplace,"" Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a saffron robe-wearing Hindu priest, said in New Delhi on Saturday to cheers from the audience.
There are fears that communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, the biggest minority group in India with more than 170 million people, could flare again if the status quo is disturbed. At the moment the site is under court control.
""We want a decision soon. We want a law to build the temple,"" said Mohan Bhagwat, the powerful chief of the RSS in a speech this month.
Dhan Singh Rawat, a BJP minister in Rajasthan, on Friday appealed to all Hindus to vote for the party like all ""Muslims unitedly vote for the Congress"", the main opposition party.
Election Commission guidelines https://www.eci.nic.in/archive/handbook/CANDIDATES/cap14/cap14_1.htm say seeking votes in the name of religion, caste, race, community or language is ""corrupt practice"".

""Many people are trying to pollute the minds of the voters by talking about polarizing issues,"" said Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a Muslim lawyer and community leader in the southern city of Hyderabad. ""We're advising our people to ignore these political stunts. We're religious but we have friends from all religions.""

The agreement forged in September between Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally, and Turkey, which backs the rebels, staved off a major government offensive into the opposition-held Idlib region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Ankara was fulfilling its obligations in Idlib.
But Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in comments reported late on Monday that Turkey appeared unwilling to implement the deal.
""The terrorists still exist with their heavy arms in this region and this is an indicator of Turkey's unwillingness to fulfill its obligations,"" Moualem said in Damascus, according to the official news agency SANA.
The Syrian government has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of Syria, including the Idlib region.
The Turkish-Russian agreement established a buffer zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) deep into rebel territory that was to be free of heavy weapons and jihadists by mid October.
The main jihadist group in the northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, gave a nod of approval to the Turkish agreement, but without explicitly saying it would abide by it.
Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of the anti-Assad insurgency.
Turkey has established 12 military positions in the northwest under a previous agreement with Russia and Iran, Assad's other main ally.
The United Nations warned that any major offensive into the Idlib region would cause a humanitarian catastrophe. The region is home to around 3 million people.

Khaleda's opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has been in disarray after she was jailed in February, following a verdict it says aimed at keeping the 73-year-old leader and her family out of politics.
""Now, there’s no chance for the BNP chief to contest the next election,"" Khurshid Alam Khan, a lawyer for the government, told reporters after Tuesday's High Court decision.
Khaleda, who has been receiving treatment in hospital this month for arthritis and diabetes, did not appear in court, and was not represented by a lawyer.
Zainul Abedin, a lawyer for the former prime minister, said he would comment later on Tuesday, following consultations.
In February, Khaleda, her son and aides were convicted of stealing 21 million taka ($253,000) in foreign donations for an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister, from 2001 to 2006. Khaleda has denied any wrongdoing.
On Monday, a court sentenced her to seven years in prison for misappropriation of 31.5 million taka ($371,550) from a trust in 2005.
The BNP has rejected that judgment as ""state-sponsored"", and is staging a nationwide protest against it on Tuesday. It has urged the government to free Khaleda and called for a neutral caretaker government to be put in place before December's vote. 
A court this month sentenced Khaleda's son, the party's acting chief, Tarique Rahman, who lives in exile in London, to life in jail over a plot to assassinate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2004.
The party has dismissed that accusation as part of a ploy aimed at keeping the family out of politics.
Last month, Khaleda said there was ""no justice"" as she appeared before a makeshift court set up in the prison to fast-track her trial.

Khaleda and Hasina, both related to former national leaders, have dominated politics in poverty-stricken Bangladesh for more than two decades, nursing a long and bitter rivalry.

In a directive sent to all schools last week, the education ministry said parents had complained in the past about their children trying to collect money and asking for Halloween costumes.
Stressing that Halloween was not an officially recognized holiday, it ordered all schools to put a stop to organized celebrations this year. 
Halloween has become increasingly popular in the capital Ulaanbaatar.
""Our school has specialized classes in the English language, and that's why we celebrated Halloween in many different ways,"" said G. Erdenechimeg, a social worker at the 23rd School in Ulaanbaatar, which focuses on foreign languages.
""Generally, it's all about the children's attitude,"" she added. ""Some may get into their roles too deeply or misuse (Halloween) and have a negative social effect. For this reason, it has been decided not to celebrate."" 
Mongolia has undergone a rapid transformation since its Moscow-backed Communist regime collapsed in 1990, with a succession of governments trying to modernize the economy and open up to foreign investment. 
In a bid to offset the impact of giant neighbors Russia and China, Mongolia has also courted ""third neighbors"" like the United States and Japan, leading to growing cultural ties. 
But the rapid pace of change has stoked concerns that its nomadic and Buddhist culture is being left behind.
Halloween celebrations are still expected to continue in Ulaanbaatar, home to nearly half of Mongolia's population of 3 million.
""I haven't seen the decision have any impact or affect our sales so far,"" said D. Purev, owner of the Party Shop, which stocks Halloween-related goods in Ulaanbaatar.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan threw rubber gumboots on Tuesday as children cheered in a competition in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland, though Harry's team ended up losing to his wife's side. 
A 6.1 magnitude earthquake felt by thousands of people in New Zealand did not disrupt the schedule of the couple, who are on the final leg of a Pacific tour that has included Australia, Fiji and Tonga. [nL3N1XA1OO] 
""There wasn't too much of a rivalry,"" Isabella Iti, 10, said after the gumboot toss. ""I think she was thinking that there was no chance that she would win. But she did.""
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were visiting a conservation area north of Auckland that had been set aside as part of a Commonwealth initiative to honor Queen Elizabeth's 66 years on the British throne. 
There, the couple split off and each led a team of cheering children in a competition to see who could throw a rubber rainboot - known locally as a 'gumboot' - the farthest.
Meghan, wearing black J Crew jeans and a Karen Walker blazer, led her team to victory after tossing a blue boot about a meter (3.2 feet) further than Harry's red one.
Gumboot throwing is famously associated with the rural town of Taihape, around 420 km (260 miles) south of Auckland, which hosts an annual gumboot festival. 
Mike Jebsen, chief executive of the QEII National Trust, said the mayor of Taihape gave his blessing to hold the gumboot competition. 
""We wanted to give the royal couple a taste of rural New Zealand, and there's nothing more quintessentially Kiwi than a gumboot throw!"" he said.
In the afternoon, Meghan and Harry traveled to South Auckland to visit the head office of Pillars, a charity that mentors the children of prisoners. 
For their wedding in May, Meghan and Harry had asked for charitable donations in lieu of gifts. The New Zealand government gave NZ$5,000 ($3,271) to Pillars in recognition of couple's interest in programs that support vulnerable children.

JAVA SEA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian divers resumed a search on Tuesday for an airliner that crashed with 189 people on board, as ""pinger locators"" tried to zero in on its cockpit recorders and uncover why an almost-new plane went down in the sea minutes after take-off.
Indonesia, one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, has a patchy safety record. With the now almost certain prospect of all on board having died, the crash is set to rank as its second-worst air disaster.
Ground staff lost contact with flight JT610 of budget airline Lion Air 13 minutes after the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft took off early on Monday from the airport in Jakarta, the capital, on its way to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
""Hopefully this morning we can find the wreckage or fuselage,"" Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of a national transport safety panel, told Reuters, adding that underwater ""pinger locators"", including equipment from Singapore, were being deployed to help find the aircraft's black boxes.
The priority is finding the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to help determine the cause of the disaster, safety experts said.
Although divers stopped searching overnight, sonar vessels and an underwater drone kept up the hunt for the wreckage, where many victims were feared trapped, officials said.
Only debris and body parts have been found off the shore of Karawang, east of Jakarta.
A Reuters witness on a boat at the crash site, saw teams of divers in black rubber suits enter the slightly choppy water from six inflatable boats.
""The visibility is not good as it's very overcast,” a special forces officer said, noting the dive team had started just after dawn and been down to a depth of 35 meters.
Underwater footage released by the national search and rescue agency showed relatively poor visibility. In all, 35 vessels are helping to search.
(For graphic on flight path of Indonesia’s Lion Air flight JT610, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OZPYBz)
DNA CHECKS
Yusuf Latif, the spokesman of the search and rescue agency, had said on Monday finding survivors ""would be a miracle"", judging by the condition of the recovered debris and body parts.
Lion Air said human remains were collected in 24 body bags after sweeps of the site, in waters about 30 to 35 meters (98 to 115 ft) deep roughly 15 km (nine miles) off the coast.
Officers at Jakarta's port picked through personal belongings retrieved from the sea, including wallets, backpacks and papers, in a bid to help identify their owners.
Dozens of relatives gathered at a police hospital where body bags were brought for forensic doctors to try to identify victims.
Police were taking saliva swabs from family members of the missing for DNA tests and also seeking details on body markings like tatoos or birthmarks on the passengers.
A tent has been set up next to the hospital building and a middle age woman and a teenager sat together, sobbing and comforting each other.
BOEING PROVIDING ASSISTANCE
The pilot of flight JT610 had asked to return to base shortly after take-off about 6.20 a.m. Investigators are trying to determine why the pilot issued the request, which was granted.
No distress signal was received from the aircraft's emergency transmitter.
The aircraft suffered a technical problem on a flight from the resort island of Bali to Jakarta on Sunday but it was ""resolved according to procedure"", Edward Sirait, chief executive of Lion Air Group, told reporters.
Sirait declined to specify the nature of the issue but said none of the airline's other aircraft of that model had the same problem. Lion had operated 11 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and it had no plan to ground the rest of them, he said.
On Monday, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said they were providing assistance in the crash investigation.
(For details of search, crash inquiry, please click on)
The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's workhorse single-aisle jet.
Two witnesses described the plane as swaying or rocking as it came down, adding that the nose hit the water first and there was a tall column of smoke afterwards.
The aircraft did not make a noise when it came down, they said.
""From a long way off, it was already leaning,” said Gauk, a fisherman who uses one name.
Privately owned Lion Air, founded in 1999, said the aircraft, which had been in operation since August, was airworthy, with its pilot and co-pilot together having amassed 11,000 hours of flying time.

Indonesia's worst air disaster was in 1997, when a Garuda Indonesia A300 crashed in the city of Medan, killing 234 people.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top court ruled on Tuesday Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (T:5401) should compensate four South Koreans for their forced labor during World War Two, a decision that could freeze ties between the uneasy neighbors.
Nippon Steel said the verdict was ""deeply regrettable"" and that it would review it before taking any next steps. Japan's Foreign Ministry said it would summon the South Korean ambassador.
In a landmark ruling, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld a 2013 order for the company to pay 100 million won ($87,700) to each of the four steel workers who initiated the suit in 2005, seeking compensation and unpaid wages. 
The court ruled that the former laborers' right to reparation was not terminated by a 1965 treaty normalizing diplomatic ties, rejecting the claim by Tokyo and Japanese courts, Yonhap news agency said.
Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan's 35-year occupation of the Korean peninsula until 1945 and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels. 
Japan's Foreign Ministry told Reuters that the issue of compensation was ""settled completely and finally"" by the 1965 deal.
Lee Choon-shik, the 98-year-old sole surviving plaintiff, welcomed the ruling, saying in a televised news conference that it was ""heartbreaking to see it today, left alone alive"". 
Some Seoul officials and experts fear the court's decision, final and binding, could bring repercussions for relations. 
If Nippon Steel refuses to compensate, the plaintiffs could request a seizure of the company's property in South Korea, which may result in an exit of some Japanese businesses and a cut in investment. 
South Korea's foreign ministry said in 2016 any seizure of company assets could drive relations into an ""irreversible catastrophe"".
""We might have to brace for not only a diplomatic crisis but a pull-out of some Japanese firms and a fall in new investment,"" said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.
Nippon Steel could seek international arbitration, said Jin Chang-soo, president of the Sejong Institute think tank.
""It's possible that the case will escalate, stoke anti-Japanese sentiment here and spill over into other areas including security at a time when we need to closely work with Japan to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue,"" Jin said.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The man charged in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre appeared in court shackled to a wheelchair on Monday as some Jewish leaders and the mayor objected to U.S. President Donald Trump's planned visit to the city on the first day of funerals for the victims.
Robert Bowers, the man accused of shooting 11 worshipers to death at the Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday, sat stony-faced and mostly silent before a U.S. magistrate judge, who ordered him held without bond in the deadliest attack ever on America's Jewish community.
The onetime truck driver, who frequently posted anti-Semitic material online and was described by neighbors as a loner, was charged with 29 federal felony counts and could face the death penalty if convicted. 
Prosecutors have said they are treating the mass shooting as a hate crime. The bloodshed heightened a national debate over Trump's inflammatory political rhetoric, which his critics say has contributed to fomenting a surge in right-wing extremism in the United States.
""Yes, words matter,"" Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, said during a CNN interview on Monday.
Over the weekend, Trump branded Saturday's shooting an act of pure evil but also angered some by telling reporters the slaying might have been prevented had an armed guard been present at the synagogue.
The White House nevertheless said the president would visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday with first lady Melania Trump to ""express the support of the American people and grieve with the Pittsburgh community."" 
FIRST BURIALS
The trip would come just a week before the hotly contested Nov. 6 congressional elections that will determine whether Trump's Republican Party will retain a majority in Congress. 
It also will coincide with at least the first two funerals scheduled for the slain worshipers - David Rosenthal, 54, and his brother Cecil Rosenthal, 59.
The Trump administration has rejected the notion he has encouraged white nationalists and neo-Nazis who have embraced him. But a group of local Jewish leaders told Trump in an open letter on Monday he was ""not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.""
More than 27,000 people have signed the letter, organized and posted online by the Pittsburgh chapter of Bend the Arc, a Jewish organization devoted to opposing ""the immoral agenda of the Trump administration and the Republican Party.""
Trump drew bipartisan condemnation last year for saying ""many sides"" were to blame for violence that erupted during a ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and during a torch-lit march the night before by hundreds of right-wing demonstrators chanting, ""White lives matter"" and ""Jews will not replace us."" 
Peduto said he believed Trump should wait until all the funerals were held before coming to Pittsburgh. He suggested Trump's visit and the additional security measures entailed would distract from the ""priority"" of burying the dead.
Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, said, however, on ABC on Monday that the president of the United States was always welcome to visit.
Bowers, 46, is accused of storming into the synagogue in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill section yelling, ""All Jews must die"" as he opened fire on members of three congregations holding Sabbath prayer services there on Saturday morning.
In addition to the 11 mostly elderly worshipers who were killed, six people, including four police officers, were wounded before the suspect was shot by police and surrendered.
Two of the surviving victims remained hospitalized in critical condition.
""Robert Bowers murdered 11 people who were exercising their religious beliefs,"" U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said after the Monday's arraignment, adding a grand jury would hear details of the crime within 30 days. 
The judge ordered Bowers to remain in federal custody and ruled he was entitled to court-appointed counsel. His next hearing was set for Thursday.
Bowers' arraignment was marked by a heavy security presence that included police officers with dogs and a team of sharpshooters at the federal courthouse in Pittsburgh.
Wearing a blue sweatshirt, gray sweatpants, sandals and white socks, with a crewcut and bald spot, Bowers remained expressionless throughout the brief proceeding. 
Bowers said nothing except to give his name, acknowledge he understood the charges against him and that he lacked funds to pay for an attorney. He spoke in a calm voice and signed the papers handed to him with a steady hand. 
Only at the end of the hearing when he was wheeled out of the courtroom did Bowers appear unsettled, turning his head in apparent confusion.
According to an affidavit filed in the case by the FBI, three handguns and an AR-15 rifle were recovered at the scene. 
The complaint quoted Bowers as saying to one law enforcement officer, in substance: ""They're committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews.""

He is charged with 11 counts of obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder - one count for each worshiper killed. Seven other counts of civil rights and firearms offenses stem from the injury of police officers during the assault.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has asked the United States for ""maximum flexibility"" on its request for a waiver to prevent South Korean companies from being affected by renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, the foreign ministry said. 
The sanctions against Iranian crude oil exports are set to take effect on Nov. 5 as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to force Tehran to accede to a more restrictive deal on curbing its nuclear and missile program.
South Korea, a U.S. ally and one of Asia's biggest buyers of Iranian oil, has already stopped crude imports from Iran. South Korean building firms have also canceled energy-related contracts in Iran due to financing difficulties.
Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha asked for the exemption in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo late on Monday, the ministry said in a statement. 
""Minister Kang requested the U.S. side exert maximum flexibility so that South Korea can secure an exemption to minimize the damage to our companies,"" the ministry said.
Pompeo said he noted Seoul's position and would continue discussions on the matter, the ministry said. 
The exemption issue is the latest sign of strain between Seoul and Washington over a range of issues, especially the enforcement of sanctions aimed at limiting North Korea's nuclear and missile program.
South Korea and Japan have been in talks with the United States in a bid to avoid adverse impacts from the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Both countries won waivers during the previous round of sanctions that ended in 2016, but Washington has adopted a more aggressive stance this time.
South Korean buyers of Iranian oil have cut their purchases in recent months due to expensive Middle East grades and uncertainty over trade with Iran. Imports of Iranian oil fell to zero in September for the first time since 2012.
Another risk for South Korean companies is that sanctions will make it difficult to receive and make payments in dollars for projects linked to Iran. 
On Monday, Hyundai Engineering & Construction said it scrapped a 595 billion won ($521 million) deal to build a petrochemicals complex in Iran due to lack of financing. 
In June, Daelim Industrial said a 2.23 trillion won contract to build a refinery project in Iran was canceled due to financing problems.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - A British academic charged with espionage in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been released on bail, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, was arrested on May 5 at Dubai airport after a two-week research visit. He was formally charged this month with spying on the Gulf state, where he has been held in solitary confinement.
The sources did not say when Hedges was released on bail. The UAE's Federal Court of Appeal last week postponed hearing his case until Nov. 21 to re-examine the evidence.
A UAE government spokesperson could immediately be reached for comment outside working hours. 
A spokeswoman for Britain's foreign office in London said: ""We are monitoring developments closely and have made the Emirati authorities aware of all our concerns. We continue to do everything we can for Matthew and his family."" 
The BBC reported Hedges was released on bail without his passport and has been told to remain in the UAE until his next court appearance on Nov. 21. 
The UAE’s attorney general has said Hedges was charged with spying for a foreign state, without naming it, and jeopardizing the military, economic and political security of the country.
More than 120 academics from around the world have issued a petition urging UAE authorities to release him.
According to Durham University’s website, Hedges is a doctoral student in the School of Government and International Affairs whose research interests include civil-military relations, political economy and tribalism.
Last year, he co-authored an article in an academic journal on the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member.
The UAE is a tourism and trade hub for the Middle East, but tolerates little public criticism of its ruling families or policies and staunchly opposes the Islamist ideology of the Brotherhood.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A man accused of mailing 14 pipe bombs to prominent critics of U.S. President Donald Trump was ordered held without bail on Monday, and authorities intercepted a similar suspicious package addressed to CNN in Atlanta.
The latest developments in the bomb case came with just over a week to go in highly charged political campaigns across the nation leading up to Nov. 6 elections. Democrats are battling to seize control of a Congress now held by Trump's Republican Party.
In U.S. District Court on Monday afternoon, Cesar Sayoc, his salt-and-pepper hair pulled back into a ponytail, remained largely silent, only acknowledging Judge Edwin Torres' reading of the charges against him. 
Shackled and wearing a beige jumpsuit, the 56-year-old man began to tear up, and the three attorneys with him stood shoulder to shoulder to obscure news reporters' and photographers' view of him. 
Sayoc was scheduled to appear in court in Miami again on Friday. 
The former male stripper, part-time pizza deliveryman and apparent avid Trump fan is charged with five felony counts: interstate transportation and illegal mailing of explosives, threatening a former president, making threatening interstate communications and assaulting federal officers.
Outside the court, defense attorney Jamie Benjamin called the charges ""flimsy"" and accused the government of trying Sayoc in the media, forcing judgment before the case has gone to court.
""All there is this thin amount of evidence that has been alleged in that complaint,"" Benjamin said.
Sayoc's case is expected to be moved to New York, where he will be prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office there, officials said. 
Earlier on Monday, the FBI said a suspicious package addressed to CNN's headquarters had been intercepted at an Atlanta post office. 
A package containing a bomb sent to CNN's New York offices at the Time Warner Center forced the evacuation on Wednesday of the building.
Tensions stirred by the rash of pipe bombs ratcheted up even further after a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, killing 11 worshipers while yelling ""All Jews must die.""
All of the bombs were sent through the U.S. Postal Service and intercepted before reaching their intended targets. No one has been hurt.
The first of last week's 14 bombs turned up on Oct. 22 in the mailbox of billionaire Democratic donor George Soros' home in the suburb of Katonah, New York.
More bombs were sent to a range of prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and other frequent targets of Trump's scorn.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former Army captain who won Brazil's presidential election by a comfortable margin, received a supportive call from U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and began planning trips to Washington and a conservative ally in Chile.
Bolsonaro, who early in his legislative career declared he was ""in favor"" of dictatorships and demanded that Congress be disbanded, has vowed to adhere to democratic principles while holding up a copy of the country's Constitution.
Trump said he had an ""excellent call"" congratulating Bolsonaro and tweeted about their plans to ""work closely together on trade, military and everything else!""
Investors were quick to cheer Bolsonaro's victory, sending Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) to an all-time high in early trading before turning negative as traders booked profits following a sharp rally this month.
Markets had surged on Bolsonaro's ascent, as he pledged to quickly close Brazil's gaping budget deficit and privatize state firms. But investors said further gains will hinge on clearer signs he will deliver on a market-friendly agenda.
His election alarmed critics around the globe, however, given his defense of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, vows to sweep away leftist political opponents and a track record of denigrating comments about gays, women and minorities.
Bolsonaro's victory brings Brazil's military back into the political limelight after it spent three decades in the barracks following the country's return to civilian rule. Several retired generals will serve as ministers and close advisers.
""You are all my witnesses that this government will defend the constitution, of liberty and of God,"" Bolsonaro said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live video in his first comments after his victory.
The president-elect's future chief of staff told Reuters his first international trip would be to Chile — one of the South American neighbors that swung to the right in recent elections — and soon after that he hoped to visit the United States.
An outspoken Trump admirer, Bolsonaro also vowed to realign Brazil with more advanced economies, such as the United States, overhauling diplomatic priorities after nearly a decade and a half of leftist rule.
CLOSER U.S. TIES 
The 63-year-old former paratrooper joins a list of populist, right-wing figures to win elections in recent years that include Trump, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 
Trump's friendly call augurs closer political ties between the two largest economies in the Americas - both now led by conservative populists promising to overturn the political establishment.
In a telephone call on Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Bolsonaro discussed collaboration on priority foreign policy issues, including Venezuela, tackling transnational crime and ways to strengthen economic ties.
Bolsonaro has vowed to turn up pressure on Venezuela's authoritarian leftist government to hold free elections that could stem the flow of refugees into neighboring Brazil and Colombia, also governed by a conservative president.
Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist with Rio de Janeiro State University, said he was concerned that Brazil would not soon dispel the tense and occasionally violent atmosphere that enveloped the polarizing campaign. 
""It's possible that even with his win, we could see a further wave of violence among Bolsonaro's supporters against those who backed his opponent,"" Santoro said.
Bolsonaro supporters carried out physical attacks and organized campaigns of online harassment in the run-up to Sunday's vote, targeting journalists in particular, according to a tally kept by Abraji, an investigative journalism group. 
Bolsonaro himself was stabbed in the abdomen at a rally last month and will need to undergo surgery in mid-December to remove a colostomy bag before he can travel to Santiago and Washington.
EASY WIN
Bolsonaro won 55 percent of votes in a run-off election against left-wing hopeful Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party (PT), who got 45 percent, according to electoral authority TSE.
The fiery lawmaker's rise has been propelled by rejection of the leftist PT that ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and was ousted two years ago in the midst of a deep recession and political graft scandal.
Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters cheered and set off fireworks outside his home in Rio de Janeiro's beachfront Barra de Tijuca neighborhood as his victory was announced.
""I don't idolize Bolsonaro and I don't know if he will govern well, but we are hopeful. People want the PT out, they can't take any more corruption,"" said Tatiana Cunha, a 39-year-old systems analyst during the noisy celebrations.
Investors have been hopeful that Bolsonaro would carry out fiscal reforms proposed by his orthodox economic guru, Paulo Guedes.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) rose as much as 3 percent to an all-time high in opening trade, led higher by shares of state-owned firms and blue-chips, before retreating and closing 2.2 percent down. 
Brazil's currency, the real , has gained around 10 percent against the dollar this month and interest rate futures have tightened dramatically as Bolsonaro's prospects improved. 
Investors have been particularly heartened by Bolsonaro's choice of Guedes, a Chicago University-trained economist and investment banker, as future economy minister.
Guedes, who wants to privatize an array of state firms, said on Sunday the new government will try to erase Brazil's budget deficit within a year, simplify and reduce taxes, and create 10 million jobs by cutting payroll taxes. New rules will boost investment in infrastructure, he told reporters.
Still, Fitch Ratings on Monday highlighted the ""deep fiscal challenges"" confronting Bolsonaro's team, as weak growth and a huge budget deficit leave little room to maneuver.
""The exact details of how his administration plans to achieve (its) objectives are limited,"" wrote Fitch analysts led by Shelly Shetty. ""The lack of fiscal space, a high unemployment rate and a sluggish economic recovery will also likely limit economic policy options."" 
Onyx Lorenzoni, a fellow congressman whom Bolsonaro has tapped as chief of staff, told journalists that Guedes would be responsible for structuring the government's relationship with an independent, autonomous central bank with targets.
Asked about Brazil's currency, Lorenzoni said Bolsonaro would offer businesses more predictability, but ruled out an exchange rate target. Lorenzoni reiterated his view that efforts to reform Brazil's pension system should wait until next year.
In a separate interview with Reuters, he said the president-elect would meet with Guedes and other members of his team on Tuesday. He will oversee the transition from Rio this week and fly to the capital Brasilia next week, Lorenzoni added.
In parallel, representatives for Bolsonaro will begin meeting with President Michel Temer's team to start work ahead of the Jan. 1 inauguration. 

Retired General Augusto Heleno, slated to become defense minister, told reporters that Bolsonaro has a positive view of a planned $4.75 billion joint venture between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3). He said the Temer government may approve the deal before leaving.

LONDON (Reuters) - The fiancée of Jamal Khashoggi on Monday criticized President Donald Trump's response to his killing, urging him to set aside U.S. trade interests in the push for truth, and demanded Riyadh disclose more details to bring those who ordered it to justice.
The death of Khashoggi - a Washington Post columnist and a critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - sparked global outrage and pitched the world's top oil exporter into crisis.
Trump has hedged his criticism of Saudi leaders over Khashoggi, insisting he does not want to imperil a ""tremendous order"" of $110 billion of weapons he says will support 500,000 U.S. jobs - figures that experts say are highly exaggerated.
His fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, told an audience on a visit to London she was disappointed with Trump's approach.
""I am disappointed by the actions of the leadership in many countries, particularly in the U.S.,"" she said.
""President Trump should help reveal the truth and ensure justice be served. He should not pave the way for a cover-up of my fiance's murder. Let's not let money taint our conscience and compromise our values.""
When asked who was ultimately responsible for the killing, Cengiz told Reuters in an interview in Turkish: ""This took place inside a Saudi diplomatic mission ... In such circumstances, the Saudi Arabian authorities are responsible for this.""
Trump has said Prince Mohammed, who has consolidated control over Saudi security and intelligence agencies over the past three years, bore ultimate responsibility for the operation that led to Khashoggi's killing.
She said the West is considered a stronghold of human rights and democracy so it should stand up to the killers of her husband-to-be.
Khashoggi, 59, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain paperwork necessary for his upcoming marriage to Cengiz, a Turkish national. He did not walk out of the consulate. Cengiz first raised the alarm.
Saudi Arabia initially denied any involvement in Khashoggi's disappearance but a Saudi official eventually attributed his death to a botched attempt to return him to the kingdom.
Later, Riyadh said the killing was premeditated and Prince Mohammed has vowed that the killers would be brought to justice.
Saudi Arabia has detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of the investigation into Khashoggi's murder. Some were members of a 15-man hit team, many of them Saudi intelligence operatives, who flew into Istanbul hours before Khashoggi's death, Turkish security sources say.
MURDER IN ISTANBUL
""This incident, this assassination, took place in the Saudi consulate,"" Cengiz said, speaking through a translator. ""So the Saudi authorities probably know how such a murder took place.""
""They need to explain what happened,"" said Cengiz, who was somber, guarded and appeared at times on the verge of tears.
When asked what she would say to Prince Mohammed if she ever got the chance to speak to him, she said: ""I don't think that will ever happen.""
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who Cengiz praised, has urged Riyadh to disclose who ordered the murder and prosecutors have prepared an extradition request for 18 suspects from Saudi Arabia.
""The explanations given so far by Saudi Arabia are not sufficient,"" Cengiz said. ""I want to know the details of who is responsible.""
Asked if she held Crown Prince Mohammed or the Saudi royal family responsible, she said:
""I and my government would like all those responsible, from the person who gave this order to those who carried it out, to be brought to justice and punished under international law,"" she said.
Cengiz said she had not been contacted by Prince Mohammed or the Saudi royal family, nor offered any condolences by them.
Cengiz met Khashoggi in May at a conference in Istanbul and their relationship blossomed. But the decision to marry in Istanbul, whose mosques reminded Khashoggi of his hometown Medina, set off a paper chase that ultimately ended in death.
Turkish law required that Khashoggi, who was divorced, provide proof that he did not have a wife and thus his trip to the consulate. Cengiz said she had been shown no recordings of what happened inside the consulate and that she got most of her information from the media.

""Like everyone else, I am still waiting for answers,"" she said. ""The world should know who instigated, were involved in and committed this crime.""

QUITO (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Monday that Ecuador is seeking to end his asylum in its London embassy and hand him over to the United States, but a judge rejected his lawsuit over embassy living conditions.
Assange spoke from the embassy via teleconference at a hearing in Quito of a lawsuit challenging the Ecuadorean government requiring him to pay for medical bills, phone calls and clean up after his pet cat.
He took refuge in the embassy six years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden in a sexual assault case that was later dropped. He remains there to avoid being jailed by Great Britain for violating the terms of his bail, which he has said would result in his being handed over to Washington.
During the hearing, Assange said the new rules were a sign Ecuador was trying to push him out, and said Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno had already decided to end his asylum but had not yet officially given the order.
""If Mr. Assange wants to stay and he follows the rules ... he can stay at the embassy as long as he wants,"" said Attorney General Inigo Salvador, adding that Assange's stay had cost the country $6 million. 
Foreign Minister Jose Valencia declined to comment on Assange's assertion that Ecuador sought to hand him over to the United States.
Judge Karina Martinez rejected the lawsuit, saying the Foreign Ministry was in charge of determining his living conditions.
Assange's legal team said it immediately appealed the ruling.
Embassy staff had complained of Assange riding a skateboard in the halls, of playing soccer on the grounds and behaving aggressively with security personnel. 
Ecuador's government also objected to his making online commentary about sensitive political issues in other countries, including publishing opinions about the Catalonia separatist movement in Spain.
The new rules were meant to address these concerns, Salvador said.
The United Kingdom in August had assured Assange that he would not be extradited if he left the embassy, Salvador told reporters last week.
Valencia told Reuters last week that the government was ""frustrated"" by the lawsuit and that it would no longer intervene with British authorities on Assange's behalf.

U.S. federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, have maintained a long-running grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks, which according to one source includes a probe into leaks of Central Intelligence Agency documents to the website. (https://reut.rs/2z8JdlY)

333,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 05:12PM ET</span>","U.S. to deploy over 5,200 troops to Mexico border","By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will deploy over 5,200 troops, including armed soldiers, to bolster President Donald Trump's efforts to secure the border with Mexico as a caravan of migrants treks toward the frontier, a senior U.S. general said on Monday.
General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, said 800 U.S. troops were already en route to the Texas border and 5,200 would be headed to the southwest region by week's end, far higher than the 800 to 1,000 initially forecast.
""That is just the start of this operation. We will continue to adjust the number and inform you of those,"" O'Shaughnessy told reporters. ""But please know that is in addition to the 2,092 that are already employed from our National Guard"" troops."" 
The Pentagon previously declined comment on potential troop numbers, saying that planning was still under way for a mission that risks drawing the U.S. military into a politically charged operation just days ahead of the Nov. 6 mid-term congressional elections.
President Donald Trump, who has seized upon the Central American migrant caravan in campaign rallies ahead of the vote, said on Twitter that the military would be waiting for the procession -- suggesting a far more direct role in confronting the migrants than U.S. defense officials have previously suggested.
""Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. 
""Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!"" he added.
A caravan of mostly Hondurans, estimated to number between 3,500 and 7,000, who left their country in mid-October are now in southern Mexico. Since then, two more caravans of migrants have set off.
Some migrants have abandoned the journey, deterred by the hardships or the possibility instead of making a new life in Mexico. Others joined it in southern Mexico.
There are 2,100 U.S. National Guard forces at the border already, sent after a previous Trump request in April.
U.S. officials told Reuters last week the military would have not have an active law enforcement role, instead sending engineers, pilots and other support staff including some that may be able deal with crowd control on the U.S. side of the border. Pentagon officials declined comment on Monday.
Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis authorized the use of troops and other military resources at the U.S-Mexico border. U.S. officials told Reuters they would begin deploying as soon as Tuesday and their mission was authorized through mid-December, a date that could be extended.
Mattis' authorization last week allowed the military to provide ""mission-enhancing capabilities"" to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help build temporary barriers and housing.
On Sunday, Mattis told reporters that some construction materials were already being moved to the border, including barriers. He said the Department of Defense was still planning the logistics and details of the deployment.
Mattis suggested the mission would take time to develop, saying it would be a ""phased"" operation. U.S. officials have told Reuters the support mission would be coordinated by the U.S. military's Northern Command.
Trump, who campaigned against illegal immigration to win the 2016 U.S. presidential vote, has seized on this caravan in the run-up to the congressional elections, firing up support for his Republican Party, which is seeking to maintain control of Congress.
If the Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives or the Senate, it could become much harder for Trump to pursue his policy agenda in the remaining two years of his term in office.
Trump's decision to call in the military appears to be a departure from past practice, at least in recent years, in which such operations were carried out by National Guard forces -- largely part-time military members who are often called upon to serve in response to domestic emergencies.

The decision to send active duty forces this time gives the Pentagon the ability to more rapidly mobile greater capability than would be immediately available with the Guard, officials tell Reuters.

The 100 victims, many of them from the Belarusian intelligentsia, were among between 600,000 and 1.5 million people in then-Soviet Belarus who were swept up in Stalin's mass repression of dissent that came to a head in 1937. 
At a discrete memorial event on Monday, about 20 people lit candles next to the Minsk headquarters of the KGB security service, the present-day successor to the NKVD. 
In a separate memorial event, several dozens gathered at an execution site used by the NKVD in a wooded area on the Belrusian capital's outskirts that is now marked by dozens of wooden crosses. 
Belarusians read poems as they stood near the crosses decorated with burning candles.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party has for weeks been seeking a dialogue process with the opposition, according to four sources involved in the effort, but the opposition remains broadly skeptical of new talks following the failure of previous rounds.
Three dialogue proceedings between allies of President Nicolas Maduro and his adversaries, the most recent of which collapsed in February, ended in bitter recriminations and complaints that Maduro used them to distract from human rights abuses and a five-year economic crisis.
In recent weeks, government allies approached opposition politicians, diplomats and church authorities to begin the process again, according to the sources, two of which are linked to the government and two to the opposition. All the sources declined to be identified. 
One of the opposition sources said the government had made the first move to seek dialogue and the approach had Maduro's support. 
The effort indicates that Maduro's government may be seeking to burnish its image in the run-up to the Jan. 10 inauguration for his second term following his re-election this year in a vote that was widely considered a sham.
The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The effort so far has involved preliminary talks associated with the Boston Group, an informal group of Venezuelan politicians from both sides of the political divide that was originally created in 2002 with the help of U.S. politicians from the state of Massachusetts.
The group is bringing in Harvard mediation expert Jim Tull to lead a coaching session for members of the Boston Group, which includes opposition and government legislators.
U.S. Senator Bob Corker urged renewed meetings of the Boston Group when he visited Venezuela in early October, according to two of the sources.
However, an internal Boston Group document warns that a ""brainstorming committee"" set up during Corker's visit is not intended as a ""tool of mediation, negotiation, arbitration or conflict resolution."" 
""(The committee) provides ideas to representatives of these processes if they were to exist,"" the document read.
Tull could not be immediately reached for comment. Corker's office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Members of the Boston Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As rumors of a dialogue plan grew over the weekend, three opposition parties issued a statement openly opposing any such effort.
Popular Will, Justice First and Radical Cause, in a statement on Sunday, said they opposed any dialogue on the grounds that conditions do not exist for ""a fruitful mediation that can bring an end to the dictatorship.""

Henry Ramos of Democratic Action, another opposition party, told local media that government efforts to kick-start dialogue had flopped.

The Sept. 17 downing by Syrian anti-aircraft fire, after Israeli jets attacked a suspected Iranian arms shipment to Syria, caused a diplomatic rift between Israel and Russia, and Moscow blamed Israel for the incident. 
The Israeli official did not give details of the nature of Israel's actions since the shooting down of the IL-20 aircraft near Latakia, in which the crew of 15 were killed, or the number of times it had attacked. 
""The IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) have attacked in Syria, including after the downing of the Russian plane. Military coordination with the Russians continues as before,"" said the senior official, who could not be named.
Israel's Channel 1 television said one air strike was aimed at an Iranian shipment for Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas of equipment intended to greatly increase the accuracy of their rockets and missiles.
Israel, which has carried out air strikes in Syria many times during Syria's seven-and-a-half-year-old civil war, said after the Sept. 17 incident it would work to improve ""deconfliction"" of its missions with Russian forces, but would not halt them.
But since the Russian plane was shot down shortly after Israeli jets attacked a nearby target, there have been no reports of Israeli air strikes in Syria. 
The apparent pause raised speculation in the Israeli media that Israel was either holding back at Russia's request or had paused the attacks over concern that they would fuel further tensions with Moscow.
Netanyahu said earlier this month that he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin ""soon"" to discuss security cooperation. Russia said it had upgraded Syria’s air defenses with the S-300 missile system after accusing Israel of indirect responsibility for the incident.

Two young people died south of Rome when a tree hit the car they were traveling in, while another person was killed in the nearby town of Terracina in a similar accident. A 21-year-old man was killed by a falling tree as he was walking in Naples.
Dozens of trees were reported uprooted across Rome and many parks were closed. Local authorities urged residents to put off non-essential travel. 
Schools were closed in the Italian capital, as well as in dozens of municipalities in the north of the country, which bore the brunt of the rainfall.

The airport will be able to handle 90 million passengers a year, and can be expanded to accommodate as many as 200 million, Erdogan said.
For the first two months, however, it will be used for just a few flights within Turkey and to Azerbaijan and northern Cyprus - a setback for authorities hailing it as a centerpiece of the construction boom that has driven breakneck economic growth under Erdogan's 15-year rule.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Erdogan said the hub would be called ""Istanbul Airport"", and would further Turkey's integration into the global economy.
""With the operation of Istanbul Airport, European air space will have to be restructured,"" he said, adding that he expected it to be used for a large number of intercontinental flights.
The airport has been dogged by criticism over working conditions and safety standards. In February, the labor ministry said 27 workers had died since construction started in 2015, and last month police detained hundreds of protesting workers.
Former transport minister Ahmet Arslan originally said that all flights to and from Istanbul's Ataturk Airport - one of Europe's five busiest - would transfer to the new airport within 48 hours of Monday's opening.
But the flagship carrier, Turkish Airlines, now says only some flights to Ankara, Izmir and Antalya, as well as international flights to northern Cyprus and Azerbaijan, will be using the new airport for now. Its other routes will remain at Ataturk for the rest of this year.
Istanbul is a major hub for transit flights, attracting lucrative transfer traffic this year from major airports in the Gulf as Turkey recovers from security worries, according to the travel data analysis company Forward Keys.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she would not seek re-election as party chairwoman and that her fourth term as chancellor would be her last, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics.
Merkel, 64, has been chairwoman of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. Her decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
Merkel made the announcement a day after Sunday's vote in the state of Hesse, at which the CDU came first but suffered a slump in support from the last election there in 2013.
""I have the firm feeling that today the time has come to open a new chapter,"" Merkel, looking serious but calm, told reporters in Berlin after a meeting of the CDU's leadership.
Drawing the consequences of the CDU's weak result in Hesse and dissatisfaction with her coalition, she said: ""Firstly, at the next CDU party congress in December in Hamburg, I will not put myself forward again as candidate for the CDU chair.""
""Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor. At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand,"" she added.
The move sets in motion the process for the CDU to settle on and groom Merkel's successor. It caused the euro to fall briefly and German government bond yields rose. 
Stepping down as CDU chairwoman further undermines Merkel's authority, as she had previously said the party chair and chancellery should be held by the same person.
Her authority has already been dented this year by the two regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
""We are witnessing a continuation of the pattern in place ever since Merkel’s mistakes in the 2015 migration crisis: the gradual but steady erosion of her political power,"" said Carsten Nickel, managing director at Teneo, a consultancy.
""Rather than outright instability in Germany and Europe, it simply means a continuation of the current leadership vacuum.""
Monday's news came as a surprise to CDU party officials, who had expected Merkel to seek re-election as chairwoman at a party congress in Hamburg in early December. 
The shock move started the race in the CDU to succeed Merkel. It also raises questions about whether she can stage manage a smooth exit. 
Merkel is under pressure from her Social Democrat coalition partners to deliver more policy results and the center-left party could yet pull out of the government at a mid-term review next year.
Germany's other leading CDU chancellors - Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl - both had messy ends to their time in office.
SUCCESSION RACE
Merkel standing down from the party chair will allow a new CDU chairman or chairwoman to build a profile before the next national election.
Merkel said CDU party Secretary General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Health Minister Jens Spahn - a leading critic of the chancellor - had announced they would seek the party chair. Party sources said Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance, would also run.
Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.
When Merkel came into office in 2005, George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac was in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair was British prime minister.
In Sunday's vote in Hesse, the CDU came out top but lost 11 percentage points in support from the last election in 2013.
""With these latest results, it has simply become untenable that Merkel continues to lead the CDU,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio called on Monday for unity within his 5-Star Movement after the anti-establishment party was forced to renege on an electoral pledge to halt a major, international gas transport project.
Former party sympathizers set fire to the 5-Star flag in the southern Italian town of Melendugno on Sunday to protest at the government's decision to endorse the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) that will bring Azeri gas into Italy via their coastline.
Ahead of elections in March, 5-Star promised to abandon the project if it took power, but after months of deliberations, Di Maio acknowledged at the weekend that the pipeline would have to go ahead. He said Italy would face penalties of 20 billion euros ($23 billion) if it pulled out at this late stage.
Facing ridicule and criticism on social media, Di Maio said the party was under attack, both from inside and out, and urged 5-Star supporters to close ranks in the same way ancient Roman soldiers locked their shields together to keep out enemy arrows.
""Today, in our army, some people are showing signs of weakness ... We cannot allow ourselves such weakness,"" Di Maio wrote on the party website. 
""The slightest failure on any front means that all the land we have conquered will return to being no-man's land."" 
The 5-Star formed a coalition with the far-right League in June and is battling against the restraints of government, which sometimes clash with its anti-establishment roots.
Besides giving way on the TAP, Di Maio has also had to ignore party objections to keeping the giant Ilva steelworks open. He is also having to back a tax amnesty which was endorsed by the League but is anathema to his own supporters.
HIGH-SPEED ANXIETY
Di Maio said he only found out how much it would cost to cancel TAP after he had taken office and gained access to official documents. Ministers from the former government denied his version of events and said all documentation was public. 
""They are lying,"" ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi said.
""5-Star promised to block (TAP) within two weeks (of taking office) ...They won votes on the back of this promise. After six months they changed their mind. We lost the election, Italy has lost time. Di Maio has lost face,"" Renzi said in a statement.
With TAP and Ilva moving ahead, attention is switching to another major project that 5-Star has always opposed and that is under consideration - a high-speed rail link known as TAV that is meant to connect Turin with the French city of Lyon.
Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of 5-Star, called timeout on the project in June, saying he wanted a cost-benefit analysis of the 270-km (167-mile) line.
The Turin newspaper La Stampa quoted Di Maio on Monday as warning the League that his party would implode if TAV went ahead. 
However, the League supports the link, which involves building a 57-km tunnel under the Alps, arguing that it will strengthen big business in the League's northern heartlands.

""I hope the government, having given the green light to the so-called TAP in Puglia, will not offer up the Turin-Lyon line and other major projects in the north as a sacrificial lamb to make up to (5-Star) voters,"" said Sergio Chiamparino, a League politician, who heads the Piedmont region centred on Turin.

GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian man and wounded 25 including two medics on Monday during Palestinian protests along the Gaza Strip's beachfront border with Israel, the Gaza Health Ministry said.
Witnesses said dozens of protesters in the northern Gaza Strip burned tires and threw stones at Israeli soldiers stationed behind Israel's frontier fence and that troops fired live bullets and tear gas.
The Gaza Health Ministry said a 27-year-old Palestinian man was killed by the Israeli gunfire.
The Israeli military, estimating the crowd at around 3,000 people, said explosive devices were also thrown at troops deployed on the Israeli side of the fence along the beach.
The soldiers, a military spokesman said, responded with ""riot dispersal means and live fire"".
Gaza medics have tallied 217 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces during almost seven months of protests that have included brief breaches of the border fence and the launching of incendiary balloons that have torched fields in southern Israel.
On Sunday, three Palestinian boys were killed in an Israeli air strike at the Gaza frontier, medics said. Israel said it targeted Palestinians trying to blow up part of the fence.
Some of the protesters on Monday held photos of the three youngsters. The Health Ministry said two were aged 13 and one was a 14-year-old.
Palestinians say they are protesting against Israel's blockade of the territory and in support of a right for Palestinian refugees to return to land lost during Israel's founding in 1948. 
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a sniper during the more than seven months of protests.
Israel says its lethal response to the protests is necessary to prevent armed infiltration from Gaza, which is run by the Hamas Islamist militant group. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2007.
Violence along the border has occasionally escalated into Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes, with Egypt and the United Nations repeatedly mediating ceasefires.
Two million Palestinians live in tiny Gaza, most of them stateless descendants of people who fled or were driven from homes in Israel during its founding 70 years ago.
The enclave is in a state of economic collapse, the World Bank says, citing the restrictions on Palestinian movement and the import of goods that Israel and Egypt have enforced along the Gaza border.
The two countries have said those measures stem from security concerns.

Witnesses described a blast on the central Habib Bourguiba avenue where police were cordoning off the area near the capital's landmark Municipal Theatre. The ministry said eight police officers were among the wounded.
Ambulances could be heard rushing to the scene.
""I was in front of the theater and heard a huge explosion,"" witness Mohamed Ekbal bin Rajib told Reuters.
Tunisia, which is heavily dependent on tourism, has improved security since a series of militant attacks targeting tourists caused the near collapse of the sector three years ago.
In 2015, 21 people were killed during a hostage siege in its national museum, the Bardo in Tunis, and a gunman killed 38 people on a resort beach.
There have been no attacks on that scale since then, but the economy has remained troubled and the authorities worry about militants who shelter in neighboring Libya.
Tunisia is one of the few Arab democracies, and the only country to throw off a long-serving autocrat during the Arab Spring popular revolts of 2011 without triggering large scale unrest or civil war.

LEICESTER, England (Reuters) - The weeping wife and son of Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha laid a wreath outside the soccer club's stadium on Monday as tributes poured in after the Thai tycoon's death in a helicopter crash.
Vichai and four others were killed when his helicopter crashed next to the King Power stadium and then exploded after a Premier League match on Saturday.
His wife Aimon and son Khun joined hundreds of fans at the stadium where a mass of messages, floral tributes, shirts and scarves were laid in honor of the father of four and founder of duty-free King Power International who was a huge favorite with the club's supporters.
""It is with the deepest regret and a collective broken heart that we confirm our chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was among those to have tragically lost their lives on Saturday evening when a helicopter carrying him and four other people crashed outside King Power Stadium,"" a club statement said on Sunday.
The other victims two members of his staff, Nursara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz, Leicestershire Police said.
The aircraft came down in a car park near the King Power stadium shortly after 19:30 GMT, about an hour after the end of Leicester City's game against West Ham United.
Britain's Air Accident Investigations Branch said it had sent a team to examine the wreckage and had recovered the helicopter's flight data recorder.
""Today, our inspectors in Farnborough will start working on the recorder, which was subject to intense heat as a result of the post-accident fire,"" the AAIB said in a statement.
""We expect to be here until the end of the week, at which point we will transport the wreckage to our specialist facilities in Farnborough for more detailed examination. In the meantime, we are still gathering evidence as part of our investigation.""
Vichai bought the unheralded central England side in 2010 and went on to stun the soccer world by beating odds of 5,000/1 to win the Premier League title in 2016 in what amounted to a sporting fairy tale.
Prime Minister Theresa May was among the many who sent messages of condolence while tributes have flooded in from Leicester players and across the soccer world.
Britain's Prince William, President of the English Football Association, said he had known Vichai for several years.
""He made such a big contribution to football, not least through Leicester City's magical 2016 season that captured the imagination of the world,"" William said in a statement.

""He will be missed by all fans of the sport and everyone lucky enough to have known him.""

The deal signed last month is meant to end a war that began in 2013 and has, according to a London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine study, killed nearly 400,000. 
It commits the warring parties -- forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and rebel groups fighting them -- to power-sharing. Analysts and aid groups say it is unclear how the structure will work. 
Fighting was continuing in the Western Bahr el Ghazal and Central Equatoria regions, said WFP. Nationwide ""tens of thousands of people (are) in need,"" the group's Country Director Adnan Khan told Reuters by e-mail.
WFP singled out Baggari, an area southwest of the city of Wau, in Bahr el Ghazal, where the severity and spread of hunger was alarming. 
""Food distributions were briefly provided in September, after four months without access, but insecurity is again preventing us from accessing the area,"" it said.
When it was able to briefly access Baggari last month, WFP found acute malnutrition rates had risen to above 25 percent from 4 percent earlier this year.
In Wau, government soldiers have been accused by Human Rights Watch of attacking civilians and their homes. 
""Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee into the bush or United Nations protection sites,"" HRW said last week in a report on violence that began in June. ""...Government forces are committing new abuses against civilians.""
Military spokesman Lul Ruai Koang denied the HRW report's findings.
The East African nation gained independence in 2011 but has been torn apart by an ethnically charged civil war since late 2013.

It is unclear if Machar will be there. On Friday a spokesman for his group said: ""We are still waiting for the release of political detainees and prisoners of war"".
Machar was last in South Sudan was in 2016, after he was reinstated vice president under a short-lived peace deal agreed in 2015.

YANGON (Reuters) - Dozens of striking workers from a Chinese-owned garment factory in Myanmar marched to a government compound in the city of Yangon on Monday, demanding to meet the city’s chief minister, as part of efforts to get sacked colleagues reinstated.
Staff from Fu Yuen Ltd factory, on the outskirts of the commercial capital of Yangon, have been demonstrating alongside other labor activists since August, after 30 members of a trade union were fired.
Shouting slogans outside the Yangon regional government compound, about 100 protesters asked to meet Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein, a protégé of Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Kyaw Myo, a labor activist with the All Burma Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters the protesters wanted to discuss their grievance with the minister.
""If we cannot meet him, we'll set up a protest camp,"" he said as workers sat on the pavement nearby.
A representative of Fu Yuen could not be immediately reached for comment.
This month, dozens of workers from Fu Yuen were injured when iron-wielding assailants attacked a crowd gathered outside the factory.
Police blamed the workers for the violence, saying in a statement a fight had broken out after protesters urged employees still working to join them.
Janice Chan, a representative of Fu Yuen, said in an email workers had been hurt while trying to enter the factory and that ""gangsters"" had thrown stones inside it.
Myanmar’s textile industry is its top export earner after oil and gas, employing more than 450,000 people and generating more than $2 billion in exports last year.
Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the sector could soon be at risk as the European Union considers whether to reinstate economic sanctions over the treatment of members of the Rohingya minority, potentially stripping the country of tariff-free access to the trading bloc.
Thet Hter Swe, a worker from the factory, said on Monday the protesters would accept only the reinstatement of the sacked colleagues and could not be bought off with compensation.

“We want to work with dignity, so we only ask to go back to work and to work with full workers’ rights.”

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli cabinet minister's visit to Abu Dhabi's grand mosque gave more momentum on Monday to Israel's diplomatic push in the Gulf, where it sees Arab states as its natural allies against regional powerhouse Iran.
""I am happy that I was privileged to be the first senior official from Israel to sign the mosque's guest book,"" Sports Minister Miri Regev wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) about the tour which she said took place on Sunday.
On Sunday, Regev, in the United Arab Emirates for a judo tournament, fought back tears after Israel's team won gold in the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam - a feat which allowed the Israeli national anthem to be played in a country that does not formally recognize it.
Her attendance at the event and the judo win were portrayed in Israel as both diplomatic and sporting achievements in a region where prospective allies have been reluctant to lift the veil on what Israeli officials have said have been years of covert contacts.
Israel's Communications Minister Ayoob Kara was due in Dubai on Monday to attend the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations agency. 
Shining a rare spotlight on direct ties with Gulf states, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, announced on Friday he had just returned from a surprise visit to Oman, the first time an Israeli leader has visited the Sultanate in 22 years.
Netanyahu has on several occasions hinted at warmer relations with Gulf states.
He told Israel's parliament last week that due to fears of a nuclear threat from Iran, ""Israel and other Arab countries are closer than they ever were before."" 
Israel has diplomatic relations with only two Arab states, neighboring Egypt and Jordan. 
Netanyahu's intensified outreach in the Gulf comes amid heightened speculation in Israel that he could call an early election ahead of polls due no later than November 2019.
Any normalization of relations with Arab states in the Gulf could be a political boost at home, where he has also portrayed tighter ties as a way forward to a broad peace after direct peace talks with the Palestinians that collapsed in 2014.
On Facebook, Regev posted a video that showed her standing inside Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque next to a man who appeared to be Mohamed Bin Thaloob al-Dera, president of the UAE Wrestling Judo & Kickboxing Federation, and another man whom she identified as a mosque official.
The UAE government media office said it could not immediately confirm the identities of the men shown in the tour of the mosque, named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the UAE's first president.
""The essence of the message in this mosque is one of brotherhood and peace,"" Regev, a former chief Israeli military spokeswoman, said in the video, which showed her writing in Hebrew in the guest book.

PAKISJAYA, Indonesia (Reuters) - An Indonesian aircraft with 189 people on board crashed into the sea on Monday as it tried to circle back to the capital, Jakarta, from where it had taken off minutes earlier, and there were likely no survivors, officials said.
Lion Air flight JT610, an almost new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8, was en route to Pangkal Pinang, capital of the Bangka-Belitung tin mining region. Rescue officials said they had recovered some human remains from the crash site, about 15 km (9 miles) off the coast.
(Graphic: Flight path of Indonesia’s Lion Air flight JT610 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OV3w18)
Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, but its safety record is patchy. If all aboard have died, the crash will be the country's second-worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.
The pilot had asked to return to base (RTB) after the plane took off from Jakarta. It lost contact with ground staff after 13 minutes.
""An RTB was requested and had been approved but we're still trying to figure out the reason,"" Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, told reporters, referring to the pilot's request.
""We hope the black box is not far from the main wreckage so it can be found soon,"" he said, referring to the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.
(Graphic: Indonesia plane crash - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OWsv3Z)
Search and rescue agency head Muhmmad Syaugi told a news conference that no distress signal had been received from the aircraft's emergency transmitter.
Yusuf Latief, spokesman of national search and rescue agency, said there were likely no survivors.
At least 23 government officials, four employees of state tin miner PT Timah and three employees of a Timah subsidiary, were on the plane. A Lion Air official said one Italian passenger and one Indian pilot were on board.
Edward Sirait, chief executive of Lion Air Group, told reporters the aircraft had had a technical problem on a flight from the resort island of Bali to Jakarta but it had been ""resolved according to procedure"".
Sirait declined to specify the nature of the issue but said none of its other aircraft of that model had the same problem. Lion had operated 11 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and it had no plan to ground the rest of them, he said.
The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer's workhorse single-aisle jet.
Privately owned Lion Air said the aircraft had been in operation since August, was airworthy, with its pilot and co-pilot together having accumulated 11,000 hours of flying time.
'BE PATIENT'
The plane went down in waters about 30 meters to 35 meters (98 to 115 ft) deep.
Bambang Suryo, operational director of the search and rescue agency, said about 150 rescuers and 40 divers were on the site, using an underwater drone to search for the fuselage, where many of the victims were believed to be trapped.
""We need to find the main wreckage,"" he told reporters.
Another agency official, Deden Ridwansyah, said authorities were focusing on an area about 1 nautical mile in radius based on debris found on the water and floodlights would be used to search through the night.
The flight took off in clear weather at around 6.20 a.m. and was due to have landed in Pangkal Pinang at 7.20 a.m.
Distraught relatives of those on board arrived at the airport in Jakarta and Pangkal Pinang.
""Be patient, pray the best for papa,"" one woman arriving at Jakarta airport told a sobbing girl.
The woman declined to speak to reporters.
President Joko Widodo told a news conference authorities were focusing on the search and rescue, and he called for the country's prayers and support.
Boeing was deeply saddened by the loss, it said in a statement, and was ready to provide technical assistance for the investigation.
Under international rules, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will automatically assist with the inquiry, backed up by technical advisers from Boeing and U.S.-French engine maker CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Data from FlightRadar24 shows the first sign of something amiss was around two minutes into the flight, when the plane had reached 2,000 feet (610 m). 
It descended more than 500 feet (152 m) and veered to the left before climbing again to 5,000 feet (1,524 m), where it stayed during most of the rest of the flight. 
It began gaining speed in the final moments and reached 345 knots (397 mph) before data was lost when it was at 3,650 feet (1,113 m).
Indonesia's worst air disaster was in 1997, when a Garuda Indonesia A300 crashed in the city of Medan, killing 214 people.
Founded in 1999, Lion Air's only fatal accident was in 2004, when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of the 163 on board, the Flight Safety Foundation's Aviation Safety Network says. 

In April, the airline announced a firm order to buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets with a list price of $6.24 billion. It is one of the U.S. planemaker's largest customers globally.

In a joint statement, the two leaders said they would begin regular talks between their foreign and defense ministers and committed to extending cooperation in areas ranging from agriculture and digital technology to investment in Indian rail projects and infrastructure.
Abe and Modi also said they would conclude a $75 billion bilateral currency swap agreement and welcomed an agreement to deepen cooperation between their two navies.
""A strong India benefits Japan and a strong Japan benefits India,"" Abe told reporters after he and Modi signed the statement. 
The talks in Tokyo on Monday followed separate talks on regional issues between the two men the day before at Abe's vacation home near Mount Fuji, the first time he has invited a foreign leader to his private lodge.
India and Japan have drawn closer as China's power in Asia has grown. Tokyo is worried about Chinese activity in the Western Pacific. Delhi wants to keep Beijing influence out of the Indian Ocean. 
In 2015, Japan's Maritime Defence Force became a regular participant in an annual naval exercise, known as Malabar, that the United States and India began in 1992. 
Delhi and Tokyo this month began talks on a military logistics pact, known as a Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA). It would allow Japan to refuel and resupply its ships at Indian naval bases on the Andaman and Nicobar islands near the Malacca Straits, a maritime choke point through which seaborne trade passes on route to ports in China, Japan and elsewhere. 
Japan may also supply the Indian navy with amphibious US-2 aircraft, although the two countries have yet to conclude a deal after five years of negotiations. 
Yet as cooperation between Japan and India grows, Abe is also seeking to improve ties with China. 
Abe last week visited Beijing for talks with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in a bid to ease tensions and forge economic cooperation. 
India and Japan signed a $75 billion bilateral currency swap agreement on Monday, India said, adding the measure was aimed at improving confidence in the foreign exchange and capital markets.
New Delhi said the value of the deal was 50 percent higher than the last currency swap between the two countries, signed in 2014 and effective https://in.reuters.com/article/japan-india-swap-idINDEEA0902D20140110 until December 2015.

RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - Sajed Salameh has spent days waiting at a mass grave in the Syrian city of Raqqa, hoping the bodies of his wife and three children will soon be found so he can give them a proper burial.
They were killed along with his father and two other relatives by an airstrike during the U.S.-backed offensive against Islamic State (IS) and their bodies were buried by the jihadists without his knowledge, he said.
By laying them to rest himself, Salameh said he hopes for ""peace of mind that we buried them in a specific place"". He has already reburied his father, whose body was exhumed from another mass grave.
One year since Islamic State's defeat at Raqqa, the bodies are still being counted as they are pulled from mass graves and from the rubble in the city, which had served as the group's Syrian headquarters.
A team combing the rubble and burial sites has found more than 2,600 bodies so far this year, said Yaser al-Khamis, the team leader. Many more bodies have been recovered by Raqqa residents working on their own, local sources say.
The current focus of Khamis' team is the ""Panorama"" site - formerly a public garden where he said some 800 to 1,500 men, women and children are estimated to have been buried. Some 233 bodies have been exhumed there since work began in October. It is believed to be the biggest of nine mass graves.
Salameh looked on as workmen wearing facemasks pulled one body after another from the trenches, some wrapped in blankets, before putting them in blue bodybags. 
""These are the remains of an unknown man, Panorama, October 16,"" a worker wrote in marker pen on one of the bags.
Khamis said the site comprises 200 trenches, each 30 metres (yards) long. 
Locals say IS prepared the mass graves before the offensive. Some of the bodies belong to militants, Khamis said.
A forensic team stands by to determine the sex, age and cause of death. Those not claimed by relatives are driven away for burial at the city cemetery.
IDENTIFYING THE DEAD
Salameh was not at home when his house in Raqqa's Hisham Ibn Abd al-Malik area was hit on July 13. He said he was busy at the time seeking medical help for himself and the neighbors' children who had been hurt in an air strike beforehand.
The body of Salameh's father was immediately taken away and buried. The others were pulled from the rubble later on and taken to the IS-held hospital, before being buried by the group. 
He hopes to identify his wife and children from the clothes they were wearing at the time they died. ""There are pictures of them before the strike,"" he said.
Salameh now lives in the nearby town of Tabqa with his surviving daughter. He says a total of 22 people were killed in the air strike including neighbors and first responders.
The fall of Raqqa was a big victory in the war against IS.
But Amnesty International has accused the coalition of failing to admit or adequately investigate ""the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction it caused in Raqqa"", where IS used civilians as human shields.
The coalition spokesman said the number of civilians so far confirmed as having been killed by accident in the campaign was 104, but he did not rule out that it may go higher. ""If there is an allegation of a civilian casualty, we check it against our existing records,"" Colonel Sean Ryan told Reuters. 
Amnesty's senior director of global research said this month the majority of some 2,500 bodies unearthed in Raqqa were believed to be civilians who died in air strikes.

The coalition has said its operations have used deliberate targeting to minimize the impact on civilians.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey called on Monday for the full truth surrounding the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi to be revealed, as Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor held talks in Istanbul.
Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul nearly four weeks ago has escalated into a crisis for the world's top oil exporter, which initially denied any knowledge of or role in his death.
Saudi public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb arrived in Istanbul overnight, days after he contradicted weeks of Saudi statements by saying that Khashoggi's killing was premeditated. On Monday he met Istanbul's chief prosecutor.
""The whole truth must be revealed,"" Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference. ""We believe this visit is important for these truths to come out.""
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed inside the consulate after he went there to get documents for his forthcoming marriage.
Saudi officials initially insisted that Khashoggi left the compound on Oct. 2 after completing his paperwork. Turkish officials, however, said they believed he was killed inside by a team sent from Saudi Arabia. 
Riyadh's numerous shifting accounts of the killing have undermined Prince Mohammed's standing in the West.
Cavusoglu called on Riyadh to conclude the investigation as soon as possible.
Turkey's state broadcaster TRT Haber said Saudi officials at Monday's meeting asked for the whole investigation folder, including evidence, statements and footage, be given to them. TRT said the Saudi request was denied.
Turkish prosecutors at the meeting, which lasted slightly over an hour, repeated Ankara's request that 18 suspects be brought to Turkey and that the location of Khashoggi's body be revealed, it said.
Turkey's Anadolu news agency said Mojeb was expected to inspect the Saudi consulate.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has expressed scepticism about Saudi's changing explanations of the killing and has called on the kingdom to hold to account all those responsible, no matter how highly placed.
The suspects Turkey wants extradited include a 15-man security team that it says flew in hours before the killing and carried it out. Erdogan said on Saturday the extradition request was being relayed to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said those behind the killing would be prosecuted in the kingdom.

Turkey has said it shared information regarding the investigation with other countries, including the United States, Germany, France and Russia.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",A Trump-Bolsonaro bromance could be brewing after Brazilian's big win,"By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - He has vowed to drain the swamp, slash regulations and get tough with China. Evangelicals and gun-rights advocates love him. He has denounced the media as ""fake news."" Political foes? Lock 'em up.
Brazil's new president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, is an ardent admirer — and shrewd imitator — of his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump. And that could usher in one of the warmest bilateral relationships in the Western Hemisphere.
Trump called to congratulate Bolsonaro on Sunday night, shortly after the far-right congressman scored a resounding victory at the polls, winning 55 percent of the vote following a mud-slinging campaign with a leftist rival.
Bolsonaro and Trump spoke of ""a strong commitment to work side-by-side"" on issues affecting Brazil, the United States and beyond, the White House said.
Trump has bullied and wrangled with other leaders in the Americas, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. 
But in Bolsonaro, Trump will find a doppelganger whose world view and pugnacious style are strikingly similar to his own.
""Just like he wants to make America great, I want to make Brazil great,"" Bolsonaro, a former army captain, said in a televised interview in July.
The 63-year-old ran as an outsider bent on smashing what he sees as a corrupt and hidebound political system that has forgotten ordinary citizens. His fiery rhetoric and slurs against gays, women and minorities have thrilled followers who view him as an authentic straight shooter. He has championed law and order, patriotism and religious values. And he has demonized his leftist detractors as enemies of the people.
While many world leaders have held Trump at arm's length, Bolsonaro has made no secret of his esteem. He has praised America's 45th president as a gutsy, decisive commander who has prevailed in the face of unfair criticism.
""Trump faced the same attacks I am facing - that he was a homophobe, a fascist, a racist, a Nazi,"" Bolsonaro told Reuters last year before his candidacy caught fire. ""But the people believed in his platform. I was rooting for him.""
Such blandishments are likely to play well with Trump, who has shown an affinity for authoritarian leaders, particularly those who flatter and cajole him.
Christopher Garman, chief Americas analyst for the New York-based political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said a new cross-hemisphere bromance could be in the offing.
""(Bolsonaro's) win will surely herald a stronger bilateral relationship,"" Garman said. ""Bolsonaro not only is a self-professed fan of Donald Trump, but both were elected on a wave of anti-establishment anger with relatively similar ideological proclivities.""The White House is likely to respond well, and Donald Trump has already shown he values personal relationships with foreign leaders,"" Garman said.
MOVING CLOSER
Bolsonaro has already signaled his plan to shift Brazilian foreign policy hard to the right, a development that would play well with the Trump administration.
He has said he will move Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following the lead of the United States. And similar to Trump, Bolsonaro is rethinking his country's membership in multinational organizations and treaties that he thinks might not be in Brazil's best interest, including the Mercosur trade bloc, the BRICS group of large emerging economies and the Paris climate accord.
Those changes would reverse 13 years' worth of diplomacy crafted by governments led by the country's leftist Workers Party, which focused on alliances with Brazil's South American neighbors and other developing powers. 
Bolsonaro is also questioning Brazil's relationship with China, which he views as a predatory economic partner. The Asian giant is Brazil's biggest foreign buyer of soybeans, iron ore and other commodities. But Bolsonaro is alarmed at a spate of Chinese purchases of Brazilian energy and infrastructure companies.
""The Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil,"" Bolsonaro has warned repeatedly.
Such talk is likely to please Trump, whose tariffs on Chinese goods have ignited a trade war that has much of the world blaming the United States for disrupting global supply chains and rattling markets worldwide.
So, too, is Bolsonaro's plan to privatize a string of Brazil's state-owned companies and loosen environmental restrictions to make way for more mining, ranching and farming.
Still, trade is likely to remain a sore point between the United States and Brazil, whose steep tariffs on imported goods make it one of the most closed economies in the world. 
Trump singled out Brazil this month in a rant about tariffs.
""They charge us whatever they want,"" he said in remarks to reporters at a White House event. ""If you ask some of the companies, they say Brazil is among the toughest in the world - maybe the toughest in the world.""
Even if trade issues remain thorny, Bolsonaro's gaze is directed north. He is an avid supporter of the National Rifle Association and vows that once he takes office on January 1, he will roll back Brazil's strict gun laws and let citizens take up arms to defend themselves from criminals. 
Like Trump, Bolsonaro masterfully tapped into voters' fears and frustrations to rocket to the presidency. Brazil is beset by appalling levels of street crime. In the past few years, a sprawling corruption investigation has revealed epic levels of corruption at the highest levels of government. 
One former president is in jail and another was impeached and tossed from office. The economy was hit by the worst downturn in decades and has yet to regain its luster; more than 13 million Brazilians are unemployed.
Hungry for change, voters responded to Bolsonaro's bold promises to crack heads and clean up the mess.
Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said he sees echoes of his old boss, who rode a similar wave of discontent.

""It takes those types of crises, and Brazil is going through that type of crisis now,"" Bannon told Reuters recently. ""I think that Bolsonaro, he's a figure like Trump.""

Islamic State (IS) launched the assault against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the Deir al-Zor region near the Iraqi border on Friday. Iraqi Shi'ite militias have reinforced their side of the frontier in response.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said around 70 SDF fighters were killed in the assault which Islamic State launched under cover of a sandstorm and drew on suicide bombers and female jihadists. The SDF says it lost 14 fighters.
A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said Islamic State had been able to regain some ground but the SDF would ""come back with coalition support"".
An SDF commander attributed the setback partly to the relative inexperience of the Arab SDF forces which have carried out much of the fighting against hardened Islamic State militants in Deir al-Zor.
While the Arab fighters of the Deir al-Zor Military Council had been able to make advances to a ""certain level"", Islamic State is resisting even more fiercely as the offensive closes in on its last pockets.
This required the deployment of special forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which spearheads the SDF, and its female affiliate the YPJ.
""We were forced to draw on experienced fighters from the YPG and YPJ,"" the commander said. ""They will be relied on to complete the campaign,"" the commander said. 
The fighting is the latest phase of efforts by the U.S.-led coalition and the SDF to clear Islamic State from its last footholds east of the Euphrates River following last year's defeat of the group in Raqqa, its Syrian headquarters.
""This battle is give and take sometimes like most military fights and we have been saying from the beginning, this will be a difficult struggle,"" Colonel Sean Ryan, the coalition's spokesman, said in an email to Reuters.
""ISIS is using experienced foreign fighters with nothing to lose and the SDF will come back with coalition support and continue to degrade and destroy ISIS,"" he added.
Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella group that includes mostly Shi'ite militias, said on Saturday it was reinforcing at the Syrian border, including with missile batteries, after the SDF was pushed back by IS.
""There are orders to close the Baghouz crossing,"" it said, which lies at the Euphrates river between Albu Kamal in Syria and al-Qaim in Iraq, both IS strongholds during the group's rule.
An Iraqi military spokesman confirmed the PMF, which were formally absorbed into the security forces earlier this year, had reinforced on the border.
He said the army and border guard would coordinate with the PMF if IS militants tried to get into Iraqi territory.
""We have units behind the border, including artillery, ready to deal with any attempts by terrorist elements to infiltrate ... there is also aerial surveillance,"" Brigadier General Yehia Rasool said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments began discussions on Monday to assess whether and when to scrap the twice-yearly clock change, amid doubts the requirement would be dropped in 2019 as the EU executive has proposed.
Last month, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced a plan to stop changing Europe's clocks next year, after millions of people responded to a survey by calling for the decades-old practice to end.
Norbert Hofer, transport minister of Austria, whose country holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, told reporters on Monday that 2019 was too soon for most.
""We will need to find a compromise as some countries, actually most, have reservations about changing the system in 2019,"" he said before a meeting of fellow transport ministers in Graz, Austria, a day after clocks went back an hour for winter.
Many countries had referred to an array of technical issues to solve, adding that the airline industry for one had said it needed 18 months to prepare, he said. Monday's meeting was a first informal discussion with no decision due. The transport ministers' next formal meeting is on Dec. 3.
The Commission had wanted each EU government to decide by April which time zone they want to be in permanently -- whether in October 2019 they want to stay in summer time year-round or turn their clocks back one last time to permanent winter time. 
Hofer said Austria agreed that the switch should take place, given studies showing clock changes had a negative effect on people and animals and that they did not meet their original goal of saving energy.
""It has not brought us anything. It was an idea from the 1970s, the time of the oil crisis, and now is the time to end this measure,"" he said. ""The majority (of countries) supports this goal. There are some countries that are skeptical.""
Danish Transport Minister Ole Birk Olesen said there needed to be a full public debate on the issue, which had not yet happened in Denmark, and it was not realistic to scrap clock changes next year.
Luxembourg, where nearly half the local workforce actually lives in Belgium, France or Germany, urged a continued harmonized system, its minister saying it would be ""catastrophic"" if those countries were on different time zones.

Even in countries where there was a consensus to scrap clock changes, there was not necessarily agreement on whether to pick summer or winter time. Estonian minister Kadri Simson said there would be ""heated debate"" over which time to pick.

Set to run from Nov. 5 to Nov. 10, the China International Import Expo will bring together thousands of foreign and Chinese companies, aiming to boost imports, allay foreign concern about China's trade practices and show readiness to narrow trade gaps.
But the United States does not plan to send senior government officials to the fair, a U.S. embassy spokesman said last week. China said that the decision was ""hard to understand"". 
The two countries are locked in a bitter trade war.
China's Foreign Ministry said leaders would be coming from the Czech Republic, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Kenya, Lithuania, Panama, El Salvador, Switzerland, the Cook Islands, Croatia, Egypt, Hungary, Georgia, Laos, Malta, Pakistan, Russia and Vietnam.
El Salvador and the Dominican Republic both switched recognition from Taiwan to China this year.
Some are sending presidents, including the Czech Republic and Kenya, while others, such as Russia and Pakistan, are sending their prime ministers.
Asked why certain countries' leaders had been invited specifically, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said everyone was very enthusiastic about attending the trade fair, but as to who represents which country was up to the countries to decide after ""friendly consultations"" with China.
""Certainly, it has received broad attention and has been broadly welcomed by the international community,"" he said.
China holding an import fair shows the Chinese government's determination to further open up the country and to share the benefits of China's development, Lu added.
China says more 130 countries and 2,800 companies have decided to take part, including 180 U.S. companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Disney and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the import expo in early 2017 and will speak at its opening.

However, some critics have dismissed the event, which China plans to hold every year, as largely a propaganda effort.

The Equanimity is among $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought by fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, and his associates with funds taken from 1MDB, the U.S. Department of Justice has said.
Malaysia and the United States are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), with some of the money used to buy a private jet, Picasso paintings, jewelry, real estate and a superyacht.
A Malaysian court in August approved the sale of the 300-ft (91 m) Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity, which was impounded months earlier near the Indonesian island of Bali and handed over to Malaysia.
The Equanimity, which according to U.S. court documents was bought by Low for $250 million, has been appraised for the auction. But its estimated value will only be disclosed after the bidding process ends on Nov. 28, said Jeremy Joseph, a lawyer for 1MDB and the government. 
""If the highest bid matches or exceeds the appraised value, then it can be accepted by the court,"" Joseph told Reuters. 
The proceeds will be held by the court for 90 days to allow time for any potential claimants to come forward, he said. 
A representative for Equanimity (Cayman) Ltd, a company which claims ownership of the yacht, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The firm said in August that Malaysia's move to sell the yacht was a violation of due process and international law.
Malaysian police have issued an arrest warrant and filed criminal charges against Low, but his whereabouts are unknown.
A representative for Low, who has maintained his innocence, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.
Low said through a spokesman in August that the seizure and planned sale of the yacht was ""illegal and costly.""
The Equanimity's interior was designed ""using a variety of exotic materials,"" according to a website listing by Burgess, a yacht brokerage appointed to oversee the bidding process. 

The vessel can accommodate up to 22 guests and 31 crew, with amenities that include a swimming pool, a beauty salon, a massage room and sauna, medical facilities and a helicopter pad, the listing said.

ASEAN and China this year started formal negotiations for a code of conduct to ease tensions brought by conflicting claims over a strategic waterway where about $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods passes every year.
""Perhaps we will not be able to arrive at a legally binding code of conduct,"" Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin told a news conference in southern Davao City after holding talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
""But, it will be the standard on how people of ASEAN, governments of ASEAN will behave toward each other - always with honor, never with aggression and always for the mutual progress.""
Locsin did not elaborate his statement on why raised doubts a binding agreement will be reached.
China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, has put up artificial islands turning them into garrisons. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the rich fishing grounds.
Australia, Japan and the United States have urged ASEAN and China to ensure the code is ""legally binding"", while critics have said failure to make it enforceable creates doubts about how effective it can be.
China's top diplomat assured ASEAN it will abide by whatever will be agreed in ongoing negotiations.

The 28-year-old princess, the third daughter of Emperor Akihito's late cousin Prince Takamado, tied the knot with Kei Moriya, a 32-year-old employee of shipping company Nippon Yusen.
The princess wore a many-layered court kimono and molded hairdo typical of the imperial aristocracy, while the groom wore a black tuxedo with grey trousers for the ceremony at the shrine dedicated to the spirit of her great-grandfather, Emperor Meiji.
""I'm filled with joy to get married and to have so many people visit us at the Meiji Shrine and congratulate us,” Princess Ayako told a news conference after the private Shinto wedding ceremony. 
Japanese royals have been given freedom to marry whom they choose for at least three generations. Emperor Akihito was the first crown prince to marry a commoner, who became Empress Michiko. They met on the tennis court.
Princess Ayako had to renounce her imperial status because she married a commoner, as is the practice for women under Japan's succession law. She will become Ayako Moriya after signing marriage papers later Monday.
Japan's royal family is experiencing a shortage of males. Crown Prince Naruhito, who takes over after Akihito abdicates next year, his brother Fumihito, his nephew Hisahito and Masahito, the octogenarian brother of the current emperor, are the only four male heirs to the throne left. 
The shrinking royal family has raised concerns and calls for changes in the Imperial Succession Law, but conservatives are deeply resistant to allowing females to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel faced calls on Monday from her own conservatives to cede the party's leadership, further eroding her authority after painful losses in a regional election.
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) came home first in Sunday's election in the western state of Hesse but support fell by more than 11 points, reigniting a succession debate by conservatives unhappy with the chancellor's grip on power.
She will also have to contend with pressure from her Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners, who have also bled support in Hesse and are under pressure to rethink their alliance with Merkel.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles, whose party saw support fall to its lowest since 1946, has threatened to end the alliance with Merkel's conservatives if there is no improvement on policy.
Merkel, chancellor for 13 years, will have to invest her political capital and tactical acumen to keep together her loveless coalition, borne out of necessity seven months ago after an inconclusive federal election last year.
This will distract her from tending to major challenges at home and abroad - ranging from overcoming a digital deficit and pushing the German car industry toward cleaner mobility to seeing through euro zone reforms and managing Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
""The election results show that people expect renewal from the CDU,"" conservative lawmaker Matern von Marschall told the Stuttgarter newspaper.
His CDU colleague Christian von Steffen was more blunt: ""We need a meaningful program with a clear path and new faces.""
A senior CDU member told Reuters that party leaders wanted to discuss the possibility of Merkel reversing her decision to seek re-election as party chairwoman in December.
""This should be discussed,"" the member of the CDU governing board told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. CDU leaders will meet next Sunday to prepare for a summit in December where party members will vote for a new chairman.
Nahles is also feeling the heat from SPD members still disgruntled with their leaders' decision to join Merkel instead of fulfilling an election promise to sit in opposition if they fail to win the federal vote.
Nahles said on Sunday she would propose a roadmap to allow the SPD to measure the progress of the ruling coalition, which has been plagued by infighting, at a mid-term review next year.
Her proposal did little to appease the head of the SPD's youth wing, who said the election in Hesse was a clear signal that the ruling coalition was not viable.
""The final verdict on the coalition has been spoken,"" Kevin Kuehnert wrote in Twitter. ""Voters don't want 'business as usual.'""
Merkel's coalition was twice on the brink of collapse, once over immigration policy and then over a dispute about the fate of the domestic intelligence chief who was accused of harboring far-right views.
The instability has further eroded the credibility of the conservatives and the SPD in the eyes of German voters, who are increasingly turning to smaller parties on the right and on the left.
In Hesse, where Merkel's CDU rule with the ecologist Greens, the two biggest winners were the Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan braved the rain on a New Zealand beach on Monday for an encounter with a ""cheeky"" native bird in the picturesque Abel Tasman national park during the final leg of their Pacific tour. 
The pair spent their second day in New Zealand on the northern tip of the nation's South Island, having taken a short helicopter flight from Wellington, the capital, where they arrived on Sunday following visits to Australia, Fiji and Tonga.
At a beachside campsite, the local iwi, or tribe, welcomed Harry and Meghan with a traditional ceremony accompanied by the blowing of a conch shell. The couple pressed noses with a long line of people in a greeting known as a 'hongi'. 
Inside a marquee set up on the grass, Meghan smiled as elder Barney Thomas addressed the couple in the Te Reo Maori language, wishing them ""kia kaha"", or strength, for the baby she is expecting next year. 
Harry struck an upbeat tone despite the drizzly weather, which canceled a tree-planting ceremony. The pair stayed inside the dry marquee for tea and cake with school children.
""From my wife, myself and our little bump, it's a blessing to be here,"" said Harry. ""The weather forecast was a lot worse than this and we are really fortunate to be here. The rain is a blessing and a reminder of our connection to the land."" 
The pair took a stroll on the nearby golden-sand beach, with Harry wearing a black puffer jacket and Meghan in a black Seasalt coat. 
They came across a weka, a small flightless native bird that ranger Andrew Lamason told the couple is New Zealand's version of a monkey due to its ""cheeky"" nature. 
Saskia Gray, a 16-year-old youth ambassador, said she was impressed by the couple. ""They acted very down-to-earth, and they genuinely care about the people and the land,"" she said.
The royal pair had spent the morning in Wellington discussing mental health issues with members of support groups at a beachside cafe. On Sunday evening, they attended an event to mark the 125th anniversary of women winning the right to vote in New Zealand.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that she had discussed issues related to the Pacific and climate change with the couple on Sunday. 

Ardern gave Meghan earrings designed by a local artist in the shape of two feathers, while Harry received an album by New Zealand drum and bass band Shapeshifter.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans voted to scrap a part-built $13 billion new airport for the capital in a divisive referendum pushed for by President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, dealing a blow to business leaders like Carlos Slim, and causing the peso to slide.
Roughly a million people, just 1 percent of Mexico's electorate, participated in the referendum held over four days, the Arturo Rosenblueth Foundation, the non-profit organization that supervised the count, said after voting ended on Sunday.
Almost 70 percent voted against the new airport, it said.
Called a ""public consultation"", the vote was non-binding, but the leftist Lopez Obrador, who had called for the referendum and was against the new airport, has pledged to respect the result.
The peso weakened some 2 percent against the dollar after the results were announced, making it by far the biggest loser among major currencies against the dollar.
The public was asked if the next government should finish the new airport to replace the current hub, or add two runways to convert a military air base in Santa Lucia, around 50 km (31 miles) north of the capital, and keep the current airport.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, argued during the election campaign that the new airport was tainted by corruption and would be expensive to maintain due to the geological complexity of the terrain. It has been under construction on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco east of Mexico City since 2015.
Companies owned by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, once the world's richest man, were co-designing, co-financing, and co-building the Texcoco project. Mexico's pension funds had also put up money.
In a statement on Sunday in English, Lopez Obrador's transition team said the incoming government would not allocate new resources to the Texcoco project, but that the rights of investors and bondholders were fully guaranteed.
Designated transport minister Javier Jimenez has canvassed to convert the air base at Santa Lucia.
Still, Gustavo de Hoyos, head of employers' confederation Coparmex, urged Lopez Obrador to finish the Texcoco project, one of the flagship public works of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto of the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Cancelling the new airport would cost about 120 billion pesos, the Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de México (GACM), which has been handling the project, said earlier this year. 
CRYING FOUL
The public vote was organized by Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), without the national electoral authority INE. Opposition parties say that the consultation did not follow the proper rules.
Several local media outlets reported cases of people who were able to vote more than once, and highlighted failures in software used to register voter identification cards.
On Twitter, the PRI accused the incoming government of rigging the vote in favor of Santa Lucia.
Javier Lozano, a former labor minister and backer of the defeated PRI candidate in the presidential election, described the vote to cancel the airport as ""terrible news"".
""We look like a banana republic to the world,"" he said in a televised discussion of the decision on broadcaster Televisa.
MORENA lawmakers sought to cast the vote as a referendum on the business ties of the PRI government, whose credibility was battered by allegations of corruption and conflicts-of-interest.
""The markets have our respect, but this decision was for the people to make,"" Marti Batres, the leader of the Senate and a senior member of MORENA, told the Televisa discussion.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 02:55AM ET</span>",Pasta and petrol: smuggling crackdown stirs dissent in Tunisia's south,"By Ulf Laessing
REMADA, Tunisia (Reuters) - Tunisian Zubair Abdel-Moula lost his work selling smuggled fuel on the streets of a poor southern town after the government tightened controls with Libya to stop militants crossing the 460km (286 miles) border.
The 32-year-old, who has never had a full-time job, now sits on a mattress blocking traffic in Remada's main street with other unemployed protestors, demanding state jobs and aid. 
Tunisia started digging trenches and setting up monitoring systems provided by Western allies on the Libyan border in 2015.
Routes that had been used for decades to smuggle cheap fuel, pasta and wheat from Libya to Tunisia, were also being used by Islamic militants and to transport drugs and arms.
Officials say shutting the routes has helped prevent a repeat of attacks such as the one in 2015 when a Libyan-trained Tunisian shot dead dozens of tourists on a Tunisian beach. 
But the crackdown took the livelihood of thousands, many of whom have joined the protests. The growing dissent is a worry for the government, the ninth since the Arab Spring and the 2011 fall of leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, as it clings to power. 
""We won't go,"" said Abdel-Moula. ""I don't hope of things getting better.""
Southern Tunisia sits on the oil and phosphate that drive the overall economy but the good jobs in those sectors rarely go to locals who often lack engineering skills. The area around Remada is poorer than the capital Tunis, 600 km to the north.
""The south provides everything for Tunisia. There are foreign companies making money here but we locals can't get jobs at oilfields."" said Abdel-Moula.
Fellow protestor Abdullah used to spend his nights in remote borderlands buying fuel from Libyan truck drivers to sell in Remada. Due to subsidies, the pump price of petrol in Libya is ten times cheaper than in Tunisia.
With the crackdown, the work has become too dangerous. 
""I used to have a fuel (distribution) station with seven other families to buy (Libyan) fuel but it has become too dangerous,"" said Abdullah, asking not to use his full name. 
UNEMPLOYMENT 
Western countries have praised Tunisia as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring. It transitioned to democracy after toppling long-serving leader Ben-Ali without triggering widespread violence or civil war.
It has held free elections and in 2014 approved a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights in contrast to autocratic systems and turmoil elsewhere in region.
But the succession of governments since Ben Ali's overthrow has been unable to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed is fighting for survival with his coalition locked in a row about how to reform the economy.
Investors have been scared away from North Africa by turmoil in Libya, inflation hit 7.4 percent in September, the highest since 1990, and the jobless rate is 15 percent. 
In the southern province of Tataouine, which includes Remada and much of the Libyan border, unemployment is 32 percent.
""We have a problem with unemployment,"" said Governor Adel Ouerghi. ""Most of our youth want to work (on oilfields) in the desert because salaries are high there.""
Many Tunisians used to cross the border to work in Libya but now feel the country is too dangerous.
""If the situation was stable 300,000 to 400,000 could find work there,"" he said.
Tunisia tolerated the smuggling for decades as a way to help the south which missed out on industries concentrated mostly in the north and eastern coast.
Some 3,000 Tunisians have joined Islamic State and other extremists in Libya, Syria and Iraq, many of which came from the south or equally neglected central hinterland. 
But the chaos in Libya led to a spike in arrivals of militants, drugs and weapons, diplomats say, forcing the government to act. 
Libya's state oil firm, NOC, was also keen for a crackdown. It estimates the smuggling cost the economy at least $750 million each year.
""We think most of the fuel goes to Tunisia and to Europe via Malta,"" NOC said in a statement. ""Some local economies have become oriented around smuggling and this affects the fabric of communities who become dependent on criminal activity.""
The smuggling has also caused fuel shortages in some Libyan towns, officials say. 
""It has been also agreed with other towns and tribes to disassociate all those involved in smuggling,"" said Mustafa al-Barouni, mayor of Zintan, a western Libyan town.
ESCALATION
Tunisian officials say it will be impossible to stop smuggling completely. 
The border can't be sealed in mountain regions and some Tunisian guards, often related to smugglers, look the other way for a bribe, residents say.
Fuel stalls seen by Reuters on the road between Remada and the provincial capital Tataouine were abandoned but some youths were still selling gasoline, even on the same street as the governor's office. 
But for the protesters too many people have lost their livelihood. 
""Thousands of families depend on this,"" said Salem Bounhas, secretary general of the powerful labor union UGTT in Tataouine. 
The protestors have threatened to escalate road blocks to cut off access to oil refineries unless the government finds them other work.
The government has focused too much on closing borders without dealing with unemployment, said Chloe Teevan, a North Africa researcher at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

""Such policies are contributing to the rising disillusionment that has followed the revolution.""

380,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 02:37AM ET</span>",Red Sox beat Dodgers in Game Five to win World Series,"By Rory Carroll
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Steve Pearce slammed a pair of home runs and David Price tossed a seven-inning gem to power the Boston Red Sox to a 5-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers and their fourth World Series title in 15 years on Sunday.
The Red Sox, after winning a franchise record and Major League Baseball best 108 games during the regular season, carried their domination all the way to the World Series and overwhelmed the Dodgers 4-1 in the best-of-seven series.
The Red Sox clinched their ninth World Series title with a lethal combination of power and pitching.
Game Five starter Price surrendered one run on three hits in seven plus innings to collect his third straight postseason win, while all the Red Sox runs were scored via home runs.
Pearce, who was named the World Series most valuable player, gave Boston a 2-0 lead they would never relinquish with a two-run blast in the first and added a solo shot in the eighth. Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez hit solo home runs.
Price said winning the World Series was the whole reason he came to Boston.
""Seeing all these grown men over there just acting like little kids, that's what it's all about,"" he added. ""To come out on top the way we did is unreal.
""This is why I came to Boston. I know it is a tough place to play.""
His two stellar World Series starts, where he dominated the Dodgers lineup, also put to rest any questions about his ability to perform in the postseason.
""It was tough, absolutely, to answer that question in Spring Training day after day, over and over and over and over, anytime it got to September, playoffs,"" the veteran left-hander told reporters.
""I hold all the cards now. And that feels so good.""
FUNNY GAME
The Dodgers and their fans arrived at Chavez Ravine on Sunday knowing only 13 teams had clawed their way back from 3-1 deficits to win a best-of-seven postseason series.
The last to do it was the Chicago Cubs against the Cleveland Indians in 2016 as they claimed their first World Series crown in 108 years.
Backed into a corner and with their bullpen worn out, the Dodgers turned to three-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw, while the Red Sox countered with their Cy Young winner Price.
The chances of a Fall Classic pitchers duel seemed unlikely when both starters were clobbered for first-inning home runs.
After Andrew Binitendi singled, Pearce took the first pitch he saw from Kershaw and launched into the center field bleachers for a 2-0 lead.
""Baseball is a funny game, great things can happen and I am very blessed to be here right now,"" said Pearce, who has played for every team in the American League East.
""This is the best feeling in my life. This is what you grow up wishing that you could be a part of, something like this. With that special group of guys out there, to celebrate with them, that was awesome.""
The Dodgers, who were beaten by the Houston Astros in last season's World Series, hit back right away when David Freese crushed a leadoff homer to get Los Angeles on the scoreboard.
The first-inning fireworks gave way to the pitching battle many had predicted with Price and Kershaw settling down and tossing four shutout innings.
Boston seized control in the sixth when Betts, in an 0-13 slump at the plate, smashed a solo shot while Martinez connected for a leadoff homer in the seventh.
Kershaw, who has never lived up to his Cy Young credentials in the postseason, endured another rough outing and gave up four runs on seven hits in seven innings of work.
""There's only one team that can win and we know that but it just hurts worse when you make it all the way and get second place,"" said Kershaw, whose future with the Dodgers is in doubt.
""So having done that two years in a row now, it doesn't make it any easier.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - The top U.S. envoy for North Korea sought to inject momentum to nuclear talks with Pyongyang, saying he is ""absolutely certain"" Washington and Seoul can work together to achieve their objective of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
U.S. Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, was in Seoul to meet with senior South Korean officials, including his counterpart Lee Do-hoon.
""We have a shared goal here, which is to bring an end to 70 years of war and hostilities on the Korean peninsula,"" Biegun told Lee at the start of their meeting. 
""And the primary requirement for us to get to the end point is to achieve final, fully, verified denuclearization of North Korea… I am absolutely certain we can do this together.""
Over recent weeks, the administration of South Korea's Moon Jae-in has forged ahead with efforts to engage with the North, stoking U.S. concern over a range of issues, from sanctions enforcement to plans for a no-fly zone between the two Koreas.
Lee said that Washington and Seoul are working to ensure that both countries engage North Korea with a united front. 
""Because the denuclearization process is at a critical juncture we need to meet up as often as possible to make sure there is no daylight whatsoever between our two allies,"" Lee said.
While Biegun is not scheduled to visit the North, he said he was eager to begin ""working-level negotiations"" with the reclusive state as soon as possible.
He said early this month that he had offered to meet his North Korean counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearization during an unprecedented June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, but the North's actions have failed to satisfy U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and material.
The United States suspended some of its annual military drills with South Korea, but has been wary of providing Pyongyang big economic benefits until it takes further concrete disarmament steps.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in North Korea earlier this month, said he was coordinating with allies for a second summit between Trump and Kim though there have been little detail about any breakthrough since then.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Global pressure rises on Sri Lanka president to defuse political crisis,"By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena is under increasing pressure to uphold the island nation's constitution and reconvene parliament after his decision to replace the prime minister triggered political turmoil. 
Sri Lanka was plunged into the crisis on Friday when Sirisena sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and swore in ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa to replace him, breaking up a fragile coalition governing the island.
Wickremesinghe says his sacking was illegal and unconstitutional and maintains he is still prime minister, leading to a standoff between his party and labour unions loyal to Sirisena. 
On Sunday, Arjuna Ranatunga, petroleum minister in the ousted cabinet, tried to re-enter his office, leading to clashes in which one person was killed and two were injured.
The crisis has important ramifications in a battle for influence in south Asia between Sri Lanka's traditional ally India and China, a country that is playing an increasing role in the region. 
China, long seen as a supporter of Rajapaksa, has already congratulated him on becoming prime minister. 
But India, the European Union and the United States have all urged Sirisena to abide by the constitution. 
""We call on the president, in consultation with the speaker, to immediately reconvene parliament and allow the democratically elected representatives of the Sri Lankan people to fulfil their responsibilities to affirm who will lead their government,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
Sources in diplomatic missions said most foreign envoys had yet to send congratulatory messages to Rajapaksa as it could be interpreted as legitimizing the new government while there were still complaints his appointment was unconstitutional. 
MARKET FALLOUT
The political turmoil comes at a critical time for a Sri Lankan economy struggling with slow growth and a weakening currency. 
If tensions continue, Sri Lanka could struggle to refinance government debt that comes due in early 2019 at an affordable rate, credit rating agency Moody's said.
The country's bonds sold off on Monday, while the Sri Lankan rupee fell 0.58 percent to an all-time low. 
""The president’s sudden appointment of Mr Rajapaksa as prime minister significantly heightens policy uncertainty,"" said Matthew Circosta, an analyst at Moody's Sovereign Risk Group 
""Additionally, the possible social tensions that may unfold in the next few weeks would have a negative impact on the economy, which is already growing slowly."" 
India and western countries have previously expressed concern about Rajapaksa's ties to China, after he ushered in billions of dollars of investment from Beijing to rebuild the country following the end of a 26-year war against ethnic Tamil separatists in 2009.
That investment has since put Sri Lanka deep in debt and forced it to hand over control of a strategic port to China.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Philippines issues storm warnings ahead of destructive typhoon Yutu,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines raised tropical cyclone warnings levels for nine provinces and put a mountainous region on high alert for possible landslides on Monday ahead of a typhoon that threatened storm surges and floods triggered by heavy winds and rain.
Typhoon Yutu, which caused havoc last week with a direct hit on the U.S. Northern Mariana islands, was set to make landfall on Tuesday morning and move across the main island of Luzon before exiting the Philippines 24 hours later, the state weather agency PAGASA said.
Yutu was a category 3 storm on Monday, with sustained winds reaching 170 km per hour (106 mph) and gusts of up to 210 kph.
That was less intense than four days ago, when as a super typhoon it barrelled through the Marianas, a U.S. Western Pacific archipelago of 52,000 people, tearing off roofs, overturning vehicles and cutting off power and water.
Nine provinces in north Luzon were elevated to warning signal 2 on the severity scale of 5, and 20 more were put on the earliest warning of 1, with strong winds and rains expected later on Monday. The mountainous Cordillera region was put on red alert for landslides.
Known locally as Rosita, the typhoon will be the 18th to hit the Philippines this year and comes six weeks after super typhoon Mangkhut tore across Luzon, triggering landslides that killed dozens of people and damaged about $180 million of crops.
Classes were suspended in at least five provinces and fishermen in Luzon and the eastern seaboard advised not to go to sea. All boat services in the port city of Batangas, about 83 km (52 miles) south of Manila, were suspended on Monday.
About half of the Philippines' 105 million population live in the Luzon region. The country is hit by an average 20 typhoons each year.

384,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Britain's Hammond to turn up heat on Brexit rebels in budget speech,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond will use his annual budget speech on Monday to urge his divided Conservative Party to get behind the government's push for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity.
Hammond, who routinely angers many Conservative lawmakers by calling for close ties with the European Union after Brexit, will offer a glimpse of higher spending after nearly a decade of cuts to many public services.
But he will also say that an easing of the spending squeeze will hinge on London reaching an agreement with Brussels to smooth Britain's exit from the EU in five months' time.
""If we don't get a deal ... we would need to take a different approach to the future of Britain's economy,"" Hammond told Sky News television on Sunday.
""We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we'd need to have a new budget that set out a different strategy for the future."" 
Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to rally the Conservatives behind her Brexit strategy, raising concerns that Britain could leave the EU in March without a transition deal.
Hammond could soften an immediate shock to the economy by spending some of the reserves he has built up within the limits of his fiscal rules. 
But a no-deal Brexit would probably cut Britain's annual growth rate to just 0.3 percent next year and in 2020 and push up borrowing, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, said last week.
Britain's economy has slowed since the 2016 Brexit referendum but not as much as many economists feared, allowing Hammond to announce on Monday a further improvement in the budget deficit.
Still, Britain's debt levels remain high, limiting how much Hammond can relax his spending squeeze.
He said on Sunday that the biggest increase in spending in his budget had already been announced when May said four months ago that more money would go to the health service.
He is set to announce other measures including more spending on roads, a tax cut for small retailers hammered by online competition and more spending on broadband.
Hammond hinted on Sunday that he would soften the impact of changes to the welfare system and said he wanted a timetable for progress on getting giant tech firms to pay more tax.
For now, however, he is expected to shy away from talking about a broader push for higher taxes that fiscal experts say Britain will need in order to meet the costs of an aging population.

Last year, Hammond was forced into a U-turn on his plan to raise more tax from self-employed people after an uproar within the Conservative Party, which has since have lost its majority in parliament.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Nuclear ban treaty could come into force in 2019, campaigners say","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - A treaty banning nuclear weapons could come into force by the end of 2019, backers of a campaign that won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize said in an annual progress report on Monday.
The treaty aims to stigmatize nuclear weapons as previous treaties marginalized landmines and cluster munitions. Signatories promise to reject nuclear strategies and encourage others to follow suit.
The Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor, published by Norwegian People's Aid, said 19 states had already adhered to the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, putting it well on the way to the 50 ratifications it needs to come into force.
""We’re pushing for getting 50 ratifications by the end of 2019,"" said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.
""We have about 25, 30 countries that say that they will be ready by the end of 2019, so it’s definitely possible.""
The big nuclear powers oppose the treaty because they say it could undermine nuclear deterrence, which they credit with preventing conventional war. Fihn told Reuters such arguments were ridiculous scaremongering.
""If you follow that argument, that more nuclear weapons keeps us safer, then why have a problem with North Korea having nuclear weapons?,"" she said. 
""It’s a little bit like the gun debate in the United States – you feel safer, but all statistics and logic say that you are more likely to be shot if you have a weapon at home."" 
U.S. President Donald Trump has employed a high-stakes nuclear strategy to face down North Korea and Iran, and said on Oct. 20 that Washington planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan signed in 1987.
Fihn said the INF prohibited missiles that were ""meant to wipe out cities in Europe"" and the new nuclear arms race made it urgent for countries to ratify the ban treaty. 
The report identified 127 states as supporters of the treaty, especially in Africa and Latin America. 
""The Europeans are the problem,"" said Fihn. 
Grethe Ostern, the report's editor, said the treaty was compatible with NATO membership, but it was seen as disloyal to question the usefulness of nuclear weapons, and states were under pressure to oppose it.

""We know that states sometimes feel that development aid is sometimes put in the balance. We know that they feel that if they have visa arrangements with the U.S., for instance, they feel that this is in the balance,"" Ostern said.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>","For Taiwan youth, military service is a hard sell despite China tension","By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Air Force Staff Sergeant Jiang Pin-shiuan's pitch to freshmen at Taipei's Tamkang University seemed compelling: join the island's armed forces and get a state-sponsored degree, 110 days of leave each year and annual savings of T$312,500 ($10,200). 
But many listening students showed little interest, arguing national service was a ""waste of time"" and prospects of the self-ruled island standing up economically or militarily to an increasingly aggressive China were slim. 
""China could simply crush Taiwan with its economic power. There's no need for a war, which wastes money,"" said 18-year-old Chen Fang-yi, an engineering major. ""I do not have much confidence and expectation for the national army.""
From lectures in universities and high schools across the island, life-size dancing dolls to a flash mob performance by a special forces unit, Taiwan's military is working hard to recruit soldiers as it moves to a fully volunteer force after decades of conscription. 
Taiwan vowed in 2011 to phase out conscription to cut costs and boost the professionalism of its forces as it tries to better deter the Chinese threat through enhanced cyber warfare capabilities and other high-tech weapons. 
The island's defense ministry said it will be able to reach a target of enlisting 81 percent of the estimated 188,000 volunteer troops needed to defend against any attack by Beijing by year-end. It hopes to raise that to 90 percent by 2020.         
Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it to heel.
But military experts and government auditors say recruitment is proving challenging and the growth in voluntary recruitment isn't fast enough to catch up with a worsening military imbalance across the strait.
China, whose official defense budget grew to roughly 15 times that of Taiwan's last year, has alarmed Taipei by flying bombers around the island and luring away members of its dwindling band of diplomatic allies.
In a report from December, three government auditors warned the growth of voluntary recruits had been slow, raising concerns about Taiwan's combat power. 
""The government needs to think whether it's necessary to bring conscription back if they think national security matters,"" said Lin Yu-fang, a convener for the Taipei-based National Policy Foundation and former head of Taiwan's congressional defense and foreign committee. 
""We will pay a heavy price for the move...We won't be able to find enough soldiers."" 
The island's defense ministry told Reuters it will continue to raise the quantity and quality of its armed forces and has made all necessary plans for possible military actions from China. It also urged the public to give ""support and encouragement"" to the transition.  
       
DODGING TRAINING
Convincing more young people to join the armed forces is made more difficult by Taiwan's past as a military dictatorship. The death of a young conscript in 2013 after being punished for misconduct, which triggered large protests, also dealt a blow to the army. 
The service is so unpopular that more than 1,000 reservists were charged in the last three years for dodging mandatory retraining.
""It raises a very difficult question about national morale. If there ever is a conflict, what are people going to do?"" said William Stanton, professor at National Taiwan University and former head of the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei.  
Taiwan last year spent nearly 47 percent of its defense budget of T$319.3 billion on manpower-related costs. Military experts said that squeezed the budget for weapon acquisitions.   
The island's goal to move to an all volunteer force by 2019 will be ""costlier than anticipated"", diverting funds from defense acquisition and readiness, the U.S. Defense Department said in a report to Congress in May.          
Taiwan has shortened its mandatory service to a four-month training, from three years, a move analysts said was made to placate young voters who prioritize personal liberty over civil obligations.
But for some, even the reduced training is seen as an exercise in futility.
""We won't win a war with China anyway,"" said 20-year-old graduate Hsu Kai-wen, a reluctant conscript who was recently assigned a four-month service in the navy after drawing lots. ""Why do I need to waste my time in the army?""

His drop in popularity follows the Liberals' loss of its one-seat majority in a by-election in the seat of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, which left the Liberal-National coalition as a minority government.
Despite Morrison's negative rating, the Newspoll found 58 percent of voters want parliament to run to a full term, with an election due in May 2019.
The government has had a bad two weeks, after announcing a controversial plan to consider moving the Australian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; mistakenly backing an ""it's ok to be white"" motion in parliament; and then losing the Wentworth by-election.
The seat was won by independent Kerryn Phelps in a huge swing against the Liberals, who had held the seat for more than a century.
The Newspoll found that the number dissatisfied with Morrison jumped six points to 44 percent, which gave the prime minister a net negative approval rating for the first time. 
Satisfaction with Morrison dropped from 7 on Oct. 15 to -3 on Oct. 28. However, he was still ahead of opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten, who had a satisfaction rating of -13.
Based on the results of the poll, the government would lose 19 seats in an election.
The federal Liberals are considered so tainted that Morrison did not even show up at the party's campaign launch on Sunday for a state election in Victoria, to be held on Nov. 24.

The Gaza Health Ministry said two of the dead were aged 13 and one aged 14.
Gaza medics have tallied more than 216 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces at the frontier during almost seven months of Palestinian protests against Israel's blockade of the territory and in support of a right for Palestinian refugees to return to lands in Israel. One Israeli soldier has been killed by a sniper.
Israel says its lethal response is necessary to prevent armed infiltrations from Gaza. The violence has occasionally escalated into shelling exchanges that Israel has warned could trigger war, while Egypt and the United Nations have repeatedly mediated truces.
In Sunday's incident, an Israeli aircraft struck ""three terrorists adjacent to the fence who were trying to sabotage it and were apparently planting a bomb,"" the Israeli military said in a statement.
Four Palestinians were killed at the border on Friday, and a Gaza militant group responded by firing a volley of missiles into Israel, prompting scores of Israeli retaliatory air strikes on Saturday, although nobody was killed.
Two million Palestinians live in Gaza, most of them stateless descendants of people who fled or were driven from homes in Israel at its founding in 1948.
The narrow seaside territory has been ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group, since 2007, during which time it has fought three wars against Israel.
Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade for security reasons, which the World Bank says has brought the territory to a state of economic collapse, nearly entirely dependent on international aid and without adequate electricity, health care or clean water.

McCarthy's office did not address Steyer's charge but said the congressman strongly condemns violence and ""simply points out the enormous financial contributions a select few have made in this year’s midterm campaigns.""
Soros and Steyer were among the prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump who received parcel bombs last week.
In an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Steyer said he took McCarthy's tweet, which accompanied a video of him making the same remarks, at face value.
""In terms of interpreting what he said, that seems, to me, like a straight-up anti-Semitic move,"" Steyer said. ""I think that there - that is a classic attempt to separate Americans. I think that absolutely falls into the category of what I'm describing as political violence.""
Steyer spoke a day after a gunman killed 11 Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States.
Steyer, who is well known for his ads calling for Trump's impeachment, said he did not blame the Republican president for Saturday's deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, ""but I'm absolutely associating and blaming him for creating the atmosphere that exists.""  
He said the Republican Party has created a politically violent atmosphere and accused Trump himself of lawlessness.

Trump responded on Twitter that he watched ""Wacky Tom Steyer"" who ""comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A political crisis in Sri Lanka took a deadly turn on Sunday, with one person killed when a sacked cabinet minister tried to re-enter his office, days after the president removed the prime minister and installed a powerful ally of China in his place.
Sri Lanka has been plunged into crisis since Friday, when President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and swore in ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new prime minister to replace him.
Sirisena said the move was motivated by a plot to kill him, and by economic collapse. Wickremesinghe says it was illegal and he is still prime minister.
In a statement released late on Sunday, Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005-2015, said he would ""eschew the politics of hate and set up an interim government that will protect the human rights of all citizens, that will protect the independence of the judiciary and establish law and order.""
He called on lawmakers to support his new government. 
On Saturday, Sirisena suspended parliament until Nov. 16, a move the ousted prime minister's supporters say was intended to prevent lawmakers from demonstrating their continued support for Wickremesinghe. 
The standoff has important geopolitical implications in a country long influenced by its neighbor India, but which became massively indebted to China to finance huge infrastructure projects during Rajapaksa's decade as president.
Most of Sri Lanka's foreign allies including India, the European Union and the United States, have urged Sirisena to abide by the constitution. But China, long seen as a supporter of Rajapaksa, congratulated him on becoming prime minister, drawing accusations from Wickremesinghe's supporters that Beijing was behind the attempt to change the government. Chinese officials deny interfering in Sri Lanka's affairs.
Since Rajapaksa was sworn in, trade unions allied to him have blocked government buildings to prevent members of the former cabinet from reaching their offices.
Sunday's violence took place at the headquarters of state oil company Ceylon Petroleum Corp, where Arjuna Ranatunga, petroleum minister in the ousted cabinet, tried to re-enter his office. Police said one of Ranatunga's security guards opened fire. One person was killed and two wounded.
The guard had been arrested and an investigation launched, police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said. Ranatunga was safe and the security guard's motive was not immediately clear, he added.
Local media said Ranatunga had briefly been held hostage in the office. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm details of the incident.
""INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY""
So far, a majority of lawmakers has not endorsed the change in government. In a letter sent on Sunday, parliament speaker Karu Jayasuriya urged the president to protect Wickremesinghe's rights and privileges ""until any other person emerges from within the Parliament as having secure confidence of the Parliament"".
In an address to the nation, Sirisena said his action to change the government was ""totally in accordance with the constitution and on the advice of legal experts"".
The Rajapaksa faction has sought to win over lawmakers to back it in parliament. Two Wickremesinghe loyalists have pledged support to Rajapaksa and sources close to Rajapaksa have said there will be more cross-overs.
Ranjan Ramanayake, a legislator from Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP), said some lawmakers had been offered up to 800 million rupees ($4.6 million) each to switch sides and support Rajapaksa. Reuters was unable to confirm this.
""This is an international conspiracy,"" Ramanayake told reporters at Wickremesinghe's official residence, accusing China of ""spending money to buy over members"".
A Chinese embassy official in Colombo denied the allegation and said Beijing maintained good relations with all Sri Lankan parties, including the UNP.
""China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs,"" the official told Reuters. ""We're against all this interference from any foreign country.""
Cheng Xueyuan, China's envoy to Sri Lanka, met Rajapaksa with a congratulatory message on Saturday. The embassy official said the ambassador had also met Wickremesinghe and speaker Jayasuriya.
India and Western countries have concerns about Rajapaksa's ties to China, after he ushered in billions of dollars of investment from Beijing to rebuild the country following the end of a 26-year war against Tamil separatists in 2009.
That investment has since put the tiny nation deep in debt and forced it to hand over control of a strategic port to China.

""As a democracy and a close friendly neighbor, we hope that democratic values and the constitutional process will be respected,"" said Raveesh Kumar, spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs. ""We will continue to extend our developmental assistance to the friendly people of Sri Lanka.""

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A new group of migrants gathered and left from the capital of El Salvador on Sunday, headed for the United States after thousands of other Central Americans began similar journeys in recent weeks, angering U.S. President Donald Trump.
The group of more than 300 Salvadorans that left San Salvador on Sunday came together after thousands of Hondurans in mid-October left their country in a large group, becoming an international news story and a key issue in the U.S. congressional elections.
A second group of Hondurans was moving through Guatemala last week, and at one point numbered more than 1,000 people before beginning to fragment.
Trump and his fellow Republicans have sought to make immigration a major issue before the Nov. 6 elections, in which the party is battling to keep control of Congress.
The Salvadoran migrants organized using social networks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp over the last couple of weeks, inspired by the group of mostly Hondurans currently crossing Mexico. 
Salvadoran police traveled with the group on Sunday as they left San Salvador, the migrants carrying backpacks and water bottles and protecting themselves from the hot sun with hats. Some mothers pushed their children in strollers.
Several migrants, gathered by the capital's 'Savior of the World' statue before leaving, said they were headed to the United States.
""We're asking the all-powerful to look after us, to guide us, to free us from all that is bad,"" shouted Hernan Quinteros, 49, a driver who urged his fellow travelers to tie up their shoes ahead of the long trip.

El Salvador's left-wing government said it had solidarity with the migrants and respected their right to mobilize, but urged them not to risk their lives on the way.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>","With border open, Jordanians visit Syria for first time in years","DAMASCUS/JABER, Jordan (Reuters) - Jordanians are flocking to the Syrian capital Damascus for the first time in years for tourism and trade after the reopening of a border crossing that had been closed through years of war.
The border opened to people and goods on Oct. 15, restoring a route that had carried billions of dollars in trade for the region.
""The first day that Syria opened up, I came. This is my second time since then,"" said Mahmoud Nassar, 62, a flight engineer from Jordan's northern city of Ramtha.
""This is a visit of tourism and of yearning for (Damascus),"" said Nassar, who drove in with his father and son. ""The road is safe and there were no problems.""
Syrian government forces retook the border region with Jordan from rebels in July during a Russian-backed offensive.
The crossing had been closed since rebels captured it in 2015, though many are making the trip for the first time since 2011, when the Syrian conflict first erupted.
The Jordanian side of the frontier was jammed with vehicles waiting to cross on Friday. ""What we see is the situation is good, things are fine,"" said Razzan al-Hattab, a Jordanian waiting to cross. ""I love Sham (Damascus), so I wanted to be one of the first to try going in a tourist group.""
""I WILL VISIT EVERY WEEK""
The closure of the border has hit both the Syrian and Jordanian economies. ""Before the border closed, our work was great,"" said Jawad al-Zoubi, waiting to cross. But for ""the last seven years, we've not been able to pay school fees"", he said.
Bahjat Rizik, in Damascus with his wife and son, said the last time he made the three-hour drive from Amman was before the war began. He used to bring office furniture to sell in Syria and owned a gallery in the Yarmouk district near Damascus. 
""I will visit every week,"" said Rizik, carrying bags of children's clothes and spices with his family.
""God willing, we can get back to work.""
Bilal Bashi, who runs a company selling abayas in Damascus, said he had seen more Jordanian tourists and shoppers since the crossing opened. ""No doubt there will be an economic (boost). It will have a positive effect,"" he said at the historic Souk al-Hamidieh market in the Old City of Damascus.
Still, Raed Maseh, another Syrian trader, said the increase in Jordanian visitors had not had a real impact yet and hoped more people would come.
The Syrian war further added to the strain on an already difficult relationship between Damascus and Amman. U.S.-allied Jordan provided support to some of the insurgents fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
But diplomatic ties were not severed entirely and Syria's relations with Jordan never turned as hostile as they did with some other regional states, notably Turkey which remains a major backer of the opposition. 
Intisar Murshid, the head of a Damascus hotel, said she received some 14 Jordanian guests on the first day the crossing opened. They came to shop, work, or visit relatives. 

""For eight years we did not see Jordanians, very rarely.""

393,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>",Syria's national museum reopens doors in war-scarred Damascus,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syria's National Museum of Damascus opened its rich trove of antiquities to visitors again on Sunday, seven years after war forced them to close and months after the government recaptured all rebel areas near the capital. 
Only part of the museum, and its collection drawn from the civilizations that have ruled Syria over the millennia, will be reopened immediately, its deputy director Ahmad Deeb said. 
""We will exhibit a group of artefacts from all periods from prehistory, the ancient east and the classical and Islamic eras in this section,"" he said.
The reopening is a sign of the government's attempts to restore normality in the capital after a succession of Russia-backed army victories since 2015 that have ended the threat to President Bashar al-Assad's rule. 
A bloody army offensive this spring forced the rebels to surrender eastern Ghouta in April, and the remaining insurgents enclaves near Damascus capitulated in the following weeks. 
The conflict continues, with swathes of the country still outside Assad's control, but it has stabilized with a Russian-Turkish deal over the last rebel bastion in the northwest, and U.S. backing for Kurdish-led forces in the northeast. 
The fate of Syria's ancient heritage has hung in the balance for much of the conflict, as fighting erupted in major sites such as the Old City of Aleppo and others, including the desert ruins of Palmyra, fell into the hands of iconoclastic jihadists. 
As the insurgency began to spread in 2011, the government evacuated the museum's collection, one of the most important in the Middle East, along with those of provincial museums, hiding their artefacts far from the battlefield.
In Aleppo, where the museum lay near the front line, the huge ancient statues outside were too large to transport, and were boarded up in giant crates filled with cement against shrapnel damage. 
""The masterpieces were hidden straight away,"" said Deeb. Army trucks carried antiquities from sites across the country to stash in safety, he said. The collection of Deir al-Zor museum, isolated by fighting, was airlifted to Damascus. 
In the capital, the empty museum continued to be used by the General Directorate of Antiquities as an office, and was hit by mortar fire, but not badly damaged. 
As the rebel presence around Damascus weakened in recent years, some statues were put on display to the public in the museum garden, including the Lion of Elat, a massive piece from Palmyra that was damaged by Islamic State and later restored. 

Other objects, recovered by the government after they were seized by insurgents or smuggled overseas, were put on display this month in the Damascus Opera House, a testament to the looting of heritage that has characterized much of the war.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that the United States was in consultation with its European allies on an arms control treaty, as NATO members urge Washington to try to bring Russia back into compliance with the pact rather than quit it.
President Donald Trump said on Oct. 20 that Washington planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan had signed in 1987.
Washington has cited Russia's alleged violation of the treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies. Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact and says it is working to answer U.S. questions about the pact. 
""We are in consultations with our European counterparts, I was speaking about it the day before with the German defense minister, and so as I said the consultations continue,"" Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Prague. 
He will be meeting his Czech counterpart and Prime Minister Andrej Babis during a short trip to Prague. 
Mattis said ministers from NATO would be meeting in Brussels in December and at that point he would have some kind of ""culminating point"".
European members of NATO urged the United States on Thursday to try to bring Russia back into compliance with a nuclear arms control treaty rather than quitting it itself, diplomats said, seeking to avoid a split in the alliance that Moscow could exploit.
European allies see the INF treaty as a pillar of arms control and, while accepting that Moscow is violating it by developing new weapons, they are concerned its collapse could lead to a new arms race with possibly a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles stationed on the continent.
QUESTIONS
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday that Moscow has started preparing answers to the questions related to the arms control pact delivered by U.S. officials, RIA news agency quoted him as saying.
""Just a week ago, a couple of days ahead of the announcement of the (U.S.) aim to leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, Americans via their embassy in Moscow sent the Russian Foreign Ministry an extensive list of questions which are a concern to them,"" Lavrov said.
Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying that his ministry has sent the list to the Defence Ministry and other governmental bodies but the fact that the notice given was short ""does not contribute to the sustainable dialogue and predictability (in the U.S. behavior)"". 
Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Trump's plans to develop new ballistic missiles after the United States quits a landmark arms control pact were ""extremely dangerous"". 
Mattis said he had asked his NATO counterparts after the last summit if they had any ideas on how to bring Russia back into compliance of INF treaty, but so far none had come back to him.
Heather Conley, a former U.S. State Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Mattis would receive a range of questions from European allies, such as when a formal notification would be made and whether it signals a new arms race. 
""It just deepens the uncertainty. Our allies do not know where U.S. leadership is going, what it's going to do from the day to day basis,"" Conley said.
When asked whether he could rule out placing intermediate range missiles on the ground if Washington left the INF treaty, Mattis said: ""I never rule things out like that, I also don't rule it in.""

""There are a number of ways for us to respond, it does not have to be symmetric and it'll be in close consultation with allies,"" he added.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that he had met Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and called for a transparent investigation into the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Washington Post columnist Khashoggi's murder has escalated into a crisis for the world’s top oil exporter as Saudi Arabia's allies have reacted with outrage.
Mattis said he met Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir during a conference in Bahrain on Saturday and discussed the killing.
""We discussed it. You know the same thing we talked about, the need for transparency, full and complete investigation,"" Mattis told a small group of reporters traveling to Prague with him.
""(There was) full agreement from foreign minister Jubeir, no reservations at all, he said we need to know what happened and it was very collaborative, in agreement,"" Mattis added.    
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to get to the bottom of the case, while also highlighting Riyadh's role as an ally against Tehran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi's killing was premeditated, contradicting a previous official statement that it happened accidentally during a tussle in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
On Saturday, Jubeir told a security summit in Bahrain that Riyadh's relations with the United States were ""ironclad"" amid what he described as ""media hysteria"" over the killing of Khashoggi.
At the same conference, Mattis had sharp words for Saudi Arabia, saying that the killing undermined Middle Eastern stability and that Washington would take additional measures against those responsible.
Earlier this month U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met the Saudi king and crown prince to discuss the issue.
Washington has already announced moves against 21 Saudis to either revoke their visas or make them ineligible for U.S. visas after the Khashoggi killing.
Asked whether the U.S. would limit its support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Mattis said on Sunday: ""We'll continue to support the defense of the kingdom.""
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states trying to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015.
The United States and other Western powers provide arms, refueling and intelligence to the alliance.

Germany has vowed to halt all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the killing of Khashoggi is explained.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition faces its second test in as many weeks on Sunday as voters go to the polls in the western state of Hesse for a regional election that could torpedo the national government.
The Hesse election has taken on extra significance after another regional vote on Oct. 14 resulted in the worst result since 1950 for Merkel's Bavarian allies and humiliation for the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), her other ruling partner.
Should Merkel's conservative ally in Hesse, Volker Bouffier, lose his post as state premier, the chancellor's enemies will be emboldened ahead of her Christian Democrats' (CDU) party congress in early December and may try to hasten her demise.
The other risk for Merkel is that her SPD coalition partners come third in Hesse, which is home to financial hub Frankfurt. Such an outcome would increase pressure from the SPD's rank-and-file for the party to pull out of the coalition with Merkel in Berlin.
""Will Hesse blow up the GroKo today?"" newspaper Bild am Sonntag asked, using the popular abbreviation for Merkel's ruling 'grand coalition'.
A survey by pollster Emnid for the newspaper showed support nationally for Merkel's conservative alliance down 1 percentage point on the week at 24 percent, with the SPD on 15 percent - sharp falls from the 32.9 percent and 20.5 percent they won respectively at last year's national election.
Voters said they were tired of infighting in the grand coalition.
A growing swell of SPD members feel their party is tarnished by its alliance with Merkel and would be best to rebuild in opposition - a scenario SPD leader Andreas Nahles has resisted.
""It is not advisable for the SPD to act hastily or recklessly,"" Nahles said ahead of the vote.
Voting in Hesse began at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and polls are open until 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), when exit polls will give a first indication of the result.
GREENS GAIN
Merkel's preferred successor as leader of her conservatives, CDU Secretary General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has warned the SPD that pulling out of the ruling coalition after the Hesse vote would trigger a federal election.
SPD would suffer heavily in a national vote, with the Greens and far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) set to gain. The Emnid poll put support for the Greens at 20 percent and the AfD on 16 percent nationally, both up 1 point on the week.
In Hesse, support for the CDU is running at 28 percent, a survey by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for broadcaster ZDF showed on Thursday. But the CDU and ecologist Greens may lack sufficient support to renew their ruling alliance in the state.
The SPD and Greens were tied on 20 percent, the state poll showed, with the AfD on 12 points, and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and far-left Linke both on 8 points.
The Greens could figure in a number of potential coalitions in Hesse should they and the CDU lack sufficient support to remain in power.
The CDU and Greens could team up with the FDP; the Greens, SPD and FDP could, in theory, join forces - though the FDP is not keen; or the Greens and SPD could work with the far-left Linke.

The Greens' half-Yemeni leader in Hesse, Tarek Al-Wazir, is not committing to any coalition until after the vote.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, ending a month-long meeting on the theme of Catholic youth, told young people Sunday that in order to be good members of the Church they should not be obsessed with ""doctrinal formulae"" but blend its rules with social activism to help those in need.
Francis said a Mass for about 10,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica to ceremoniously close the Synod of Bishops, officially titled ""Young People, Faith and Discernment of Vocation"" and attended by some 300 bishops, priests, nuns and lay participants.
The gathering's final document, issued late on Saturday night, called for women to play a greater role in Church decision-making as a ""duty of justice"", but appeared to water down language that would have been more welcoming to gays. [L8N1X70OS]
""I would like to say to the young people, in the name of all of us adults: forgive us if often we have not listened to you, if, instead of opening our hearts, we have filled your ears,"" Francis said in a lighter part of the homily of the Mass, which he co-celebrated with dozens of the bishops who took part in the synod.
But he also went to the heart of accusations against him by some conservatives in the Church who say he has watered down emphasis on doctrinal matters and Church rules in favor of social issues such as migration, poverty and the environment.
In his homily, he said both were necessary. 
""Faith passes through life. When faith is concerned purely with doctrinal formulae, it risks speaking only to the head without touching the heart,"" he said.
""And when it is concerned with activity alone, it risks turning into mere moralizing and social work. Faith, instead, is life: it is living in the love of God who has changed our lives. We cannot choose between doctrine and activism.""
He said young people could not wash their hands about the problems of their neighbors but ""dirty"" them"" if they really wanted to imitate Jesus, ""not (as) specialists in the sacred, but witnesses of the love that saves"".

The pope, who attended the synods sessions every day, will now take the final document into consideration when writing his own document, known as an ""Apostolic Exhortation.""

LEICESTER, England (Reuters) - Leicester City soccer club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, a Thai tycoon, was among five people who were in a helicopter which crashed in a ball of flames after a Premier League match on Saturday, a source close to the club said.
Also on board were one of Vichai's two daughters, two pilots and a fifth person whose identity was not immediately known, the source said on Sunday.
There were no confirmed details on whether anyone on board survived, the source said.
Vichai, a father of four and the founder of duty-free giant King Power International, is a huge favorite with the fans after he bought the unfancied side from central England in 2010 and they went on to stun the soccer world by winning the Premier League title in 2016.
In Thailand, officials at King Power said they could not yet comment on the crash or say whether Vichai had been aboard when it spiraled out of control and crashed around an hour after the game. The club has not commented on that publicly.
The helicopter crashed just yards from the pitch in the club's car park. Team manager Claude Puel was not on the helicopter, the source said.
According to witnesses, the helicopter just cleared the top of the stadium before it started to spin. It then plummeted to the ground and burst into flames.
John Butcher, who was near the stadium at the time of the crash, told the BBC his nephew saw the helicopter spiral out of control apparently due to a faulty rear propeller.
""Within a second it dropped like a stone to the floor ... Luckily it did spiral for a little while and everybody sort of ran, sort of scattered. As far as we are aware nobody around the car park was caught up in this problem.""
TITLE WIN
After pumping millions of pounds into the club, Vichai helped steer Leicester back into the top flight in 2014 before they stunned the sport by beating the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea to become champions of England.
According to Forbes magazine he is the fifth richest person in Thailand with an estimated net worth of $4.9 billion.
The self-made businessman Vichai founded Thai duty-free giant King Power in 1989.
The duty-free business got a big boost in 2006 when it was granted an airport monopoly under the government of then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and it continued to prosper even after Thaksin's ousting in a coup that year.
The family's empire also includes Belgian football club, Oud-Heverlee Leuven.
Leading Leicester players, including Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire, sent messages of support on Twitter while rival clubs including Manchester City also voiced their concern.
Freelance photographer Ryan Brown was covering the game and saw the helicopter clear the stadium before it crashed.
""Literally the engine stopped and I turned around, and it made a bit of a whirring noise,"" Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It turned silent, blades started spinning and then there was a big bang.""

Leicester had played a league match at home against West Ham United earlier on Saturday, drawing 1-1.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Sunday that efforts to clean up corruption in state-owned companies (SOCs) faced ""dangerous"" resistance which threatened the country's sovereignty.
Gordhan, a former finance minister, has been tasked by President Cyril Ramaphosa with cleaning up SOCs such as power utility Eskom, which suffered misgovernance under former president Jacob Zuma.
In an opinion piece in the Sunday Times newspaper, Gordhan said that new boards had started to address ""the depth of corruption and criminal behavior that seems to have become endemic in these institutions."" 
""But the dangerous and unscrupulous fightback against our reform efforts continues. If we allow this fightback to prevail, we risk losing our sovereignty,"" he said, without naming who was behind the backlash.
But in another context Gordhan did specify the Gupta family, a trio of wealthy Indian brothers widely accused of using their friendship with Zuma to siphon state proceeds or win contracts for their companies - allegations they and Zuma have consistently denied.
Referring to state-run logistics and railway group Transnet, Gordhan said academics, which it did not identify, had found that at least 37 billion rand ($2.5 billion) was allocated by the company ""toward tainted deals for the period 2012 to 2017.""
""Of this, about 7.7 billion rand appears to have been paid illicitly in various forms to a number of firms linked to the Gupta network,"" he wrote. 
No-one at Transnet was immediately available to comment.
Officials representing the Guptas were also not immediately available for comment.
""Over the past seven months, we have been piecing together the story of how are SOCs were repurposed to benefit a few, with repercussions for the rest of the country which has suffered financially,"" Gordhan wrote.
""The challenges facing SOCs are also structural, and cannot simply be solved with a cash injection. Dismantling the destructive business-state patronage networks that have embedded themselves across public enterprises ... will require time, difficult choices and bold action by leaders,"" he said.
Companies that have been caught up in the unfolding scandals have included accountancy KPMG, which has cut jobs in South Africa and lost business over work done for a company owned by the Guptas.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>","Names of dead, possible motive to be released in mass shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue","By John Altdorfer and Chriss Swaney
PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The names of those shot dead by a gunman yelling ""All Jews must die"" will be released on Sunday after the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States, officials said.
The gunman stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue during Saturday services, killing 11 worshippers and wounding six other people including four police officers, before he was arrested.
Pittsburg Mayor Bill Peduto told CBS television station KDKA that when the list of the dead is released by federal officials at a news conference at 9 a.m. on Sunday, it ""will rip your heart out"", saying he personally knew some of the victims.
The Tree of Life synagogue in the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a heavily Jewish area, was holding a Shabbat religious service at the time of the shooting. 
The mass shooting prompted security alerts at houses of worship around the country. It follows a spate of pipe bombs found mailed in recent days to prominent political figures, mostly Democrats including former President Barack Obama.
The U.S. Attorney's Office said it would make public the charging complaint and an official affidavit, which may shed light on why Robert Bowers, 46, of Pittsburgh, allegedly shot the worshippers. 
Bowers had made many anti-Semitic posts online, including one early on Saturday. In another, he slammed U.S. President Donald Trump for doing nothing to stop an ""infestation"" of the United States by Jews.
A social media post by Bowers on Saturday morning said a Jewish refugee organization, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, ""likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in"".
The comment was posted on Gab, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based social networking service created as an alternative to Twitter. In a statement, Gab.com confirmed the profile belonged to Bowers and also said it had suspended the account and contacted the FBI about it. 
Bowers was taken into custody after a shootout with a SWAT team. Federal prosecutors charged him with 29 criminal counts including violence and firearms offenses, and violating U.S. civil rights laws.
""The actions of Robert Bowers represent the worst of humanity. We are dedicating the entire resources of my office to this federal hate crime investigation and prosecution,"" U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania Scott Brady told reporters.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors could seek the death penalty.
CANDLELIT VIGIL
The Anti-Defamation League and Jewish Council for Public Affairs described it as the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.
FBI special agent Bob Jones said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the probe, said the crime scene was the worst he had seen in 22 years with the FBI. He said he believed Bowers was acting alone, adding: ""We have no knowledge that he was known to law enforcement before today."" 
KDKA television cited police sources as saying Bowers walked into the building and yelled ""All Jews must die"".
Jones said Bowers was armed with an assault rifle and three handguns. 
He said authorities believed the suspect entered the synagogue, murdered the worshippers and was leaving when he encountered a uniformed police officer. The pair exchanged gunfire, Jones said, and Bowers reentered the building before a SWAT team arrived. After a shootout, he surrendered.
Bowers was taken to a hospital where he was listed in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds. 
Trump said in a tweet he was watching what he described as a ""devastating"" situation. He told reporters the killings might have been prevented if there had been an armed guard. 
""If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a much more different situation, they didn't,"" he said. Police are normally only present at the synagogue for security on high holidays.
He called on Americans to rise above hate and ordered U.S. flags at the White House and public buildings to be flown at half-staff. He said he would visit Pittsburgh, but not when. 
Mourners held a candlelit vigil for the victims. The Islamic Center Of Pittsburgh offered its condolences, and called on its community to donate blood.
The shooting followed attacks on other places of worship in recent years. On April 13, 2014, a pair of shootings occurred at a Jewish Community Center and a Jewish retirement community, both located in Overland Park, Kansas. A total of three people were killed in the shootings.
In 2015, a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans during a prayer service in Charleston, South Carolina. 
In 2012, a neo-Nazi gunman with white supremacist ties walked into a Sikh gurdwara - or house of worship - in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and murdered six Sikh Americans.

Political activities in Thailand were banned by the junta after the military ousted a Puea Thai-led government under former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra in May 2014.
Last month, the junta partially lifted the ban to allow political parties prepare for the poll which it said will take place sometime from February through May.
The Puea Thai assembly voted in former deputy prime minister Viroj Pao-in, 84, as party leader and veteran politician Phumtham Vechayaychai, 64, as secretary-general.
Party core member Sudarat Keyuraphan, 57, was also voted in as a chairperson for the party's executive committee and another committee that will oversee the selection of party candidates for the election.
""What I have to do now is to gather all the capable people in the party and bring out their best to work for the people,"" Sudarat told reporters at the assembly.
""We will now go and talk to the people and consult them to formulate our party's policies,"" Sudarat said.
Newly elected party executives said it was too soon for the party to nominate its candidate to contest for prime minister and instead will focus on working out the party's policies first.
For more than a decade Thailand has been divided between populist political forces - now led by the Puea Thai Party backed by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was toppled in a 2006 coup - and the royalist and military establishment.
Thaksin's sister Yingluk swept to power in an election in 2011, before being ousted in another coup in 2014.
""In the past there has been efforts to destroy our party in various ways but because of the support from the people we believe the party can overcome,"" Phumtham, the party's secretary-general, told the media at the party's general assembly.
""Now we are ready to move toward the election,"" he said.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2018 01:51AM ET</span>",Brazil's Bolsonaro poised to win presidency in dramatic swing right,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilians fed up with political corruption and rising crime are expected to vote in former army captain turned politician Jair Bolsonaro as their president on Sunday in a turbulent swing to the right in the world's fourth largest democracy.
Bolsonaro's sudden rise was propelled by rejection of the leftist Workers Party (PT) that ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and was ousted two years ago in the midst of the country's worst recession and biggest graft and bribery scandal.
His leftist rival Fernando Haddad, standing in for the jailed PT founder and former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been trailing Bolsonaro since the first round vote three weeks ago.
But final opinion polls on Saturday showing Haddad gaining momentum and endorsements from leading legal figures in Brazil’s unprecedented fight against political corruption have raised hopes among his supporters that he can pull off what would be a stunning upset win.
Haddad has reduced Bolsonaro's lead from 12 to 8 percentage points in five days, according to the Ibope polling firm that gave him 46 percent of voter support compared with Bolsonaro's 54 percent. A Datafolha poll also released late Saturday showed Bolsonaro had 55 percent and Haddad 45 percent.
Haddad failed to win the crucial endorsement of center-left former candidate Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in the northeast, which would have given Haddad a big lift in Brazil's poorest region. 
But Rodrigo Janot, Brazil's former prosecutor general under whose watch unprecedented prosecutions of endemic political graft took place, tweeted that he would vote for Haddad. Popular anti-corruption judge, Joaquim Barbosa, who jailed several top PT leaders for corruption, also came out for Haddad.
The endorsements were a blow to Bolsonaro's campaign to position himself as the only anti-corruption candidate.
""I think we are at the brink of a process that could push our democracy beyond its limits,"" Janot told Reuters.
Many Brazilians are concerned that Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship and a defender of its use of torture on leftist opponents, will trample on human rights, curtail civil liberties and muzzle freedom of speech.
The 63-year-old seven-term congressman has vowed to crack down on crime in Brazil's cities and farm belt by granting police more autonomy to shoot at armed criminals and easing gun laws to allow Brazilians to buy weapons to fight crime, a major demand by one of his biggest backers, the powerful farm lobby.
""This is not just an election. We only have two options: to turn right or left, and we all know where the left took us for 13 years with the PT,"" Bolsonaro said in his final video address to supporters on Saturday evening. ""We want a free Brazil.""
MARKETS HAPPY
Investors are heartened by Bolsonaro's choice of Paulo Guedes, a Chicago University-trained economist and investment banker as his economic guru and likely finance minister.
Brazil's most polarized election since 1985 and the near-fatal stabbing of Bolsonaro at a rally a month ago have caused turbulence on markets, yet the real currency  strengthened 9.7 percent against the dollar in last 30 days as his prospects of winning increased. Sao Paulo's benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) has risen 13.5 percent since mid September.
Guedes is keen to privatize hundreds of state companies, including units of oil company Petrobras and utility Eletrobras. His free-market ideas have clashed with the views of a group of retired army generals who are helping Bolsonaro draw up policies and believe strategic resources should remain in state hands.
Environmentalists are concerned that Bolsonaro will reduce Brazil's efforts to stop deforestation of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, which is seen as essential to soaking up carbon emissions responsible for global warming. He has, however, backed off a plan to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change accord.
Bolsonaro's critics fear he will allow commercial farming and mining to penetrate on Indian reservations, which he has said he will not expand by a single centimeter if he is elected.
He told Xingú tribes people on Friday they had the right to charge royalties for mining and hydro electric power generation on their reservations, a proposal welcomed by some natives but rejected by anthropologists and environmentalists who see the tribes as the last guardians of the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity.

""You are as Brazilian as any of us,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I want you to have the right to use your land and exploit its biodiversity and mineral riches.""

The royal couple, who have already visited Australia, Fiji and Tonga, were received at Wellington airport by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
The official welcome ceremony took place on the lawns of Government House - the residence of the Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy.
Harry and Meghan rubbed noses with Maori leaders in a traditional ""hongi"" greeting and were welcomed by a ""haka"", a centuries-old tribal war dance, to salute and honor them. A 21-gun salute was also sounded.
Meghan wore a brown chequered coat and a simple black dress, while Harry was in a dark gray suit. Both had remembrance poppy pins on their chests.
Later, Harry and Meghan visited Pukeahu National War Memorial Park to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior and visited the UK Memorial.
A large crowed gathered to catch a glimpse Queen Elizabeth's grandson and his wife and the couple spent time meeting and shaking hands with cheering fans before leaving.
The pair flew from Australia on Sunday after closing the Invictus Games in Sydney last night and were accompanied by several Invictus Games athletes from New Zealand.
The Invictus Games are an international paralympic-style competition for military personnel wounded in action that was founded by Harry.
On Sunday evening, the couple will attend a reception celebrating the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage. New Zealand became the first country in the world where women could vote in parliamentary elections in 1893.

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chances of Brazil's leftist presidential candidate Fernando Haddad narrowing the lead of right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro took a hit when he failed to win a crucial endorsement on Saturday, a day before the two face off in a runoff election. 
However, polls published late Saturday from Brazil's two biggest surveying firms showed momentum shifting toward Haddad, though he still trails Bolsonaro by a solid margin. 
Former center-left candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video on social media that he would not take sides in the election campaign, withholding support for Haddad of the Workers Party (PT).
Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in the northeast, is influential in Brazil's poorest region. His endorsement could have given Haddad a big lift in the South American country's most polarized election in a generation.
But Rodrigo Janot, Brazil's influential former prosecutor general under whose watch the country's unprecedented investigations and prosecutions of endemic political graft took place, tweeted late Saturday that he would vote for Haddad. That was a blow to Bolsonaro's work positioning himself as the only anti-corruption candidate.
""I think we are at the brink of a process that could push our democracy beyond its limits,"" Janot told Reuters late Saturday. ""Freedom, equality and fraternity - always and at any cost."" 
MOMENTUM IN POLLS
Haddad narrowed Bolsonaro's lead to 8 percentage points in an Ibope poll released late Saturday, a survey that gave him 46 percent compared with Bolsonaro's 54 percent. 
As only two candidates remain and those figures discard voters who say they will annul their votes, that in practice means Haddad needs to win 5 percentage points to overtake the right-winger. 
In a Datafolha poll also released late Saturday, Bolsonaro had 55 percent of voter backing, compared with 45 percent for Haddad. 
While Haddad failed to get Gomes to endorse him, he won the backing on Saturday not just of Janot but of Brazil's most popular YouTube host, Felipe Neto, who has 27.7 million followers on his channel. A popular anti-corruption judge, Joaquim Barbosa, who jailed several top PT leaders for corruption, also came out for Haddad.
Gomes finished third in the Oct. 7 first round vote with 12 percent of the vote, behind Bolsonaro's 46 percent and Haddad's 29 percent. Gomes had hoped to be the standard bearer of the left but was outmaneuvered by jailed PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption and anointed Haddad as his stand-in.
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, is poised to become Brazil's first far-right president since the end of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. The 63-year-old seven-term congressman has promised to crack down on crime and corruption, pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate for voters fed up with political graft and violent crime.
Bolsonaro's sudden rise comes as Brazil finds itself in its worst recession and embroiled in its biggest corruption scandal after the leftist PT ran the government for 13 of the last 15 years.
Until his presidential run, Bolsonaro was best known for defending the former military regime and its use of torture. He has faced charges for misogynist, racist and homophobic rants. 
The Supreme Court rejected the racism charge, but has not ruled on a charge of inciting to rape in a case in which he told a fellow lawmaker she was not pretty enough to rape. He called the case political persecution.
'SWEETENING' BOLSONARO
A week ago, Bolsonaro vowed to run all the ""red"" leftists out of Brazil or put them in jail, harsh words that probably contributed to the narrowing of his lead.
YouTuber Neto said he had been neutral until that point. ""Everything changed when (Bolsonaro) said he will sweep opponents out of the country or into jail. In 16 years of PT I have been robbed, but never threatened,"" Neto said by Twitter.
In the final two days of campaigning, Bolsonaro has sounded more moderate in his statements, backing down on a plan to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change accord.
On Friday he told Xingú tribes people they had a right to charge royalties for mining and hydro electric power generation on their reservations, a proposal welcomed by some natives but rejected by anthropologists and environmentalists who see the tribes as the last guardians of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and its biodiversity.
""You are as Brazilian as any of us,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I want you to have the right to use your land and exploit its biodiversity and mineral riches.""

In his final hours of campaigning in Sao Paulo, Haddad accused the Bolsonaro camp of ""sweetening"" their candidate to make him appear what he is not. ""He is a truculent and dangerous person, and that's how he should be presented to the nation,"" he said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A major meeting of Catholic bishops ended on Saturday with a call for women to play a greater role in Church decision making as a ""duty of justice"", but appeared to water down language that would have been more welcoming to gays.
The role of women took center stage at the synod, which was focused on reaching out to young people but has been overshadowed by the scandal over sex abuse in the Church and acrimony between social conservatives and reformers.
In a sign of the divisions, the synod used what appeared to be compromise language on the topic of homosexuality, saying people could not be identified solely by sexual orientation.
A working paper for the gathering, which began on Oct. 3, had used the acronym LGBT, but this did not appear in the 60-page final document.
The document also called for stricter measures to combat sexual abuse, including more transparency in Church structures, and denounced a culture of elitism among some Church leaders which it said can facilitate cover-up and corruption.
All three issues were among the subjects debated at the gathering, officially titled ""Young People, Faith and Discernment of Vocation"" and attended by some 300 bishops, priests, nuns and lay participants.
Only ""synod fathers"", including bishops and some other male representatives, were allowed to vote on the final document. It will be sent to the pope, who will take it into consideration when he writes his own document.
Attention was drawn to the issue of women's rights by the synod's own rules, under which two non-ordained monks who lead religious orders were permitted to vote, while a nun with a similar role was not. [L8N1X366M]
The Catholic Church restricts the priesthood to men, but allows people of both sexes who are not priests to hold positions of authority in other areas. However, none of the Vatican's 60 departments is headed by a women and only six women hold decision making roles in the Vatican bureaucracy.
Young people, the document said, believed the Church still lagged in attempts to give women ""space in decision making processes"" in jobs not restricted to priests.
CHANGE UNAVOIDABLE
""The synod recommends making everyone (in the Church) aware of the urgency of an unavoidable change ...,"" the document says.
It called for ""a female presence in church roles at all levels, even in positions of responsibility,"" which it described as a ""duty of justice"".
The three sections on sexuality in the document were not as strong or as inclusive as some young people had wanted, although it renewed the Church's ""commitment against all sexually-based discrimination and violence"".
The acronym LGBT appeared for the first time in a Vatican document in the working paper for synod issued in May. That working paper said: ""Some LGBT youths wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church.""
But conservative bishops, including those from Africa and at least one from the United States, opposed the mention.
""There is no such thing as an 'LGBTQ Catholic' or a 'transgender Catholic' or a 'heterosexual Catholic,' as if our sexual appetites defined who we are ...,"" Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said in his address to the synod.
The Church teaches that having homosexual urges is not sinful but people must not act on them.

In its sections on sexual abuse scandals that have scarred the Church in a number of countries, the document called for ""strong preventive measures to prevent any repeat"" and supported calls for a stricter selection of men who want to be priests.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Two former foreign ministers are the frontrunners when Georgians vote for president on Sunday, including a former French career diplomat who would be the first female leader of an ex-Soviet state outside the Baltics.
The ruling Georgian Dream party is backing Salome Zurabishvili, 66, who was born to Georgian emigre parents in France and who served as French ambassador to Georgia before becoming Georgia's foreign minister from 2004-2005.
Supporters say she would bring international stature to the presidency; opponents criticize her for statements that appeared to blame Georgia for war with Russia in 2008, remarks about minorities that some saw as xenophobic, and unsteady command of the Georgian language, which she speaks with an accent.
Her main opponent, Grigol Vashadze, 60, is running on behalf of a new platform of 11 opposition parties led by former president Mikheil Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM). He held the post of foreign minister from 2008-2012.
Georgian Dream says it believes Zurabishvili can secure more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round to be elected without a run-off. Other polls suggest a closer race likely to require a second round.
Constitutional changes have weakened the power of Georgia's presidency, putting most authority in the office of prime minister.
But the post is still seen as important for the image abroad of a country strongly oriented toward the West and fearful of Russia, which invaded a decade ago and backs separatists in two breakaway regions.
Sunday's election will also be the last in which the president is selected by popular vote; after that, presidents will be picked by an electoral college of 300 lawmakers and regional officials.
Zurabishvili was invited into Georgian politics by Saakishvili, who gave her Georgian citizenship to take up the foreign ministry post but sacked her after a year.
She then set up her own opposition political party, Georgia's Way, which she led until 2010 before temporarily quitting politics and returning to France. She was elected to Georgia's parliament in 2016 with the backing of Georgian Dream, a party controlled by Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, whose critics say he rules it from behind the scenes.
The country of 3.7 million people is Washington's strategic ally in the Caucasus region between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and hopes eventually to join the EU and NATO. Pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to Europe run across its territory.
The two frontrunners are followed by David Bakradze, a former parliamentary speaker, who has been nominated by the opposition European Georgia Party, which split from the UNM in 2017.

Twenty-two other candidates lag far behind the leading three.

ARRIAGA, Mexico (Reuters) - A U.S.-bound caravan of Central American migrants pressed on through southern Mexico on Saturday, in spite of government offers of jobs, as authorities stepped up efforts to disperse the convoy that has angered U.S. President Donald Trump.
Mexican police in riot gear briefly blocked the march of men, women and children as they neared Oaxaca state before dawn, to relay the offer of temporary identification papers, jobs or education for those seeking asylum in Mexico.
Trump has threatened to send troops to the U.S. border and cut aid to Central America to try to stop the group of several thousand people that left Honduras two weeks ago.
Estimates vary significantly on the group's size, which has morphed as some migrants return home and newcomers join. At least 150 migrants traveling separately were detained by Friday near Guatemala's border, a Mexican official said.
More than 1,700 people in the convoy have applied for asylum, while others have returned home, according to Mexico's government. The Honduran ambassador said on Friday the group officially had 3,500 members. Other estimates go much higher.
By Saturday, more than 100 Honduran migrants opted to seek refugee status and enter the temporary work program proposed by President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday, said Mexico's National Migration Institute. Many others rejected the offer.
""We're going to the United States. Because that's our dream,"" said 28-year-old Honduran Daniel Leonel Esteves at the head of a 50-person wide column of migrants snaking down a highway into the hills.
Others echoed his goal to cross the border, declining Mexico's offer.
""Our destination is the United States,"" said migrant Francisco Ramirez.
A police official on a road just south of Oaxaca, where migrants were proceeding north from the town of Arriaga in Chiapas state, said authorities intended to keep presenting the asylum offer.
""We think it's very important that every person in the caravan knows these benefits, so that they stop putting their safety at risk crossing these roads,"" said federal police commissioner Benjamin Grajeda.
Trump and his fellow Republicans have sought to make the migrant caravan and immigration major issues before the Nov. 6 elections, in which Republicans are battling to keep control of Congress.
Honduras said 4,500 of its citizens attempting to emigrate have returned to the country in recent days.

Michael D. Higgins, a left-wing former arts minister who enjoyed the support of three of the four largest political parties, easily won re-election to the largely ceremonial role with 56 percent of the vote, the electoral commission said.
Media coverage had focused on the surge in support for independent businessman Peter Casey, who came second with 23 percent of the vote, up from 2 percent in an opinion poll just days earlier.
Commentators linked the surge to his comments on Irish Travellers, one of the most marginalized groups in society, who he said did not pay their fair share of taxes and generally camped on other people's land.
Traveller advocacy group Pavee Point said the surge should send out a warning to the Irish political system, one of the few in Europe that has not experienced a surge in far-right political parties in recent years.
""It is important that we also do not gloss over the fact that one candidate sought to exploit prejudice against a small and marginalized community,"" the group said in a statement welcoming Higgins' re-election.
Casey on Saturday told journalists he did not believe the comments were responsible for the surge in support and said they could not be racist as he did not regard Travellers as a different race.
Irish voters also looked set to remove the offense of blasphemy from the constitution in a referendum held alongside the election. Exit polls and early results indicated the measure had been backed by more than two-thirds of voters.
It is currently illegal to publish or speak of anything ""grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion"".
The exit polls are the latest sign of the waning influence of the Catholic religion in Ireland, five months after voters overwhelmingly backed a bid to overturn a ban on abortion.
An attempt to charge British broadcaster Stephen Fry last year for referring to god as ""capricious, mean-minded (and) stupid"" was dropped last year. One police source told the Irish Independent the case was abandoned because they failed to find ""a substantial number of outraged people"" as required by law.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - A gunman yelling, “All Jews must die,” stormed a Pittsburgh synagogue during Saturday services, killing at least eight worshippers and wounding six others, including four police officers, before he was arrested.
CNN reported at least 10 dead, while the Washington Post put the death toll at 11. A federal law enforcement official had told Reuters earlier that at least 8 people were killed.
""It's a very horrific crime scene, one of the worst that I've seen,"" Pittsburgh public safety director Wendell Hissrich told a news conference near the scene.
""This falls under hate crime,"" he said, adding there was no active threat to the community and that the shooter had been taken to a hospital.
KDKA television cited police sources as saying the gunman walked into the building and yelled “All Jews must die.” 
Three police officers were shot and one was injured by shrapnel, Alleghany County spokeswoman Amie Downs said in an email. Two of the six people injured were in critical condition, Downs said, but would not immediately say if the count of six injured people included the suspect. 
Authorities and elected officials were expected to provide more details at a 4 p.m. (2000 GMT) news conference. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will lead the probe into the attack.
Two sources identified the suspect as a 46-year-old Pittsburgh man, Robert Bowers. 
A social media post by Bowers said a Jewish refugee organization, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, ""likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” 
The comment was posted on Gab, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based social networking service created as an alternative to Twitter. In a statement, Gab.com confirmed the profile belonged to Bowers.
""Gab took swift and proactive action to contact law enforcement immediately,"" it said. ""We first backed up all user data from the account and then proceeded to suspend the account. We then contacted the FBI and made them aware of this account and the user data in our possession."" 
The shooting, for which one federal law enforcement official said Bowers used an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, prompted security alerts at houses of worship around the country. It follows a spate of pipe bombs found mailed in recent days to prominent political figures, mostly Democrats including former President Barack Obama.
The Tree of Life synagogue in the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a heavily Jewish area, was holding a Shabbat religious service at the time of the shooting. 
Police are normally only present at the synagogue for security on high holidays, Michael Eisenberg, former president of the synagogue, told KDKA. 
""On a day like today, the door is open, it’s a religious service, you can walk in and out,"" he said.
Around the time, three congregations amounting to about 100 people would have been using the building, Eisenberg said. Most of the congregants were older people, according to a former rabbi interviewed by local media. 
Shortly after reports of the shooting emerged, U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet he was watching what he described as a ""devastating"" situation. 
Trump told reporters later that the killings might have been prevented if there had been an armed guard in the building. 
“If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a much more different situation, they didn’t,"" he said when asked about a possible link to U.S. gun laws.
DEADLY ANTI-SEMITISM
Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said, ""This is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States.""
On April 13, 2014, a pair of shootings occurred at a Jewish Community Center and a Jewish retirement community, both located in Overland Park, Kansas. A total of three people were killed in the shootings.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was heartbroken, describing the attack as ""horrendous anti-Semitic brutality.""
French President Emmanuel Macron said, ""I want to express our sadness and support to the American people."" 
France is home to western Europe's biggest Jewish population and many in the 400,000-strong community have complained for years of a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes. 
In 2015, vandals desecrated 250 tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France days after four Jews were killed in an attack on a kosher grocery in Paris.
In the United States that year, a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans during a prayer service in Charleston, South Carolina. 

In 2012, a neo-Nazi gunman with white supremacist ties walked into a Sikh gurdwara - or house of worship - in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and murdered six Sikh Americans.

""Daesh terrorists continue to launch counter attacks, taking advantage of the bad weather conditions.... Due to fierce clashes 14 of our fighters were martyred,"" Kino Gibrail, the spokesman said in a statement. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. 
Several other SDF fighters were wounded in the clashes which began on Friday and were still ongoing on Saturday evening, the statement added. It said U.S-led coalition forces had supported the SDF in fending off the Islamic State attack, and heavy losses were inflicted on the Islamists.
The SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia, is the main ally on the ground of the United States and its coalition partners. Over the past two years, the SDF has helped drive Islamic State fighters from nearly all cities and towns the militants controlled in their self-declared caliphate in Syria.
The SDF now controls a swathe of territory in the north and east of Syria, the largest part of the country outside government control, while largely avoiding direct confrontation with Damascus in the multi-sided war.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, reported that 68 SDF fighters were killed in the clash with Islamic State, including a high ranking officer. More than a hundred others were injured.
Around 2,000 U.S. special forces troops are believed to be on the ground in Syria, where they have aided the SDF.

Rouhani was speaking at the start of a parliament session to discuss a cabinet reshuffle which includes a proposed new economy minister, academic Farhad Dejpasand, who is widely seen as a technocrat, and three other economy-linked ministers. 
""It does not happen often that the U.S. makes a decision and its traditional allies abandon it,"" Rouhani told parliament in a speech carried live on state television.
Washington reintroduced sanctions against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after it pulled out from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. 
European countries have criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the accord and have been putting together a package of economic measures to help offset the impact of U.S. pressures on Tehran's economy. 
U.S. curbs on Iran’s vital oil exports are set to come into force on Nov. 4. 
""Our main enemy, America, faces us with a drawn sword and we have to fight it and we have to unite. Regardless of factions ... we are all part of the Iranian nation,"" Rouhani said, urging MPs to vote for his proposed ministers.
""Part of our economic problems has to do with the (high) rate of exchange of hard currencies, but our foreign exchange reserves are better than in any of the past five years,"" he said, without giving figures. 
The proposed cabinet changes come as the government faces intense pressure over the economic instability mostly caused by the U.S. sanctions. 
The economy has markedly deteriorated in the past year, suffering rising inflation and unemployment, a 70-percent fall in the value of the rial currency so far this year and state corruption. 
""A year ago no one would have believed ... that Europe would stand with Iran and against America,"" Rouhani said. 
""Russia, China, India, the European Union, and some African and Latin American countries are our friends. We have to work with them and attract investments,"" he added.

The official Korean Central News Agency quoted the director of the Pyongyang Friendship Hospital as saying on Saturday that recent reports about the fate of 22-year-old Otto Warmbier, who died days after he was returned to the United States in a coma, were a ""total distortion of the truth.""
""The American doctors who came ... to help Warmbier's repatriation acknowledged that his health indicators were all normal and submitted a letter of assurance to our hospital that they shared the diagnostic result of the doctors of our hospital,"" KCNA quoted the unnamed director as saying.
""Now the question is: what is the ulterior motive of those American doctors trying to make a different story at this point in time with regard to the cause of Warmbier's death,"" the report said, adding that medical assessments ""should not be influenced by any selfish purpose or political interest.""
It added that Warmbier's ""health indicators were all normal"" at the time of his release and there should instead be an investigation into the cause of his sudden death after his arrival in the United States. 
The KCNA report came hours after the Korean service of the Voice of America radio station carried a report on a lawsuit filed by Warmbier's parents alleging that their son was tortured in detention.
VOA quoted declarations filed in support of the suit by Otto Warmbier's former dentists as saying that there was evidence of trauma to his teeth. 
It quoted another declaration from Daniel Kanter, a neurologist who was the lead physician for Warmbier on his return to his home town of Cincinnati as saying that Otto suffered brain damage after a cessation of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.
""Because the injury was so extensive, it was unlikely that Mr. Warmbier was with medical personnel who were willing and able to intervene to resuscitate him when the injury occurred,” Kanter declaration was quoted as saying.
North Korea has blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill for Warmbier's condition. The coroner who examined Warmbier said he found no sign of botulism, adding there was no evidence of trauma to Warmbier's teeth or of broken bones.

U.S. President Donald Trump charged last year that Warmbier was tortured, but also held an unprecedented summit with the North Korean leader this year and is planning another aimed at persuading him to abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States.

Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after it declared independence following a referendum. Elections later returned a regional government favoring secession though a party supporting union with Spain won most votes. [nL8N1N22NS]
As separatist leaders jailed for their role in last year's attempt to split from Spain go to trial, Catalan leader Quim Torra demanded their acquittal on Saturday and said independence efforts would continue.
""Turning back is not an option,"" Torra said in a televised address, adding that he ""won't accept any sentence other than a full acquittal.""
""If there's a conviction, we'll face it with the determination of Oct. 1 and the strength and solidarity of Oct. 3,"" Torra said, referring to the date of last year's referendum and a general strike held two days later.
Protest rallies were due to take place later on Saturday in towns and cities across the region.
Catalans in the referendum voted overwhelmingly for independence with those opposed to independence largely boycotting the vote. 
Opinion polls show that the region is split roughly in half between those who support secession and those favoring remaining part of Spain.
Despite continued friction between Barcelona and Madrid, tensions have dropped considerably since last year.

In a sign of frustration at the lack of progress towards secession, members of one pro-independence civil society group submitted a petition on Saturday calling for the Catalan parliament and regional government to publish the declaration of the Catalan republic in the official Catalan bulletin.

Ankara, which has long backed rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, and Moscow, Assad's principal foreign ally, brokered the deal last month to create a demilitarized zone in the northwest Idlib region.
Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of the rebels, who rose up against Assad in 2011. The area is home to an estimated 3 million people, more than half of whom have already fled other areas as government forces advanced.
Shelling in Idlib killed at least seven civilians on Friday, the largest one-day loss of life there since Russian air strikes stopped in mid-August, a war monitor said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Erdogan are due to have four-way talks in Istanbul on Saturday. Putin spoke ahead of the summit by phone to Macron and Erdogan.
U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is stepping down at the end of next month for family reasons, is also taking part.

Under their deal last month, Turkey and Russia agreed to set up a buffer zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) into rebel territory that had to be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadist fighters.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia says it is beacon of 'light' against Iran despite Khashoggi crisis,"By Katie Paul and Idrees Ali
MANAMA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and key ally Bahrain said on Saturday that Gulf states are playing a critical role in maintaining stability in the Middle East by combating Iran's ""vision of darkness"", as Riyadh faces its worst political crisis in decades.
Saudi Arabia is the lynchpin of a U.S.-backed regional bloc against growing Iranian influence in the Middle East but the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. has prompted a global outcry and strained Riyadh's ties with the West. 
""We are now dealing with two visions in the Middle East. One is a (Saudi) vision of light ... One is a (Iranian) vision of darkness which seeks to spread sectarianism throughout the region,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a security summit in Bahrain.
""History tells us that light always wins out against the dark ... The question is how do we defeat them.""
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that the killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policy, undermined regional stability and that Washington would take additional measures against those responsible after announcing visa bans on 21 suspects in the case.
""Failure of any one nation to adhere to international norms and the rule of law undermines regional stability at a time when it is needed most,"" Mattis told a separate session of the annual Manama Dialogue security conference.
The long-planned event has been the focus of greater scrutiny this year after the killing of Khashoggi, with Jubeir questioned about how the case would affect Saudi Arabia's credibility on foreign policy and security matters.
He reiterated that Riyadh would bring to justice those responsible for Khashoggi's death, saying they would be prosecuted in the kingdom, a day after Turkey demanded the extradition of 18 Saudis suspected of involvement in his murder.
Jubeir said ties between Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, and the United States are ""ironclad"" and praised what he described as the ""rational, realistic"" foreign policy of the current U.S. administration.
President Donald Trump has said he wants to get to the bottom of the Khashoggi case, while also highlighting Riyadh's role as an ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms. 
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which was not represented in the Manama conference agenda, have long been locked in a proxy war, competing for regional supremacy from Iraq to Syria and Lebanon to Yemen. 
Trump, who in May withdraw the United States from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran, has strongly backed Saudi Arabia in its efforts to counter Iran's influence. The next wave of U.S. sanctions against Iran are due to come into effect on Nov 4.
Iran, for its part, accuses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of funding gunmen who attacked a military parade in Iran last month, killing 25 people, 12 of them members of the elite Revolutionary Guards. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have denied any involvement.
The Guards accused them of creating ""plots and tensions"".
SECURITY ALLIANCE
Bahrain's foreign minister, Shiekh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, told the conference the Gulf bloc would remain a ""pillar"" of regional security and that a proposed security alliance grouping the United States, Gulf states, Jordan and Egypt would be activated next year.
The Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) is meant to serve as a bulwark against Iran and extremism, Washington says. But there has been uncertainty about how it can get off the ground given a protracted dispute between Qatar and four Arab states led by Saudi Arabia who launched a boycott of Doha in 2017.
Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing their archrival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott impinges on its sovereignty.
Mattis said that it was important to end the 16-month-old Arab dispute with Qatar that analysts say has weakened regional coordination against Iran. 
Jubeir said recent discussions in Saudi Arabia about a framework for MESA included Qatari officials and that the proposed alliance would not be affected by the diplomatic row.
""It (MESA) is an alliance for security and prosperity for the region and will be open to those who accept its principles,"" Sheikh Khalid said, adding that the alliance would also cooperate on economic issues.
Gulf Arab foreign ministers also touched on Middle East peace initiatives, with Sheikh Khalid lauding efforts by Oman, which hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday in a rare visit.
Oman's foreign minister, Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, told the forum that Muscat was offering ideas to help Israel and the Palestinians to come together but was not acting as mediator.

Critics say the city has been in decline for years and accuse Mayor Virginia Raggi, who took office in 2016, of failing to fulfill campaign promises to clean up the mess.
""We're here because Rome deserves better, because Rome is in a state of neglect the like of which has never been seen before,"" said Marita Monaco, 57, who took part in the protest in a Renaissance square designed by Michelangelo.
""It is a city in disarray, where there are no more rules or social cohesion,"" she added.
Raggi is a member of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and was swept to power following a wave of public disgust over corruption scandals that had battered previous administrations run by both traditional left- and right-wing parties.
The first female mayor in the history of the city, Raggi says she needs more time to overcome Rome's myriad problems, but argues that she is already making good progress. 
Her critics say things are getting worse, not better.
A strike by rubbish collectors has left many trash cans overflowing, potholes riddle the roads, while the local transport system is in permanent crisis.
More than 20 buses have caught fire on the streets of the city so far this year, largely the result of poor maintenance, while a broken escalator injured more than 20 Russian soccer fans at a city metro station last Tuesday.
The death this week of a 16-year girl, whose body was found in an abandoned building used by drug dealers, underscored fears about law and order in the city. Police say they believe the girl was gang-raped and have arrested four migrants.
Under the hashtag #romadicebasta (""Rome says enough"") residents’ associations and civil society groups banded together to organize Saturday's protest, which Reuters reporters estimated drew between 5,000-8,000 people.
""Rome has become an open sewer, a scandal, full of rats, foxes, wild boar and rubbish,"" said Rome resident Salvatore Golino. ""We are drowning in trash and we can't take it anymore.""
A recent video that went viral online showed a family of boar foraging through sacks of rubbish on a city street. Another video earlier this year showed a large boar running up a major city road under the gaze of astonished drivers.
Raggi is standing trial for alleged abuse of office over a contested appointment within her administration. She has denied the accusation, but has said she will resign if found guilty. 
A verdict is due on Nov. 10 and Raggi's administration would fall if she left office, potentially opening the way for fresh elections.

MANAMA (Reuters) - Oman described Israel as an accepted Middle East state on Saturday, a day after hosting a surprise visit by its prime minister that Washington said could help regional peace efforts.
Oman is offering ideas to help Israel and the Palestinians to come together but is not acting as mediator, Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the sultanate’s minister responsible for foreign affairs, told a security summit in Bahrain.
""Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this,"" bin Alawi said.
""The world is also aware of this fact. Maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as others states] and also bear the same obligations.""
His comments followed a rare visit to Oman by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which came days after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas paid a three-day visit to the Gulf country. Both leaders met with Oman's Sultan Qaboos. 
""We are not saying that the road is now easy and paved with flowers, but our priority is to put an end to the conflict and move to a new world,"" bin Alawi told the summit.
Oman is relying on the United States and efforts by President Donald Trump in working toward the ""deal of the century"" (Middle East peace), he added.
Bahrain's foreign minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa voiced support for Oman over the sultanate's role in trying to secure Israeli-Palestinian peace, while Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said the kingdom believes the key to normalizing relations with Israel was the peace process. 
The three-day summit was attended by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and his counterparts in Italy and Germany also participated, but Jordan's King Abdullah canceled his appearance after a flood that hit the Dead Sea region killed 21 people.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt welcomed the ""warming ties & growing cooperation between our regional friends"" in a tweet late on Friday.
""This is a helpful step for our peace efforts & essential to create an atmosphere of stability, security & prosperity between Israelis, Palestinians & their neighbors. Looking forward to seeing more meetings like this!” Greenblatt said.
CURBING IRAN 
Israel and some Gulf states share an interest in curbing Iran's influence in the region.
Oman has long been to the Middle East what neutral Switzerland is to global diplomacy. The country helped to mediate secret U.S.-Iran talks in 2013 that led to the historic nuclear deal signed in Geneva two years later.
Earlier this year, bin Alawi visited Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque and Netanyahu has on several occasions hinted at warmer ties with Gulf states. 
He told Israel's parliament last week that due to fears of a nuclear threat from Iran, ""Israel and other Arab countries are closer than they ever were before.""
Though uncommon, Israeli leaders have previously visited the Gulf state. 
In 1996, the late Shimon Peres went to Oman and Qatar when he was prime minister and opened Israel trade representative offices in both Gulf countries. 
His predecessor, the late Yitzhak Rabin, made the first trip to Oman in 1994.

On his visit on Friday, Netanyahu was accompanied by senior officials, including the head of the Mossad intelligence agency and his national security adviser.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 06:54AM ET</span>",More violence feared as Brazil braces for far-right presidency,"By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - After a presidential campaign that has seen political violence overshadow policy debate, many Brazilians fear attacks will continue after the likely election on Sunday of tough-talking far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro's supporters in recent weeks have threatened to harm Supreme Court justices and physically attacked journalists and opposition voters.
There has also been violence attributed to backers of Bolsonaro's opponent, Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party (PT), but to a far lesser extent. 
Brazil's tense political climate has been compared by some to divisions in the United States, where several high-profile opponents of President Donald Trump received pipe bombs in the mail this week.
But the situation in Brazil, is far more perilous, analysts say, because it already suffers from extreme violence, often without consequence for perpetrators. 
Nearly 64,000 murders were registered last year, but less than 10 percent of homicide cases result in charges, according to government data. 
Bolsonaro, who maintains a double-digit lead in all polls, himself suffered a near-fatal stabbing during a campaign rally last month. 
He is still recovering, but the episode only reinforced his aggressive rhetoric, combining verbal attacks on political foes with vows to violently combat crime and pursue graft cases against opponents.
""You PT crew, you'll have the civil and military police with legal support to bring the law down on your backs,"" he said in a video broadcast to supporters at demonstrations last Sunday. ""These delinquent Reds will be banned from our homeland."" 
He says he does not condone violence carried out by his supporters, but analysts say his daily rants on social media platforms are taking a toll.
""Bolsonaro, because of his rhetoric supporting violence and the aggressive manner he has campaigned, has opened the Pandora's box on political violence in an already extremely violent country,"" said Rafael Alcadipani, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation university in Sao Paulo.
""If people thought Brazil had extremely high levels of street violence in normal times, imagine what it will be like under a president who aggressively pushes violence among police and against political opponents?"" 
TARGETING JOURNALISTS
Bolsonaro's attacks on the media over aggressive reporting that he calls ""fake news"" have also sent a chill through newsrooms which have dealt with a surge in threats and physical violence.
Brazilian investigative journalism group Abraji said since January 64 reporters who cover the campaign have been physically attacked and another 82 targeted in online hate campaigns. 
By comparison, 40 U.S.-based journalists covering all topics were physically attacked during that period, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker database run by over two dozen press freedom groups. 
Bolsonaro supporters were blamed for most of the attacks in Brazil, Abraji said, while PT backers were responsible for a smaller fraction.
Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil's biggest newspaper, has been flooded with threats, including ones targeting the six-year-old son of a reporter who uncovered alleged illegalities in the Bolsonaro campaign's use of WhatsApp to spread misinformation.
Federal police are investigating a retired Army colonel who has made repeated threats against Supreme Court judges in widely shared videos, warning them not to rule against Bolsonaro. The man is now wearing an electronic ankle bracelet so authorities can monitor his whereabouts.
Supreme Court Justice Carmen Lucia said the attacks were a threat against democracy, saying this week that ""aggressions that target any justice are attacks on the entire court as an institution."" 
ROUGH RHETORIC 
Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former army captain, is an ardent supporter of Brazil's 1964-85 military regime and cites one of the period's most notorious torturers, Colonel Carlos Ustra, as a personal hero. 
As president, he says he would encourage police to kill suspected criminals with abandon. He wants to loosen gun controls so civilians can defend themselves and at times he suggests violence can solve Brazil's political problems too.
In one campaign rally, he grabbed a cameraman's tripod, shouldered it like a rifle and yelled into a microphone that ""we are going to gun down all these Workers Party supporters!"" 
His campaign says his rhetoric simply veers into politically incorrect jokes meant to irritate his leftist presidential rival Fernando Haddad.
Bolsonaro has won over tens of millions of Brazilian voters with his inflammatory, anti-establishment stance, citizens who are sick of being the targets of rampant street crime and endemic political corruption he vows to eradicate.
Matheus Ferreira, an 18-year-old snack stand vendor in Sao Paulo who hails from a violent slum, said the tense situation fills him with fear, but not much beyond what he faces daily. 
""I will vote for Bolsonaro,"" he said this week. ""If he can make Brazil safer, he would have been worth the risk.""

428,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 06:19AM ET</span>",Palestinian militants agree truce after exchange of fire with Israel,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Maayan Lubell
GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian militants said on Saturday they would halt attacks into Israel from the Gaza Strip after they fired the heaviest rocket salvoes across the border since August.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the armed groups that operates in Gaza, said it fired the rockets in retaliation for Israel's killing of four Palestinian protesters on Friday.
Israel in response struck dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
A spokesman for the militants said an Egyptian-mediated truce had been reached.
""After contacts between the Islamic Jihad leadership and the brothers in Egypt it was agreed that a comprehensive ceasefire will begin immediately,"" spokesman Daoud Shehab said. ""The Islamic Jihad will abide by the ceasefire if the occupation (Israel) does the same.""
Egyptian security officials have been talking separately to Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an attempt to restore calm along the border.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined comment on Shehab's remarks and there was no immediate response from other Israeli officials. Israel rarely acknowledges it has reached a truce with Gaza's militant groups which it designates as terrorist organizations.
Earlier, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus accused Syria and Iran of involvement in the rocket attack.
""Orders and incentives were given from Damascus with a clear involvement of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force,"" Conricus told reporters. ""Our response is not limited geographically.""
Israel regularly accuses Iran of aiding Gaza militants, but rarely levels the charge in connection with a specific rocket attack.
WEEKLY PROTESTS
Shehab dismissed the allegation as ""an Israeli attempt to escape its responsibility"" for Friday's protest deaths.
There were no casualties reported from the heavy exchange of fire in either Israel or Gaza, which is controlled by the Islamist Hamas group.
The Israeli military said it holds Hamas accountable for the events in Gaza. It said its air force hit more than 80 targets including one used by Hamas as a headquarters, in response to more than 30 rockets launched into Israel. There was no immediate comment from Hamas.
The flare-up began after the four Palestinians were killed on Friday during weekly protests. Israel said its forces were attacked with explosive devices and some demonstrators breached the border. 
Palestinians have been protesting along the frontier since March 30, demanding an end to an Israeli blockade and the right to return to lands from which they fled or were driven from when Israel was founded in 1948.
According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 213 Gazans have been killed by Israeli forces during the protests. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper.
About two million Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip which is in a deep economic crisis. Israel says it keeps a naval blockade and tight control of its land crossings with the enclave for security reasons.
Israel has struck scores of times inside Syria during the seven-year civil war there, at what it has said were Iranian targets or Teheran's transfers of weapons to Hezbollah fighters.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Oman on Friday. Israel and some Gulf states share an interest in curbing Iran's influence in the region. 
Oman's foreign affairs minister Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah said on Saturday the sultanate was offering ideas to help Israel and the Palestinians come together but was not acting as mediator.

Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014.

In Asia's first such ruling, Taiwan's constitutional court declared in May last year that same-sex couples had the right to legally marry, and set a two-year deadline for legalization.
But the self-ruled island will hold a series of public votes on same-sex marriage on November 24, after its election authority approved separate referendum petitions from both conservative and rights groups.
The move has revived a debate over a possible separate law for civil unions between gay couples and presents a challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen, who rights activists say has made little progress on the issue despite campaigning on a promise of marriage equality in the run-up to elections in 2016.
The 16th annual parade in Taipei, the largest of its kind in East Asia, featured colorful costumes, musical performances and rainbow flags as protesters gathered near the Presidential Office. 
Many called the proposal to make a separate law for gay marriage ""discriminatory"", citing the 2017 ruling that current laws violate the right to freedom of marriage and equality.
Carrying banners that said ""vote for your happy future,"" the marchers shouted ""defeat discrimination"".
""We will use our vote to tell Tsai Ing-wen's government that people want marriage equality,"" said Miao Poya, who joined the parade and was one of the activists who proposed a referendum in favor of same-sex marriage. 
Organizers said some 137,000 attended the Saturday parade. 
Society is still divided on same-sex marriage, Tsai said this year, but the government would abide by the constitutional court ruling of May 2017.

The public votes will coincide with mayoral and magisterial elections on the democratic island, which is seen as a beacon of liberalism in the region.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 05:41AM ET</span>",Mattis says Khashoggi killing undermines regional stability,"By Idrees Ali
MANAMA (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi undermined Middle Eastern stability and that Washington would take additional measures against those responsible.
Washington Post columnist Khashoggi's murder has escalated into a crisis for the world’s top oil exporter. Saudi Arabia's allies have reacted with outrage toward a country that is the lynchpin of a U.S.-backed regional bloc against growing Iranian influence in the Middle East.
But Mattis also said U.S. respect for the Saudi people was undiminished, while Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said those behind the killing would be prosecuted in the kingdom and that the investigation would take time.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to get to the bottom of the case, while also highlighting Riyadh's role as an ally against Tehran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.
""With our collective interests in peace and unwavering respect for human rights in mind, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in a diplomatic facility must concern us all greatly,"" Mattis told a conference in Bahrain.
""Failure of any one nation to adhere to international norms and the rule of law undermines regional stability at a time when it is needed most,"" Mattis said. He did not mention de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by name at any point.
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said Khashoggi's killing was premeditated, contradicting a previous official statement that it happened accidentally during a tussle in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 
Saudi officials have also said he was accidentally killed in a botched security operation to return him to the kingdom.
In his remarks at the Manama Dialogue security conference, Mattis went through a list of what he described as disruptive Iranian behavior - a message most Gulf allies will view positively since they share similar concerns about Iran's increasing influence in Syria and Iraq.
While these were some of the sharpest comments Mattis has made on the Khashoggi killing, he also said the two countries still needed to collaborate on stability in the region.
""It's hard to imagine that this administration in particular is going to change fundamentally how it views the role of the Saudis in terms of counterterrorism, in terms of counter-Iran,"" said Dennis Ross, who served as top Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama in his first term.
Foreign Minister Jubeir, speaking at the same conference, said Riyadh's relations with Washington were ""ironclad"" amid what he called ""hysteria in the media"" over Khashoggi's killing.
In response to the killing, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week announced moves against 21 Saudis to either revoke their visas or make them ineligible for U.S. visas after the Khashoggi killing. 
""Our Secretary of State ...will be taking additional measures as the situation is clarified,"" Mattis said.
ALLIANCES
Mattis said the presence in the Middle East of Russia - a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - could not be a replacement for the United States, whose ""long-standing, enduring, and transparent"" commitment to the region he reiterated.
He said that it was important to end a 16-month-old dispute between Qatar and four Arab states that analysts say has weakened regional coordination against Iran.
Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing their archrival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges.
""The solving of internal debates among our GCC partners is vital for realizing this vision. Without it, we weaken our security,"" he said, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council nations. 
Mattis said he continued to support partners in the region who were defending themselves against Houthi attacks in Yemen but also called for an end to fighting there.

A Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 has conducted frequent air strikes targeting the Iran-aligned Houthi group and has often hit civilians, although it denies doing so intentionally.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday suspended parliament till Nov. 16, a day after removing Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister and replacing him with former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa in a surprise move that signals escalating political tensions in the South Asian nation.
“The president has prorogued the parliament,” cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told reporters.
Minutes earlier Wickremesinghe, who says he remains prime minister, urged the speaker to convene parliament to prove he retained his parliamentary majority.
“I have the majority in the parliament, convene the parliament to resolve this,” Wickremesinghe told a press conference in Colombo on Saturday, flanked by all his coalition partners except Sirisena’s party.
“Only parliament can show who has the majority,” he said. 
The parliament suspension means Wickremesinghe will not immediately have an opportunity to prove his majority, amid speculation that some of his party members would cross over to back Rajapaksa for perks and ministerial portfolios.
The island nation’s Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Friday condemned Rajapaksa’s appointment as “an anti-democratic coup” and violation of the constitution.
A delegation of the European Union said on Saturday that it was closely following the events in Sri Lanka. 
""We urge all parties to fully act in accordance with Sri Lanka’s constitution, to refrain from violence, to follow due institutional process, to respect the independence of institutions, and freedom of media.""
Sirisena administered the oath of office to Rajapaksa on Friday after sacking Wickremesinghe, who was away touring the south of the country. Under Sri Lanka's constitution, the prime minister heads parliament and the president has executive powers.
The political rift, which comes amid weakening economic growth in Sri Lanka, follows months of infighting in the ruling coalition.
Relations between Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) and Sirisensa’s United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) have been strained recently after Sirisensa criticized Wickremesinghe’s for not adequately investigating an assassination plot against the president. The UPFA had threatened to quit the ruling coalition.
Sirisena accused India’s intelligence services of involvement in that plot, a claim New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.
There was no immediate reaction from India which has long seen Sri Lanka, located just off its southern tip, as part of its area of influence. India's foreign ministry did not respond to a request seeking comment on the change of leadership in Sri Lanka.
India has been concerned about Rajapaksa’s wooing of China -- he ushered in billions of dollars of investment from Beijing to help rebuild the country following the end of a 26-year-long civil war against Tamil separatists in 2009. 

That investment has since put the island nation deep in debt and forced it to hand over control of a strategic southern port to China, drawing criticism from India and the United States.

""We are in close collaboration with our European allies... and we will continue to collaborate very closely with the treaty and its implications for European security,"" Mattis said in a speech in Bahrain.
""Eventually we have to look reality in the eye, that is not to mean that we are walking away from arms control. But arms control must be more than words on a paper, it must be actions,"" Mattis added.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 20 that Washington planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan had signed in 1987.
The pact eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe.
Washington has cited Russia's alleged violation of the treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies. Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact.
Gorbachev has denounced the U.S. decision to leave the INF that helped end the Cold War, saying it would heralded a new arms race which increased the risk of nuclear conflict.

The early morning bombing in Maidan Shahr, the main city of the province, some 35km (22) miles southwest of the capital Kabul, happened as policemen and civilians were going inside the base, said Hekmat Durrani, a spokesman for the police chief.
Three civilians and two policemen were among the dead, Durrani said, adding that the casualty figure could rise as policemen and first responders were busy recovering the wounded and bodies from collapsed walls and debris.
No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack but the Taliban insurgents fighting to overthrow the Western-back Kabul government has carried out some of the deadliest bombings against government installations in past years.
Strategically located along the route connecting Kabul to the southern region, Wardak is ideally placed for insurgents who control nearly mountain villages to use as a staging ground for suicide bombings inside Kabul.
The sprawling base built by the Americans, is home to hundreds of Afghan policemen from where they conduct operations in two nearby provinces.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Protesters rallied in Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, on Saturday calling for an end to the country's controversial South Pacific detention centers which house refugees who try to reach Australia by boat.
Particular focus was directed toward the wellbeing of children on the tiny island nation of Nauru, though refugee advocates said all refugees should be out of detention.
""It's kids off, everyone off and bring them here,"" Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition told Reuters on Saturday. 
More than 1,400 people are being held on the Australian-run detention centers on Nauru and Papua New Guinea, some for years.
The rally organizers said thousands attended the protests in each city, but local media had smaller estimates. There was no estimate from police. 
Australia refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach the country. It says the policy deters people smugglers in Asia from plying their trade and saves lives by stopping people sailing in unseaworthy boats from Indonesia to Australia.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is under increased pressure to immediately resettle children on Nauru, after aid agencies and doctors raising concerns of a health crisis.
Worsening mental health has left some of the children on Nauru in a ""semi-comatose state"", unable to eat, drink or talk, says humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which was ejected from Nauru by the island's government.
Morrison’s government is on the verge of losing its majority after a devastating by-election on October 20, and key independents have warned their support hinges on him freeing children on Nauru.
On Monday, 11 child migrants were evacuated from Nauru for medical treatment.
Australia first introduced offshore processing of refugees between 2001 and 2008 and started it again in 2012. In 2013 it significantly toughened the policy, ruling that even if people were found to be refugees they would never be resettled in Australia.

The royal couple watched most the wheelchair basketball final and then presented gold medals to the U.S. team which comfortably beat the Netherlands by 29 points to 17.
A large crowd had packed into Sydney's Olympic Park to watch the last day of the week-long competition, with attention only diverted from the match for a short time as the couple entered and sat with the crowd.
The Invictus Games, founded by Harry, is an international paralympic-style event for military personnel wounded in action.
Former England soccer captain David Beckham, who is an Invictus ambassador, also attended the basketball match.
Both Harry and Meghan wore remembrance poppies on their chests, with Meghan's fixed upon her maroon top.
On Saturday evening, Harry and Meghan are due to attend the closing ceremony of the event, which has seen some 500 competitors from 18 nations take part.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>","U.S. withdrawal of California gillnet protections for whales, turtles ruled illegal","By Laura Zuckerman
(Reuters) - The Trump administration unlawfully withdrew a plan to limit the number of whales, turtles and other marine creatures permitted to be inadvertently killed or harmed by drift gillnets used to catch swordfish off California, a federal judge has ruled.
The decision requires U.S. fisheries managers to take steps to implement the plan, which calls for placing numerical limits on the “bycatch” of bottlenose dolphins, four whale species and four sea turtle species snared in swordfish gillnets.
As currently written, the regulation in question also would mandate suspension of swordfish gillnet operations altogether off Southern California if any one of the bycatch limits were exceeded.
The Pacific Fishery Management Council endorsed the plan in 2015, and it was formally proposed for implementation by the U.S. Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service the following year. 
The rule was expected to gain final approval but was abruptly withdrawn instead in June 2017 under President Donald Trump, whose Commerce Department determined the cost to the commercial fishing industry outweighed conservation benefits.
The environmental group Oceana sued, accusing the Commerce Department of violating U.S. fisheries laws and the federal Administrative Procedures Act. Oceana also asked the courts to order the agency to put the bycatch limits into effect.
U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner declined to force the National Marine Fisheries Service to immediately implement the restrictions in a decision handed down Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
But he sided with environmentalists in finding the agency’s reversal exceeded its authority and was “arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of its discretion.” 
Klausner ordered federal fisheries managers to either re-issue the regulations as written or consult with the Pacific Fishery Management Council on any revisions.
Drift gillnets, consisting of mile-long (1.8 km-long) strands of nylon mesh draped 200 feet (60 meters) deep in the ocean from surface floats, pose a hazard to a wide assortment of marine mammals and turtles that can become entangled and drown. 
According to Oceana, the 20 vessels that make up the California drift gillnet fishery ended up discarding 61 percent of their catch from 2004 to 2017.
The Marine Fisheries Service said Friday it had not yet seen the judge's ruling and was unable to comment.
Oceana attorney Mariel Combs told Reuters the legal finding marked a victory for marine wildlife.
“The National Marine Fisheries Service’s decision to withdraw those important protections was irresponsible and illegal,” she said.

During two days of voting last weekend, insurgents launched some 250 attacks across the country, killing at least 50 people and wounding more than 100, the interior ministry said.
Kandahar police chief General Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan’s most feared anti-Taliban commanders, was killed two days before the elections, leaving a dangerous security vacuum.
""The security forces may not have time to regroup in the aftermath of Razeq's assassination,"" said Graeme Smith, a consultant for the International Crisis Group.
Razeq and Kandahar's intelligence agency commander were killed when a member of the provincial governor’s bodyguard opened fire on officials leaving a meeting with the U.S. commander of Afghanistan's NATO-led force, General Scott Miller.
Miller escaped unharmed, but a U.S. general was one of two Americans wounded in the attack that further weakened the hold of President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed government on security.
Thousands of soldiers were deployed on Saturday to boost the morale of voters shaken by the killing of Razeq, who was widely credited for maintaining stability across Kandahar, a hotbed of insurgency. 
Zia Durani, a spokesman for Kandahar police, said security forces were working closely to protect more than 550,000 voters expected to cast their ballot.
Security experts monitoring the polls said Razeq's killing sent shock waves through the country and there could be further attacks by the Taliban, who are seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster at the hand of U.S.-led forces.
Ghani's government named Razeq's brother as his successor after his supporters threatened to block the Kandahar vote.
Razeq's death could serve as a rallying point for voters, said Dawa Khan Menapal, an independent Kandahar candidate.
""People are determined to take part in the election because they want to show the Taliban that terror cannot stop the Afghans from deciding their future,"" he said.
With the Taliban operating freely across much of the country and heavy pressure from international partners for the vote to be held, the election was seen as a major test of the credibility of the government.
Voting in the 32 provinces saw a high turnout but the process was marred by logistical and technical glitches, with hundreds of polling stations failing to open when staff did not turn up.
Elections were also not held in central Ghazni province, southwest of the capital, which is still reeling from Taliban’s takeover in August. It was not immediately clear when they will be held.

Preliminary nationwide results are expected to be released in November. Final results will not be known until the new year.

Under President Xi Jinping, China has been engaged in a sweeping crackdown on official corruption. 
Earlier this month, Interpol, the France-based global police coordination body, said that Meng had resigned as its president, after French authorities said the Chinese official had been reported missing by his wife after traveling to his home country.
It is unclear where Meng is being held and it has not been possible to reach him for comment. It is also unclear if he has been allowed to retain legal representation.
In the latest move by the Chinese government against Meng, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which advises parliament though has no legislative powers, has decided to dismiss him from the body, state media said late on Friday.
The decision still needs formal approval from the body's standing committee, the official Xinhua news agency said, though this will only be a formality.
Meng had been a member of the body's foreign affairs committee.
Members of the advisory body do not enjoy immunity from prosecution, unlike members of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament.
Meng, 64 and a deputy minister of public security, became president of the global police cooperation agency in late 2016 amid a broader effort by China to secure leadership posts in international organizations. 

His appointment prompted concern at the time from rights groups that Beijing might try to leverage his position to pursue dissidents abroad.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed prime minister on Friday after President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed the incumbent in a surprise move that threatens political turmoil in the South Asian country.
As president, the pro-China Rajapaksa ushered in billions of dollars of investment from Beijing to help rebuild the country following the end of a 26-year-long civil war against Tamil separatists in 2009.
But that investment has since put the island nation deep in debt and forced it to hand over control of a strategic southern port to China - seen as part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative - drawing criticism from India and the United States.
Following months of infighting, Sirisena administered the oath of office to Rajapaksa after sacking premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was away touring the south of the country.
But Wickremesinghe later told reporters he remained the country's prime minister.
""I have the majority and I remain as the prime minister and I will function as the prime minister,"" he said.
Rajapaksa later said ""the people"" had requested his party take over the government and called on Wickremesinghe's supporters to respect democracy and the rule of law.
Mark Field, British Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific on Twitter called for all parties to ensure that the constitution is respected, while the U.S. Embassy in Colombo called on all to refrain from violence and follow due process. 
Sirisena later issued an official gazette notification that declared the removal of Wickremesinghe and appointment of Rajapaksa.
Under Sri Lanka's constitution, modeled on the French system of government, the president has executive powers while the prime minister heads the parliament. 
There was no immediate reaction from India which has long seen Sri Lanka, located just off its southern tip, as part of its area of influence and had been concerned about Rajapaksa's wooing of China. In recent weeks, both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe visited India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Underlining the risk of chaos, where the government had been under pressure over a misfiring economy, Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said on Twitter that the appointment of Rajapaksa as prime minister was a violation of the constitution, which was amended in 2015 to curtail the powers of the president.
""This is an anti-democratic coup,"" Samaraweera tweeted. 
State-run Rupavahini briefly went off-air when three ministers, including Samaraweera and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne, tried to address the nation during a live television program.
Earlier Sirisensa's United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) had said it would quit the ruling coalition, capping months of rising tensions between the president's bloc and Wickremesinghe's centre-right United National Party (UNP).
UPFA lawmaker Susil Premajayantha told reporters that a new cabinet would be sworn in soon.
Sri Lanka's $87 billion economy has been under pressure in recent years, with growth last year slowing to a 16-year low of 3.3 percent due to tight monetary and fiscal conditions, droughts and floods.
PLOT THICKENS
The ruling coalition had been further strained in recent days by strong criticism from Sirisena and his allies that ministers from Wickremesinghe's party did not act properly in investigating an alleged assassination plot against the president and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the new prime minister's younger brother.
The alleged plot briefly threatened to cause tension between Sri Lanka and India, after a report that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence services of involvement - a claim that New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.
Sirisena, along with some UPFA lawmakers including from his centre-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party, formed a coalition government with Wickremesinghe's UNP soon after Sirisena unexpectedly defeated former ally Rajapaksa in a presidential election in January 2015.
The UNP and UPFA, an alliance of several political parties, consolidated their coalition after a parliamentary election in August 2015.
But both coalition partners suffered heavy defeats in local elections in February this year to a party backed by Rajapaksa. Sirisena loyalists backed a no-confidence motion in April against the prime minister, who survived after a majority of legislators voted to support his coalition government.

In early September, Rajapaksa had led thousands of opposition demonstrators who blocked a main road in Colombo in protest at economic hardship and the delaying of provincial polls.

PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico on Friday offered temporary identification papers and jobs to migrants who register for asylum in the country, stepping up efforts to halt the advance of a U.S.-bound Central American caravan that has angered Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to Central America to try to stop the caravan of several thousand people. U.S. officials have said that up to 1,000 troops may be sent to the U.S. southern border to prevent the migrants from crossing.
Making reference to the caravan, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said that migrants wishing to obtain temporary identification documents, jobs or education for their children could do so by registering for asylum in southern Mexico.
""This plan is only for those who comply with Mexican laws, and it's a first step towards a permanent solution for those who are granted refugee status in Mexico,"" Pena Nieto said in a pre-recorded address broadcast on Friday afternoon.
To qualify for the scheme he called ""Estas en Tu Casa"" ('Make Yourself at Home') migrants had to be in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Pena Nieto said. 
Temporary work in the states would be extended so as also to benefit Mexicans, said Pena Nieto, who leaves office on Nov. 30.
The caravan, which is moving through Chiapas on the border of Guatemala, has enabled Trump to campaign hard on illegal immigration ahead of midterm congressional elections on Nov. 6, in which Republicans are battling to keep control of Congress.
Mexican officials have said those migrants who do not qualify for refugee status are liable to be deported.
Mexico's government has said that more than 1,700 people in the convoy have registered for asylum, while others have returned home. Estimates on the size of the group vary.
Alden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador to Mexico, told Mexican radio on Friday that the caravan could reach Mexico City by next Friday. He put an ""official"" headcount at 3,500, estimating that at least two-thirds of them were Hondurans.
The caravan set off in Honduras nearly two weeks ago, and has picked up other Central Americans en route.
Alexander Fernandez, a Honduran traveling in the caravan, said people began leaving the town of Pijijiapan at about 3 a.m. to head for Arriaga, a town in the west of Chiapas.
A banner hanging over a bridge on the migrants' path read: ""Your hearts are brave, don't give up.""
Tens of thousands of Central Americans set off for the United States every year, looking to escape violence and poverty. Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans make up the bulk of illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. border.
On Thursday night, thousands of people took refuge under small tents or teepees made from garbage bags in Pijijiapan's town square. Many people rushed to a nearby river in the afternoon to wash off the sweat of travel and extreme heat.

A White House official said on Thursday that ""a wide range of administrative, legal and legislative options"" were being considered regarding the migrants.

President Donald Trump said on Oct. 20 that Washington planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan had signed in 1987. It eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both states in Europe.
Washington has cited Russia's alleged violation of the treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies. Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact.
Russia had proposed a draft resolution in the 193-member General Assembly's disarmament committee, but missed the Oct. 18 submission deadline. On Friday, it called for a vote on whether the committee should be allowed to consider the draft, but lost with only 31 votes in favor, 55 against and 54 abstentions.
""In a year, if the U.S. withdraws from the treaty and begins an uncontrolled build-up of weapons, nuclear-capable weapons, we will be confronting a completely different reality,"" Andrei Belousov, deputy director of Russia's Department for Nonproliferation and Arms Control, told the committee. 
He questioned whether the United States was preparing for a war, asking: ""Why is it then ... do they want to leave the treaty? Why do they want to build up their nuclear capability?""
Belousov said if the United States follows through on its threat to withdraw, then Russia could raise the issue in the 15-member Security Council. However, such a move would not lead to any action as both countries have veto powers in the council.
U.S. Disarmament Ambassador Robert Wood told the committee Washington had spent some five years trying to engage Moscow on the issue of compliance and that Russia had ""denied having produced or tested a ground-launch cruise missile.""
""It's only recently that they admitted to having produced a ground-launch cruise missile but then maintained that it did not violate the range limits of the treaty,"" he said. 
""The U.S. has been extremely patient with Russia and our hope is that Russia will do the right thing and destroy that ground-launch cruise missile,"" Wood said. 

European members of NATO urged the United States on Thursday to try to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty rather than quit it, diplomats said, seeking to avoid a split in the alliance that Moscow could exploit.

Orban, who believes that European culture is under threat from migration and multiculturalism, has for years vilified the liberal Soros, who was born in Hungary and backs a number of causes there.
The U.S.-registered Central European University (CEU) founded by Soros in 1993 said on Thursday that it would switch to enrolling new students in Vienna if it did not get guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.
Last year, in a move seen by many as aimed specifically against the CEU and Soros, Orban's government changed Hungary's education law so as to withdraw the right to operate from foreign-registered universities which did not also offer courses in their home country.
One participant of the rally organized by opposition party Momentum, which has no seats in parliament, said the CEU represented freedom of thought and European values. 
""(For the government) it is really a problem, because thoughts are expressed here which criticize the government,"" said Peter Simor, a 36-year-old sleep scientist at another Budapest university.
The ruling nationalist Fidesz party said in a statement that Momentum was linked to the ""Soros network"" and described the outcry over the CEU as ""hysteria"" and its Dec 1 ultimatum as political bluff.
The dispute has worsened a rift between Orban's government and European Commission. 

In an interview published in Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovak media, French President Emmanuel Macron told eastern EU members on Friday not to fall out of step with the bloc's principles, singling out Hungary and Poland whose nationalist governments have clashed with Brussels over rule-of-law issues.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 03:04PM ET</span>",Calls for Saudi arms embargo pit EU values against interests,"By Robin Emmott, John Irish and Andrea Shalal
BRUSSELS/PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Pressure is growing for the European Union to consider an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia after Germany, Austria and the European Parliament called for an end to weapons sales over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In the space of a few hours that highlighted tensions over the matter, Germany's Angela Merkel on Friday reaffirmed that her country would not deliver any arms to Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi's death was explained, while French President Emmanuel Macron said such moves smacked of populist ""demagoguery"".
EU ambassadors may formally discuss the issue after a rare request to do so by governments, two diplomats said on Friday, and the Netherlands is lobbying for a new EU regime to sanction human rights abuses, regardless of where they happen.
But the debate in Brussels and in EU capitals is also reviving familiar splits in the bloc's foreign policy, with Europe's main powers following their own economic and political interests that tend to undermine any forceful EU foreign policy that aims to be guided by democracy and human rights.
The murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 has sparked global outrage, become a crisis for the world's top oil exporting state and underscored how Western powers are allied to an Arab kingdom that enforces floggings and the death penalty for dissent. 
The Belgian region of Wallonia, which owns firearms manufacturer FN Herstal, has said it will examine future requests for arms export licences to its top weapons client with ""the greatest circumspection"" following Khashoggi's murder.
While Austria, which holds the EU's six-month presidency, wants a halt to arms sales and Germany will stop approving weapons exports until Khashoggi's murder is cleared up, France had ignored such calls.
Macron went further on Friday, saying there was no link between arms sales and the killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
""That's pure demagoguery to say 'we must stop arms sales'. It's got nothing to do with Mr Khashoggi,"" he told reporters during a trip in Slovakia, while not ruling out other coordinated sanctions against those held responsible.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that Britain's weapons exports to Saudi Arabia met national and EU arms export licensing rules. 
Spain, meanwhile, is trying to go ahead with the sale of 400 bombs in order to protect a Saudi contract with a shipyard in the Andalusia region that would create 5,000 jobs. 
""If Austria is proposing this ban, then ask how many weapons Austria sells to Saudi Arabia,"" said a senior EU diplomat.
BILLIONS AT STAKE
Though Austria has a substantial arms industry, it sold a meager 1.4 million euros ($1.59 million) of arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia in 2017, according to EU data.
Germany approved around 400 million euros worth of arms supplies to Saudi Arabia in the first nine months of 2018. 
Last year, Germany sold 351 million euros worth of aircraft, including helicopters and planes, to Saudi Arabia, though EU data does not specify how much of that is military.
German weapons account for under 2 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms purchases.
Britain exported military goods to Saudi Arabia worth 1.1 billion pounds ($1.41 billion) in 2017, according to UK parliamentary papers, while tiny Belgium and Luxembourg combined for 184 million euros in arms sales to the Saudis last year. 
France sold Saudi Arabia 1.8 billion euros in planes, helicopters and other aerospace equipment in 2017, an amount that has climbed over the past decade, EU data shows, though again it does not say what part of that is military.
""The sale of weapons is something very political and part of a long-term vision,"" said Camille Lons, a researcher at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. 
Lons cited Libya, Syria and even the Sahel region, where France, which has thousands of troops on the ground, has sought Saudi help to finance local African forces. 
At the heart of Macron's strategy is Mohammed bin Salman, often referred to as MbS, the 33-year-old Saudi de facto leader who has painted himself as a reformer but is under scrutiny over his potential involvement in Khashoggi's seizure and death. 
""It's easy for (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel to come out with this when she sells weapons everywhere except Saudi Arabia,"" a senior French diplomat told Reuters. ""When you see global weapons sales, Germany is one of the largest in the world over the last couple of years, but Saudi isn't much.""
A German government spokeswoman on Friday welcomed Austria's initiative, but declined to comment when asked if German and Austria were isolated on their position within the EU.
Merkel vowed again on Friday to halt all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi's killing was explained.
One face-saving move for the European Union could be to sanction Saudi individuals accused of the Khashoggi murder and separate the issue from its close ties with the Saudi state.
EU governments recently agreed a mechanism to punish chemical weapons attacks by targeting people regardless of their nationality. 
They could set up a similar system for human rights abuses.
The United States has its Magnitsky human rights act that covers abusers in any country, named after Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower who died in prison.

""France and Germany have to deal with the big issue of arms exports. Something EU governments could do is to establish a Magnitsky-type act to react,"" said Rebecca Harms, a Green member of the European Parliament. She helped spearhead the assembly's resolution calling for an arms embargo and sanctions this week.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Syria pushes back on U.N. role in constitutional talks: U.N. envoy,"By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Syria wants the United Nations to simply facilitate efforts to rewrite the country's constitution and not choose a third of the committee that will undertake the job, outgoing U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura told the Security Council on Friday.
De Mistura briefed the 15-member body after meeting Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem in Damascus this week. De Mistura wants to convene a constitutional committee in November before he steps down at the end of the month, but he has accused the Syrian government of delaying the process.
""We do have a serious challenge, let's be frank. It is my intention to spare no efforts to address this challenge during the forthcoming weeks,"" de Mistura told the council. 
Participants at a Syrian peace conference in Russia in January agreed to form the 150-member committee to rewrite the Syrian constitution with a third chosen by the government, a third by opposition groups and a third by the United Nations.
""Minister Moualem did not accept a role for the U.N. in general in identifying or selecting the ... third list,"" de Mistura said. ""He underlined that the Syrian constitution is a highly sensitive matter of national sovereignty.""
He said Moualem indicated that Syria and Russia had recently agreed that the third list of participants should be decided by Syria, Russia, Turkey and Iran - the three countries pushing separate Syria political talks known as the Astana process - and then given to the United Nations for facilitation.
British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce questioned Russia's motives in trying to negotiate a political solution given Syria's efforts to stall a constitutional committee meeting.
""Either Russia has given the U.N. and this council assurances it has proved too weak to deliver on, or it was all a cynical smokescreen designed to divert attention and energy while Russia, Syria and Iran prosecuted the military campaign,"" she told the council.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said there were ""no grounds for establishing artificial deadlines for the establishment of the constitutional committee.""
De Mistura said he would attend a summit with the leaders of Russia, Turkey, France and Germany in Istanbul on Saturday. 
De Mistura's successor faces a tough battle to negotiate a political deal, which the West has said is needed to unlock its reconstruction support and to encourage the bulk of the millions of refugees in Europe and the Middle East to return.

Diplomats say Norway's Ambassador to China Geir Pedersen has emerged as a front-runner to become the fourth U.N. Syria envoy during the more than seven-year-old war.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean woman who won global renown for her public battle to find her husband, sons and pregnant daughter-in-law after they disappeared during the Pinochet dictatorship has died at the age of 93 without ever knowing their fate.
Ana Gonzalez, a housewife and daughter of a railroad worker from northern Chile, lost her husband Manuel Recabarren, two of her sons, Luis Emilio and Manuel Guillermo, and her daughter-in-law Nalvia Mena. They all disappeared in Santiago in April 1976 within 24 hours of each other.
She helped found the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared (AFDD) and led hunger strikes, protests and sit-ins that were often violently broken up by the regime's security forces.
She traveled to Europe and the United States to address the United Nations, the Organisation of American States, Amnesty International and the Vatican about human rights abuses in Chile.
The UN's recently appointed human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, a former Chilean president who was herself tortured by the regime, paid tribute to Gonzales' ""immense bravery and tireless defence of human rights and justice"" in a message posted on social media.
Gonzalez died in a Santiago hospital after years of ill health.
More than 3,000 people were killed or “disappeared” during Pinochet’s 1973-1990 rule and around 28,000 people were tortured.
Pinochet died in 2006 without facing a full trial on charges of human rights crimes. The Chilean authorities continue to run searches for the remains of the disappeared.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors have prepared an extradition request for 18 suspects from Saudi Arabia in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, authorities said on Friday, after President Tayyip Erdogan urged Riyadh to disclose who ordered the murder.
Erdogan has in recent days stepped up pressure on Saudi Arabia to come clean in the case, and Western governments have also voiced increasing scepticism, pitching the world's top oil exporter and a pivotal Middle East ally into a worsening crisis.
Erdogan said Turkey had more information than it had shared so far about the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi national and Washington Post columnist who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct.2. 
Khashoggi, who lived in the United States, was a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler.
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor on Thursday said the killing of Khashoggi was premeditated, contradicting a previous official statement that it happened accidentally during a tussle in the consulate. Riyadh's numerous shifting accounts of the killing have undermined Prince Mohammed's stance in the West.
Turkish prosecutors seeking the extradition accuse the 18 of ""murder by premeditation, monstrous intent or by torture"". Riyadh previously arrested the 18 as part of its investigation into the case. Those include a 15-man security team that Turkey says flew in hours before the killing and carried it out.
""Who gave this order?"" Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in Ankara. ""Who gave the order for 15 people to come to Turkey?"" he said.
Saudi officials initially denied having anything to do with Khashoggi's disappearance after he entered the consulate, which he had visited to obtain paperwork for a planned marriage.
""The reasoning behind the extradition request is that Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in Turkey by Saudi nationals who traveled to Turkey for this specific purpose,"" a senior Turkish official said. 
""It is clear that the judicial system in Turkey is better equipped to genuinely serve the cause of justice in this case."" 
Saudi Arabia has also sacked five senior government officials as part of the investigation. 
FIANCEE SPURNED TRUMP INVITE 
Khashoggi's Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said she did not accept an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump, the kingdom's staunchest Western champion, to visit the White House after Khashoggi's murder because she thought it was aimed at influencing public opinion in his own favor.
In her first television interview since the killing, Cengiz recounted the events leading up to their visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 where Khashoggi handed her his two mobile phones and went inside while she waited outside for him to emerge.
""Trump invited me to the United States but I perceived it as a statement to win public favor,"" Cengiz told broadcaster Haberturk, pausing at times during an interview and more than once breaking down in tears.
Trump and Prince Mohammed have cultivated warm ties though the U.S. president said earlier this week that the crown prince, as the kingdom's de facto ruler, bore ultimate responsibility for the operation against Khashoggi. Trump also said Riyadh had staged the ""worst cover-up ever"" over the killing.
Cengiz said Khashoggi was concerned tensions would arise when he visited the consulate for the first time on Sept. 28, but he was treated well at that visit, which appeared to reassure him, she said.
""He thought Turkey is a safe country and if he would be held or interrogated, this issue would be swiftly solved,"" she said.
SELF-STYLED REFORMER
How Western allies deal with Riyadh will hinge on the extent to which they believe responsibility for Khashoggi's death lies directly with Prince Mohammed and the Saudi authorities.
Prince Mohammed, who casts himself as a reformer, has said the killers will be brought to justice.
Erdogan said he had spoken with Prince Mohammed. ""I also told the crown prince. I said, 'You know how to make people talk. Whatever happened between these 18 people, this dodgy business is among them. If you are determined to lift suspicion, then the key point of our cooperation is these 18 people.'""
Turkish officials suspect Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, 59, inside the consulate and dismembered him. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording documenting the murder.
U.S. CIA Director Gina Haspel heard the audio during a visit to Turkey this week, sources told Reuters, and has briefed Trump about Turkey's findings and her discussions.
Saudi state television quoted the Saudi public prosecutor on Thursday as saying Riyadh was interrogating suspects on the basis of information given by a joint Saudi-Turkish task force.
Many Saudis have been shocked by Riyadh's admission after two weeks of denials and condemnation of foreign news reports.
On Friday, authorities tried to stem the domestic fallout, instructing mosque preachers to focus sermons on ""the fierce and unjust onslaught targeting the country"", according to a directive seen by Reuters that did not specifically mention the Khashoggi murder. 

One Riyadh cleric warned worshippers against repeating reports from TV or social media ""without contemplating the danger of this news"", adding that ""most of them are lies"".

The Israeli military responded with air strikes at three positions belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip, an army statement said. 
It said 16,000 Palestinians had gathered along the Gaza border and hurled grenades, firebombs and rocks at Israeli troops, who responded with ""riot dispersal means"" and live fire when required.
Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of the territory and the right to return to lands from which they fled or were driven when Israel was founded in 1948.
Since the protests began, 212 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Egyptian security officials have in the last two weeks been talking to Israeli leaders and officials of Hamas, which runs Gaza, and other factions in an attempt to restore calm along the border.
Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said protests would continue ""until we achieve our goals, and foremost is ending the blockade of the Gaza Strip"".

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a Palestinian protester died from a bullet wound, Palestinian medical officials said, after he was involved in a clash with Israeli troops in the village of Al-Mazraa Al-Gharbeya. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

The German foreign ministry earlier on Friday said it was providing consular services to the man, identified in German media as 29-year-old Patrick K., who was also sentenced to almost two years' prison for entering a sealed military territory. That sentence was suspended.
The reported court decision comes ahead of Merkel's arrival in Turkey on Saturday for an international summit on Syria hosted by Erdogan.
""Concerning Turkey, I will meet tomorrow in Istanbul with President Erdogan and of course we will talk about this case,"" Merkel told a news conference in Prague where she met Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis.
""We are pleased that we managed to get back several other people to Germany but each case is individual,"" she said.
Relations between the NATO partners soured after Germany condemned Turkey's arrests of some 50,000 people following a failed coup, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.
Ties have improved in recent months, especially after Turkey released German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel in February and lifted a travel ban imposed on journalist Mesale Tolu after she was released from prison in December following eight months in detention.
Germany has warned citizens visiting Turkey to be extra cautious about their social media feeds in response to a spate of cases of Germans arrested for online criticism of Erdogan's government.
Five German nationals are currently detained in Turkey for political reasons, foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday, but he declined to say whether Germany regarded this conviction as political. 
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, currently on an official trip to Turkey, asked about the sentence on Friday, said, ""We will look very closely at this sentence.""
A spokeswoman for the ministry earlier declined to comment on whether the minister would raise the issue during his visit.
The Turkish prosecutor accused K. of being a member of the Syrian Kurdish YPG, considered by Ankara to be a branch of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast, Huseyin Bilgi, lawyer for Patrick K., told Reuters on Friday.
The lawyer said K. wanted to go to Syria to help the wounded there, but was unable. He said they would appeal the verdict.

K.'s family said he was in Turkey on a hiking holiday, Die Welt reported.

ON BOARD THE GERMAN FRIGATE HAMBURG (Reuters) - Worried by a military build-up on its doorstep, Germany is leading efforts to coordinate NATO and European Union naval forces better in the Baltic Sea to counter Russia's beefed up presence in the area.
On Monday, Germany begins exercises off the Finnish coast involving 3,600 sailors and troops, 40 ships and 30 aircraft from more than a dozen countries. The maneuvers will focus on keeping crucial sea routes open in times of conflict. 
""The Baltic Sea is our front yard, so we and our neighbors obviously want to be able to move freely on the sea lines of communication,"" Captain Sven Beck told reporters aboard the German frigate Hamburg.
Berlin has come under heavy pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to play a bigger military role at a time when Western countries are anxious about tensions in the Baltic region. 
Russia has deployed missiles to its Kaliningrad enclave that can reach Berlin, NATO has thousands of troops in the region and Sweden - which like Finland remains outside the military alliance but is an EU member - is remilitarizing its Gotland island.
The Hamburg was moored in the Finnish port of Turku as one-by-one grey warships slipped into the harbor in preparation for the exercises, including a futuristic corvette from Sweden's Visby class. By evening snow flurries fell on a packed port as the Baltic winter began to set in.
The shallow waters and narrow straits of the Baltic make it easy to lay mines and hard to maneuver warships. Western military experts fear Russia could block the free movement of NATO ships, making it impossible to support the tiny Baltic states in case of a war.
Moscow says it is not threatening anyone and has the sovereign right to deploy weapons on its own territory including in Kaliningrad, which is separated from the rest of Russia and borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania.
During the exercises, naval vessels will practice clearing mines from harbor entrances, escort cargo ships through contested waters and simulate using force. 
""The aim of our exercise is to secure the sea lines of communication, those lines that you can't see but that guarantee trade and prosperity in the countries along the Baltic coast,"" Beck said, using the military term for major sea routes.
Germany has been trying to bring the navies of NATO and EU countries on the Baltic closer together since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, starting with regular meetings of fleet commanders the following year.
It is also building a new naval command center in Rostock designed to house a permanent staff of international officers. In times of crisis, this will be able to lead NATO or EU operations in the Baltic from 2023.
MORE RESPONSIBILITY
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said last month that as the biggest NATO and EU country on the Baltic, Germany must ""take more responsibility for the region"" - a sign it is slowly shedding its post-World War Two reluctance to take the military lead.
Other Western countries welcome the German initiative. ""We are very happy that Germany has taken the lead in that sense,"" Finnish navy chief Admiral Veijo Taipalus said.
Coordination was necessary, not least because Finland and Sweden could not access intelligence restricted to alliance members.

""We don't have a big navy, but in relation to the Baltic countries it is huge,"" said Capt. Beck. ""So we are happy to take the responsibility.""

455,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Clocks stopped? Europe hesitates before 'last' time change,"By Daphne Psaledakis and Peter Maushagen
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - If Jean-Claude Juncker has his way, this weekend could be the last time many Europeans put their clocks back for winter -- but many EU diplomats doubt governments can overcome inertia and shift the rules so soon, if ever.
Last month, the European Commission president announced with some fanfare a plan to scrap the twice-yearly switch of Europe's clocks from next year. Millions of people had called in a survey for the decades-old practice to end, saying getting up an hour earlier from March and then back again in October was a pain.
EU officials said Juncker, who will step down as EU chief executive a year from now, also wanted to make a point about the EU, much derided by a rising strain of nationalism. He wanted to step back from imposing rules on member states -- although the plan means going from demanding the time-change to banning it.
The Commission wants each EU government to decide by April which time zone they want to be in permanently -- whether in October 2019 they want to stay in summer time forever or turn their clocks back one last time to permanent winter time. 
Member states have a first full chance to discuss the issue on Monday when their transport ministers meet in Graz, Austria. The 9 a.m. start may feel gentle for those who benefited from an extra hour's sleep on Sunday morning as clocks go back. 
Diplomats and EU officials say it is most likely that, in the coming months, governments will hold up the process to have more time to work through the implications for transport, energy, road safety and so on -- not to mention which time zone they want to choose permanently.
Austria, which chairs ministerial meetings till December, has proposed delaying any change beyond next year. That may throw the whole process into question, as a new Commission takes over.
Some criticism of scrapping summer and winter time changes focuses on the Commission's assertions that most Europeans back the move. While there have been calls in some countries, notably in Scandinavia and Germany, for an end to the switches, the Commission's survey was queried by experts who warn online polls tend to be filled in by a small minority who care about the question.
Some 4.6 million EU citizens -- out of 510 million -- took part in the Commission's online survey over the summer. Of those, 84 percent of them were against putting clocks forward and back every year.
However, the Commission acknowledges that it was not a systemic sounding of opinion across the bloc -- fully seven in 10 respondents were in Germany, where the survey generated substantial media interest.

Such polls ""cannot provide any valid results"", said Walter Kraemer, a professor at Germany's Dortmund Technical University and the author of ""How to Lie with Statistics"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India's Kerala state have arrested more than 2,000 people in the past few days in a crackdown on demonstrators protesting against allowing women of menstrual age into a prominent Hindu temple, state officials said.
Conservative Hindu groups last week prevented women from entering the Sabarimala hill temple, clashing with police and damaging cars and buses, in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling that lifted a centuries-old ban on women or girls aged from 10 years to 50.
India's top court last month declared the ban illegal, saying it infringed the right to worship.
""We have registered around 450 cases and arrested around 2,000 people so far,"" the state's top police official Loknath Behera was quoted as saying by ANI News, a Reuters partner.
""We have identified several others and more arrests will be made. We will do what must lawfully be done,"" Behera added.
It is unclear how many people have been charged as many of the cases could involve more than one individual.
State authorities had appealed to the protesters not to turn the area around the temple into a battlefield last week. But many who believed in the ban took to the streets, thwarting efforts by a few women to visit the temple when it opened for a few days last week.
They say that the ban was essential to the rites related to the temple's chief deity Ayyappan, considered eternally celibate. In some Hindu communities, menstruating women are regarded as unclean, leading to restrictions and in a few cases outright bans from entering certain places.
In Pathanamthitta district, where the temple is located, there were 160 arrests, said the district police chief T. Narayanan. 
""We have registered 51 cases and made 160 arrests so far, mainly on charges of destruction of public property, outraging the modesty of women, and obstructing government servants from doing their duty,"" Narayanan told Reuters.
Some of those arrested are in jail because their offences were non-bailable, he added.
Many of the 2,000 arrested were people from other districts who had joined the protests and were later identified by police from video clips.
More than a dozen petitions have been filed urging the Supreme Court to review the ruling, which was passed by a full, constitutional bench. The lone woman judge on that five-member bench, Justice Indu Malhotra, had upheld the practice, saying, ""notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion.""
Activists in favor of the ban say they see hope in her dissenting voice.
The Supreme Court will hear the review petition on Nov. 13, days before the temple's next re-opening on Nov. 17.
The police are preparing new plans to safeguard women who want to go to the temple then.
""We're taking suggestions from a police committee on how to provide protection to women. We'll discuss it with the (state) government as well,"" police chief Behera said.

The temple, nestled in a forest on a hillside in the Western Ghats mountain range is miles from the nearest road and getting there means climbing up some steep slopes. It remains open for only 127 days in a year.

MANAMA (Reuters) - Defence Secretary Jim Mattis will stress the U.S. commitment to Middle East security at the weekend, officials said, amid Western concern that any loosening of U.S. ties to Riyadh after Jamal Khashoggi's murder could allow Russia to fill the vacuum.
Mattis will give a speech at the annual Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain on Saturday on the United States' policy in the Middle East which will be closely watched in capitals around the region. 
Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said that Mattis' speech would emphasize that the United States was committed to help allies ""re-instill stability in a chaotic region.""
""So continue to look to the United states as your security partner of choice because you can rely on us and depend on us to be there long term,"" Wheelbarger told reporters traveling with Mattis.
There is increasing concern that if Washington abandons the region, countries like Russia will fill the vacuum. 
Nowhere will the speech be watched more closely then in Riyadh, after Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate this month was premeditated.
The death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sparked global outrage and mushroomed into a crisis for the world's top oil exporter and strategic ally of the West.
Riyadh is expected to be watching how far, if at all, Mattis goes in censuring the kingdom in his speech.
After Saudi King Salman spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday about the killing, the Kremlin said Russia had no reason to doubt the statements of the king and crown prince that the royal family was not involved. 
Dozens of Western officials, bankers, and executives shunned a big investment conference in Riyadh this week. 
Russia sent the head of its Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF, who said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would become a new partner in a joint Russia-China Investment Fund. 
Saudi Arabia is the lynchpin of a U.S.-backed regional bloc against Iran but the crisis has strained Riyadh's relations with the West.
Experts believe that Washington will have to take some measures to make clear to Saudi Arabia that Khashoggi's killing is unacceptable.
""I think the key here is that if the administration wants to shift the focus back onto Iran the only way to do that is by taking some steps to respond to what the Saudis have done,"" Dennis Ross, who served as top Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama, said.
Ross said the increased global pressure on Riyadh may also present an opportunity for Washington to push the kingdom to end a 16-month-old dispute between Qatar and four Arab states that analysts say has weakened regional coordination against Iran.
Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing their arch-rival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott impinges on its sovereignty.
The United States has tried, without success, to mediate in the dispute. It is an ally of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, and Qatar is home to a major U.S. air base.
""This might not be a bad time for the administration to try to go back in and mediate that dispute, this might be a point where the Saudis will want to be more responsive to us,"" Ross said.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",What are confidentiality agreements at the heart of Britain's 'Me Too' debate?,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - A furor in Britain over allegations of sexual harassment against retail billionaire Philip Green this week has reignited the debate about the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).
WHAT HAS TRIGGERED THE DEBATE?
Green, the entrepreneur whose Arcadia group owns the TopShop fashion chain, was named in Britain's parliament on Thursday by Labour politician Peter Hain as the businessman at the center of allegations of sexual harassment and racist abuse of staff.
Hain identified Green after the Daily Telegraph reported earlier in the week that a leading businessman had been granted an injunction by a judge which blocked the newspaper from naming the individual who was the subject of the allegations. 
The newspaper was also barred from reporting details of the accusations. 
The Telegraph alleged that the businessman had used NDAs to ""silence and pay off his alleged victims.""
Hain was able to name Green in the House of Lords by using parliamentary privilege, which allows members to speak freely without facing legal action and enables the media to report their comments.
HOW HAS GREEN RESPONDED?
Green has denied breaking the law and said in a statement: ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behavior, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.""
The entrepreneur said that Arcadia ""thoroughly investigated"" accusations and grievances made by staff and that like other large businesses, the company ""sometimes receives formal complaints from employees"".
""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers,"" he said, adding that he could not comment on the settlements because they were confidential.
WHAT ARE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS?
NDAs are ubiquitous in commercial transactions such as mergers and acquisitions and are commonly used to protect company's confidential information and trade secrets. 
""In 99 percent of cases an NDA refers to the period in which you’re negotiating the sale of purchase of a business,"" said Richard Miskella, a partner at law firm Lewis Silkin. 
""But over time people have started to use the term more and more loosely so that it just refers to confidentiality clauses and the thing that's quite rightly causing a lot of concern now is the use of confidentiality and gagging clauses in settlement agreements in employment disputes.""
NDAs were thrust into the spotlight recently by the sexual assault scandal that has engulfed movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who used NDAs as part of settlement agreements with alleged victims.
If an individual breaches an NDA they could potentially face a lawsuit.
""There's legitimate unease about the perception that rich people can use these confidentiality terms to silence people,"" said Miskella.
WHAT ARE BRITISH REGULATORS DOING? 
Confidentiality agreements are now coming under more scrutiny in Britain. It comes amid the wider ""Me Too"" movement around the world against sexual harassment and assault.
In March, the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which regulates law firms, issued a warning notice about the improper use of NDAs. 
It said that such agreements should not be used to prevent people from reporting misconduct to regulators or offences to law enforcement agencies, or as a ""means of improperly threatening litigation against, or otherwise seeking improperly to influence, an individual in order to prevent or deter or influence a proper disclosure.""
That was followed in July by a report on sexual harassment in the workplace by the British parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, which urged the government to ""clean up"" the use of NDAs by enforcing better control and regulation amid concern the agreements are being used to silence victims.
The Telegraph story has brought NDAs into focus once again.
While Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that she would not comment on a particular case, she added that it was clear that some employers are using NDAs unethically.
""The government is going to bring forward measures for consideration for consultation to seek to improve the regulation around non-disclosure agreements and make it absolutely explicit to employees when a non-disclosure agreement does not apply or cannot be enforced,"" she said.

EU member states are in disagreement over how the bloc should deal with tens of thousands of migrants arriving every year in Europe, the bulk of them by sea from Turkey and North Africa.
In June, a summit of all EU leaders asked the Commission to study ways to set up ""regional disembarkation platforms"" in North African countries, including Tunisia, for migrants rescued by European vessels in the Mediterranean.
However, there has been little appetite in Africa and EU officials have long questioned the legality and practicality of such camps -- a view underlined in Juncker's blunt reply.

Two police sources said the package sent by mail at the ministry contained long wires, while the second source said the package additionally contained batteries attached to a small box. 
The semi-official Athens News Agency said it contained a pressure gauge and was addressed to Yiannis Dragasakis, the deputy prime minister of the Greek government. 
The ministry of foreign affairs is in central Athens, in a building complex opposite the Greek parliament.
Small-scale attacks on businesses, state buildings, police and politicians are frequent in Greece, which has a long history of political violence.
Last year a former Greek prime minister was injured when a booby-trapped package exploded in his car. 
Earlier this year, threatening letters, including one containing a bullet, were sent to Nikos Kotzias who was serving as foreign minister at the time. 
Kotzias, who resigned last week, was considered an architect of an accord brokering an end to a name dispute with neighboring Macedonia. Many Greeks are against the deal.

Rome and Italy's financial capital Milan were hardest hit, with buses, trams and underground services set to operate a full service only during the morning and evening rush hour. In Rome, many rubbish collection workers also walked off the job.
Unions called the strike to demand better working conditions, more hirings and increased public sector investment. One union said it was protesting about the 2019 budget, accusing the government of not doing enough for ordinary workers.
Many commuters appeared bemused by the stoppage, which followed a string of walkouts affecting public transport in Rome.
""Such frequent strikes in which the reasons are not well-explained only damage citizens,"" said Rome resident, Valerio. 
The strike comes a day before a sit-in at Rome City Hall against what organizers say is the degradation of the capital and its public services. 
On Nov. 11, residents will be called to vote in a referendum on whether to open up to private firms the city's transport network, which is currently run exclusively by the municipality.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - In Brazil's most polarizing election in decades, women have long held the decisive swing vote, with a quarter of the female electorate up for grabs just a month ago — twice the undecided rate among Brazilian men.
Days ahead of Sunday's deciding vote, however, right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro has pushed them off the fence, splitting Brazilian women along deep fault lines. 
On one side, he has won the backing of women fed up with crime, corruption scandals and economic recession under the leftist Workers Party, represented by his rival Fernando Haddad.
On the other, women say they cannot bring themselves to vote for a man with a track record of offending minorities and women, including telling a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape and defending the gender pay gap.
The latest survey from pollster Ibope shows a close divide, with 44 percent of women supporting Bolsonaro and 40 percent for Haddad. Men have broken overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro, who has the support of 56 percent, against just 36 percent for Haddad.
The largest demonstrations against Bolsonaro in recent months have been led by women, gathering tens of thousands of protesters under the slogan ""elenao"" or ""not him.""
Yet their campaign on social media and in the streets of major cities spurred a backlash from Bolsonaro supporters declaring ""ele sim"" or ""yes, him.""
Many women shrug off the feminist arguments against the seven-term congressman, arguing that crime and political graft have gotten so bad that his promises on those fronts come first.
""I am really worried about violence. I have nine children and I am a grandmother. It's hard to think what kind of life they'll have in this unsafe city,"" said Rose Nascimento, a 50-year-old businesswoman in Rio de Janeiro. 
""I hope Bolsonaro will do something about it,"" she said, adding that the lawmaker is ""a man that respects family values.""
Yet Mohara Valle, an activist on behalf of black women, said she was worried about minority rights under Bolsonaro. 
""We don't want to go backward,"" said Valle, 28. ""We have to keep fighting for more policies to let us not only live, but live well with full rights to our own bodies.""
Maira Fernandes, a 36-year-old attorney, pointed to comments by Bolsonaro's vice presidential candidate, retired General Hamilton Mourao, who described homes run by women as ""factories for misfits."" 
""Nothing would be worse for women than a victory for Bolsonaro and Mourao,"" said Fernandes. She added that Haddad's choice of running mate, feminist Manuela D'Avila, gave her confidence that they would combat violence against women.
Still, for women such as Sandra Nicacio, a 54-year-old lawyer, Bolsonaro's tough talk on crime is more assuring, such as a proposal to chemically castrate convicted rapists.
Bolsonaro's praise for the country's 1964-1985 military government also inspires hope for Brazilians who long for a time when violence was less widespread.
""My memories during the military dictatorship are that I had a good education and nothing was missing,"" Nicacio said. ""What I am now professionally, I owe to the dictatorship.""

467,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","China will prosecute graft, terror suspects even if they flee","BEIJING (Reuters) - China changed its law on Friday to allow judgments to be delivered in corruption and terror cases even when the suspects do not appear in court, as Beijing ramps up pressure on dozens of suspected criminals hiding overseas.
Since taking office more than five years ago, President Xi Jinping has waged war on graft at all levels of the ruling Communist Party and has pledged that the fight must continue until corruption is impossible and unimaginable for officials.
The campaign has spread beyond China's borders to graft suspects who have fled abroad, though efforts have been hampered by suspicion among Western nations uneasy about handing over suspects to a system they believe might not provide a fair trial.
Now an amendment to the criminal procedure law by China's largely rubber-stamp parliament will strengthen the overseas graft and terror fight by allowing judgments to be delivered in cases involving absentee suspects, a senior lawmaker said.
Wang Aili, director of the Criminal Law Office with parliament's Legal Affairs Commission, told a news briefing that those who could be tried in absentia would include corruption suspects and those wanted for harming national security or for involvement in terror cases.
To qualify for a trial in absentia, there should be a time-sensitive urgency in handling the case and the top prosecutor would need to approve it, Wang said.
A copy of the subpoena would also need to be sent to the defendant to guarantee their ""right to know"", he said.
A suspect can be defended in court in such ""default judgment"" cases, even if they are not there, by a lawyer, who can be chosen by the defendant's close relatives or have one assigned by the state, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Once the judgment is issued, the defendant and their close relatives can appeal to a higher court, Xinhua said.
In April 2015, authorities published a list of 100 ""most-wanted"" graft suspects believed to be hiding overseas, many in the United States, Canada and Australia. More than half have come back to China, some voluntarily.
China has turned up the pressure on graft suspects overseas by asking their family members to contact them and encourage their return, as well as by releasing personal details about the individuals, including their addresses.
The change comes after China passed a new supervision law in March and set up a powerful anti-graft commission to extend the graft fight to all state employees, whether party officials or not.
The new system and law weaken rights protections for suspects by entrenching the use of controversial detention and questioning techniques that can allow abuse or torture, rights groups and legal experts have said.
China is also in the midst of tightening its security laws having passed a tough counter-terrorism law in late 2015, mostly to combat what it says is a serious threat from Islamist militants in its far western region of Xinjiang.

China has not provided details of how many terror suspects may be overseas, including how many ethnic Uighurs from Xinjiang the government thinks have gone to the Middle East and Afghanistan to join militant groups there.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, denounced on Friday a U.S. decision to leave an arms control treaty that helped end the Cold War, saying it heralded a new arms race which increased the risk of nuclear conflict.
President Donald Trump has said Washington plans to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed in 1987. The pact eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe.
Gorbachev, in a column for the New York Times newspaper, said the U.S. move was ""a dire threat to peace"" that he still hoped might be reversed through negotiations. 
""I am being asked whether I feel bitter watching the demise of what I worked so hard to achieve. But this is not a personal matter. Much more is at stake,"" he wrote. ""A new arms race has been announced.""
Washington has cited Russia's alleged violation of the treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies. Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact. 
Stationing of U.S. land-based nuclear missiles in western Europe provoked mass protests in the 1980s. Some U.S. allies now fear Washington might deploy a new generation of them in Europe, with Russia doing the same in its exclave of Kaliningrad, once again turning the continent into a potential nuclear battlefield.
If the United States made good on its pledge to leave the treaty, Gorbachev said he hoped that U.S. allies would refuse to be what he called launchpads for American missiles which Trump has spoken of developing. 
President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would be forced to target any European countries that agreed to host U.S. missiles.
Gorbachev, 87, said that any disputes about compliance could be solved if there were sufficient political will. 
It was clear, however, that Trump's aim was to release the United States from global constraints, he said, accusing Washington of destroying the ""system of international treaties and accords"" that underpinned peace and security after World War Two.
""Yet I am convinced that those who hope to benefit from a global free-for-all are deeply mistaken. There will be no winner in a 'war of all against all' — particularly if it ends in a nuclear war. And that is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. An unrelenting arms race, international tensions, hostility and universal mistrust will only increase the risk.""

Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci agreed to open one new checkpoint in the west of the island and another in the east, they said in a joint statement issued through the United Nations mission in Cyprus.
The announcement followed a meeting between Anastasiades and Akinci at the U.N. mission early on Friday.
The new crossing points are due to be opened on Nov. 12, allowing further interraction between populations estranged for decades until the first checkpoints opened in 2003.
There are presently seven checkpoints dotted along the 180-km (112-mile) ceasefire line splitting Cyprus east to west, which is patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers.
The island was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.
U.N.-led peace talks between the two sides collapsed in acrimony in Switzerland in July 2017, mainly due to disagreement over the future role Turkey could play in a post-settlement Cyprus.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Special Report: How Republicans are using immigration to scare voters to the polls,"By Joseph Tanfani, Jason Lange and Letitia Stein
INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana (Reuters) - The commercial opens with an appeal to fear: a hoodie-wearing man prowling an alley, knife in hand. His face remains hidden but the ad makes it clear: He’s an illegal immigrant.
“We need tough immigration enforcement to keep dangerous criminals out,” says the ad by a national conservative political group, part of an effort to help a Republican challenger, Mike Braun, oust a Democratic incumbent in Indiana and capture a U.S. Senate seat in November’s congressional elections.
As they try to hang on to control of Congress, Republican candidates are following the lead of President Donald Trump and turning to rhetoric about immigrants as a tactic to motivate voters. The scope of that strategy emerges in a nationwide Reuters examination of ad buys, candidates’ social media posts and polling, as well as dozens of interviews with candidates, voters and campaign strategists.
The trend is especially visible on Twitter. Congressional Republicans seeking re-election have dramatically increased the number of tweets they post about immigration since Trump’s election, a Reuters/Ipsos analysis of social media shows. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2EIPef5)Immigration messaging has surged across the spectrum of Republican-held districts – highly competitive swing seats and reliably Republican ones, in places with immigrant populations both large and small.
The shift also shows up in the campaign ad wars. In races from Florida to California, in border states and ones with few immigrants, Republicans have poured millions of dollars into advertising that depict illegal immigrants as criminals and vowed enthusiastic support for Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexican border, the Reuters review shows.
This year, 20 percent of pro-Republican ads in congressional races have cited immigration, according to an analysis of broadcast advertising data through Oct. 15. That’s up from 8 percent in the same period of the 2014 congressional elections and 5 percent in the 2010 races. The analysis was conducted for Reuters by Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political ads.
Spending on Republican ads that mention immigration has more than doubled to $62.4 million this year from the 2014 elections and has quadrupled since the 2010 races, the Kantar Media/CMAG data shows. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2EEKveE) Immigration ad spending has also surged in state-level races. (Kantar Media/CMAG estimated earlier this month that total political ad spending for broadcast television would rise to $2.7 billion this year from $2.1 billion in 2014.)
In February, as Braun vied for the party’s nomination for the Indiana Senate seat, he ran a commercial highlighting a deadly highway crash involving a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. “There are lives at stake,” Braun said in the ad. In an interview with Reuters, he said he was not trying to demonize immigrants but was “making a point that border security is important.”
In Indiana, only about 5 percent of the state’s residents are immigrants, compared with 13.6 percent in the United States as a whole. But in the last two months, nearly a third of television ads sponsored or partially sponsored by Braun have mentioned immigration, said Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, a nonpartisan group tracking televised political advertising. Trump won Indiana by nearly 20 points in the 2016 election.
The attack ad featuring the knife-wielding immigrant was produced by One Nation, a political nonprofit. Spokesman Chris Pack said in a statement that the group works independently of campaigns and “strongly supports the efforts of the President and congressional leadership to reform our broken immigration system.”
A number of Republican ads link illegal immigrants to crime, but statistics paint a more nuanced picture. While people in the United States illegally have in some instances committed high-profile crimes, multiple studies – including ones from conservative groups like the Cato Institute - have found that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.
National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Matt Gorman declined to comment on the overall Republican messaging on immigration, but he did say he sees benefits in opposing so-called sanctuary cities, largely Democratic-run metropolises which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants. Dozens of localities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing ""sanctuary"" movement.
""The issue of sanctuary cities is an issue we have used in several ads this cycle. It’s a potent issue,"" he said. ""It’s a commonsense thing that many folks are against.""
Trump won the White House on a promise to crack down on illegal immigrants. He has tried to end a program that gave protection for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He has ordered more aggressive enforcement and longer detention. One policy, to separate children from their parents at the southern border, set off an uproar and the president ended the policy in June.
Trump’s administration has also limited legal immigration, imposing more restrictions on work visas and sharply cutting the number of refugees allowed into the United States.
A thousands-strong group of immigrants now heading north toward the United States from Central America has inflamed the debate over illegal immigration just days before Americans head to the polls. The caravan has riled up Trump, who is intensifying his efforts to frame the Nov. 6 elections around the threat he says illegal immigrants pose to Americans’ safety.
Trump’s nationalist tone echoes sentiments rising in parts of Europe since the arrival in 2015 of more than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond. Hungary built a border fence along its southern border with Serbia, and anti-immigration politics have roiled Germany’s parliament.
A DRAMATIC EVOLUTION
The anti-immigration rhetoric, advertisements and campaign events, combined with the party’s embrace of Trump’s immigration crackdown, represent a dramatic evolution of Republicanism under Trump. Anti-immigration themes now dominate a party that for decades was defined by fiscal, social and national security conservatism.
As recently as 2013, when the Senate passed an immigration bill with bipartisan support, a significant portion of the Republican Party backed immigration reform – including a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million people living in the United States illegally. But those voices have been mostly silenced since the rise of Trump, drowned out by his statements decrying “amnesty for illegals” and “chain migration,” his term for the longstanding U.S. policy that allows legal immigrants to bring family members into the country.
Immigration is now seen as the top issue for likely Republican voters, especially among those who are older and without a college degree, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. Twenty-three percent of Republicans said this month immigration was the “most important problem” facing the country, up from 4 percent in January 2012. By contrast, Democrats are far more focused on healthcare, the polls show.
“Immigration is literally number one - with a bullet - in every survey we do,” said Brandon Moody, a Republican consultant at Axiom Strategies working in the Montana Senate race. Moody says the issue also serves as a kind of shorthand, signaling loyalty to Trump’s agenda.
“GREATEST THREATS”
The Reuters/Ipsos analysis of Twitter data shows that the number of Republican lawmakers tweeting about immigration has risen sharply since Trump’s election. Reuters and Ipsos searched for immigration-related terms in tweets by Republican federal lawmakers who are seeking re-election in November and have actively tweeted since 2016.
Across 156 official Twitter accounts of Republican lawmakers and tens of thousands of tweets, the analysis identified 1,409 posts in the first nine months of 2018 which included immigration-related terms and phrases such as “immigrant,” “build the wall” or “border.” That’s a nearly 80 percent increase from 795 posts in the same months of 2017 and more than triple the number from the same period in 2016.
Reuters reviewed every tweet, weeding out those unrelated to immigration or which were entirely critical of Trump and his policies. The messages varied widely, from statements supporting Trump’s policies to nuanced calls to build a border wall while also reuniting families separated by border authorities.
The tweets ranged in tone. Some linked immigrants to threats of violence against Americans, like Texas Representative Randy Weber’s Jan. 30 tweet: “President says fix the border so gangs can’t get in & Americans won’t be murdered.”
Weber’s office declined to comment on the tweet.
Others praised Trump’s get-tough stance. “Illegal incursions way down, rule of law restored,” wrote Rod Blum, a Republican in Iowa facing a difficult re-election. He tweeted about immigration at least 14 times between January and September. Reuters did not find any tweets by Blum on the subject in 2016 and only a handful in 2017. Blum did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters/Ipsos polling indicates that Republican lawmakers are largely preaching to the converted: 77 percent of Republican likely voters in a Sept. 8-17 survey said they supported policies to deport more illegal immigrants. An equal number backed building a wall on the southern border.
Across the 156 Republican Twitter accounts, Reuters identified only 37 tweets between 2016 and 2018 unambiguously critical of Trump’s immigration policies - almost all criticizing the separation of families at the border. The critical tweets came from 20 lawmakers who had also posted other tweets supporting strengthening border security or cracking down on illegal immigration.
Some conservatives, while backing stringent curbs on immigration, say the harsh tone has potentially far-reaching consequences – adding to political polarization, spawning harsher enforcement and potentially limiting the party’s appeal to America’s growing minority population.
“Trump has remade the Republican Party into a blood and soil national political party that is hostile to immigration,” said Steve Schmidt, a former Republican political consultant. He left the party in June in part because of the policy of separating mothers and children at the southern border. Schmidt said the country’s growing Hispanic population ultimately will render the immigration issue “a death knell for the Republican Party.”
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement that Trump supports an immigration system based on the merit of the applicants, which “has nothing to do with race.”
CONFLICTED HISTORY
While Trump has thrust immigration to the center of the party’s identity, the roots of this transformation began years ago. In Indiana, the state’s Republicans have made a journey that mirrors that of the national party.
In 2006, Republican legislators pushed a plan in the state legislature that would deny public health services to immigrants who had entered the country illegally. Mike Murphy, a Republican representative from Indianapolis, rose to speak in the glass-domed statehouse. 
Murphy had long worked to bring more Latinos into the party. Since many of the bill’s backers were conservative Christians, Murphy quoted verses from the gospel of Matthew about charity to outcasts and strangers. “I just turned it against them – how do you guys profess to be Christians?” Murphy said. The bill was defeated overwhelmingly.
That year, Mike Pence, a U.S. congressman from Indiana at the time, was considered a rising conservative star. He waded in with a plan to allow illegal immigrants a path to achieve legal status – though he said they would have to leave the country first. Pence pitched his plan in moral terms, calling immigration reform “a test of the character of the conservative movement.”
Pence was pilloried by hardliners, who labeled the plan a “stealth amnesty.” The bill went nowhere.
As the far-right Tea Party movement rose in the Republican Party in 2010, resentment toward immigration increased throughout the state. When a new immigration-related bill came before Indiana lawmakers in 2011, they passed it, granting police the authority to detain people suspected of being illegal immigrants. A federal judge later threw out much of the law. 
“SCARY TO THINK ABOUT”
In 2015, Pence, then Indiana’s governor, signed an order that aimed to block Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana, a harbinger of Trump’s later ban on immigration from mostly Muslim countries. Pence, now Trump’s vice president, saw his order overturned by a federal appeals judge.
Pence's spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, said Pence has ""always been for a strong, secure, enforced border and upholding the rule of law,” and that Indiana’s move to reject Syrian refugees was “fundamentally different” from the issue of illegal immigration in the southern border. “Conflating the issue of illegal immigration from our southern border with whether or not a state accepts refugees from Syria is comparing apples and oranges,"" she said.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump returned frequently to Indiana. At nearly every rally, he hit hard at illegal immigration, reprising crimes committed by people in the country illegally. “Raped, sodomized and killed,” he said at a rally in South Bend on May 2, 2016. “This is all over the country. We’re not taking it any more.”
Trump’s runaway win in Indiana’s presidential nominating contest a day later sealed his conquest of a crowded Republican field. Since the rise of Trump, Murphy said, it has become nearly impossible to have a civil debate about immigration. “Donald Trump made it ok to hate,” said Murphy, who is still a Republican but no longer in the state legislature.
The White House declined to comment on Murphy’s comments.
In sparsely populated Montana, almost 90 percent of the population is white and illegal immigrants are estimated to number only in the few thousands. Voter Sandy Shumaker says she was ignorant about how illegal immigration was affecting the country before listening to Trump.
Wearing an American flag hat with the slogan “Keep America Great,” the 70-year-old retired nurse said immigration is now one of her top concerns. She did not single out any specific campaign ad as a source of her thinking. Yet she echoed concerns about illegal immigrants voting for Democrats, as Trump has claimed without proof, and that Americans are being taken advantage of.
She was the first person in line for a campaign rally last month headlined by Donald Trump Jr., waiting hours to hear him stump for Matt Rosendale, the Republican challenging Democratic Senator Jon Tester. 
“Open borders are scary,” Shumaker said. “Who knows what else is getting in? Drugs, I could imagine. I don’t know, Middle Eastern people that do not have our best interests at heart? It’s just scary to think about it.”

Erdogan also said Riyadh needed to reveal the identity of the ""local cooperator"" who Saudi officials earlier said had taken Khashoggi's body from Saudi agents after the journalist was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Saudi Arabia said on Thursday the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was premeditated, reversing previous statements that it was unintended. 
Khashoggi's murder has sparked global outrage and mushroomed into a crisis for the world's top oil exporting country and Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto ruler.
""Who gave this order?"" Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in Ankara. ""Who gave the order for 15 people to come to Turkey?"" he said, referring to a 15-man Saudi security team Turkey has said flew into Istanbul hours before the killing. Erdogan also said Saudi's public prosecutor was due to meet the Istanbul prosecutor in Istanbul on Sunday.
Saudi officials initially denied having anything to do with Khashoggi's disappearance after he entered the consulate, before changing the official account to say an internal investigation suggested he was accidentally killed in a botched operation to return him to the kingdom.
On Thursday, Saudi state TV quoted the Saudi public prosecutor as saying the killing had been planned, and that prosecutors were interrogating suspects on the basis of information provided by a joint Saudi-Turkish task force.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - About 1,000 Indonesian Muslims held a rally in the capital, Jakarta, on Friday to protest against the burning by members of the country's biggest Muslim organization of a flag bearing an Islamic tenet.
The protest comes after a video went viral in Indonesia this week showing members of the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) burning a rival group's flag with the Tauhid, an Islamic concept asserting that there is only one God.
The peaceful protest was a reminder of the ardor that can arise as the world's biggest Muslim-majority country approaches important elections.
Leaders of the rally urged people to defend Islam as protesters, many wearing white robes, chanted ""There is no God but Allah"" and waved black and white flags. 
""We want justice for the burning of the flag, for those who are responsible,"" said Fahruh Rozi, 47, a member of Forum Masjid Al Falah, one of a number of conservative groups at the rally.
""We want to raise awareness for respect for Islam. It's not to do with politics or elections,"" said Rozi, who wore a white shirt and skull cap with a black bandana bearing the creed.
Indonesia holds presidential and parliamentary elections next April and parties and candidates have been courting the votes from members of the dominant religion. 
President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, has sought to strengthen his ties with moderate Islamic leaders and appointed Islamic cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate. 
A loose grouping of Islamists were behind protests that culminated in the election defeat and jailing for blasphemy in 2017 of Jakarta's ethnic-Chinese and Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Widodo ally known as Ahok.
""The difference with the case of Ahok is that in this case there was a flag that was burned. We want to ensure this doesn't happen again. In Ahok's case it was blasphemy"", said Rozi. 
There have been sporadic tensions between more moderate organizations like NU, which says it has about 40 million members, and other more hardline groups. 

The flag burning happened in West Java after members of the youth wing of NU objected to a man carrying a flag from Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which is seeking an Islamic caliphate and has been banned in the country.

Bolsonaro maintained a solid lead in the Datafolha poll released Thursday night, taking 56 percent of voter intentions, compared to Haddad's 44 percent, but momentum is clearly shifting.
""It's impossible to say if there will be a continuous migration of votes (from Bolsonaro to Haddad) that would continue until the election on Sunday,"" Mauro Paulino, the head of Datafolha, wrote in an analysis of the latest poll and published in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper.
He added that only the next poll, to be published Saturday night, would give a solid indication if Haddad's momentum would have continued to gain steam.
The leftist Workers Party's (PT) candidate expressed his confidence on Twitter.
""I have some news for you,"" he tweeted on Thursday after the poll came out. ""Bolsonaro said last Sunday that he was going to sweep away the opposition. Well, he's not going to have an opposition because he will not be governing. We're going to win this.""
Bolsonaro and his campaign have repeatedly railed against polling results - even when they show him with a solid lead - as being fraudulent and favoring leftist candidates.
His backers have been so angered that Paulino has received thousands of threats of physical harm, mostly over social media, and has asked federal police to open an investigation.
Flavio Bolsonaro, who won a seat in the Senate in the Oct. 7 first-round ballot and is a close adviser of his father, dismissed the Datafolha institute's poll, saying it favored the PT and that ""our lead is far bigger!!!""
Bolsonaro's campaign has changed its tenor in recent days, after an Ibope poll also showed his lead slipping. 
On Thursday, he made the surprise announcement that if elected, he would not pull Brazil out of the Paris climate agreement, after saying he would. 
A seven-term congressman, Bolsonaro, 63, has successfully pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate, appealing to voters fed up with political graft and violent crime.
Haddad filled in last month for the PT's imprisoned founder, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who served two terms as president but is serving a 12-year sentence on a corruption conviction.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea agreed on Friday to ""completely destroy"" by next month 22 guard posts near their heavily fortified border, the latest advance in talks in the neighbors' effort to defuse military tension, Seoul's defense ministry said. 
It follows a military pact at a summit last month in the North Korean capital that called for a halt to ""all hostile acts,"" a no-fly zone near the border and the gradual removal of guard posts, firearms and landmines from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two.
As an initial step, the neighbors agreed to demolish 11 guard posts within 1 km (0.6 mile) of each side of the border and withdraw equipment and personnel stationed there by the end of November, the ministry said. 
""The measures will be finished through mutual verification in December,"" it said in a statement. 
The talks were led by South Korean Army Major General Kim Do-gyun and North Korean Lieutenant General An Ik San at the border village of Panmunjom within the DMZ. 
Both sides also discussed reinstating a joint military commission and forming a combined team to survey watercourses in the Han River their commercial ships could share.
The two sides also completed the removal of guard posts and firearms within the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom on Thursday, the ministry said. 
In another development, the South's military said it would stage two military drills next week.
That came after an agreement last week by Seoul and Washington to halt the Vigilant Ace air defense drills planned for December so as to give nuclear talks between the United States and North Korea every opportunity to continue, the Pentagon has said.
The allies delayed August's major annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises. 
To maintain defense readiness and boost military cooperation, South Korea has decided to carry out the Taeguk and Hoguk drills, its Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. 
The former is a command post exercise from Monday to Friday, while the latter is a field maneuver exercise that starts on Monday, centered on a river east of the capital, Seoul. 
""This year's exercise is to sustain balanced defense posture and improve the practice effects, considering the suspension of the Ulchi Freedom Guardian,"" the JCS said in a statement, referring to the annual exercise in which 17,500 U.S. forces joined South Korean troops last year.
The defense chiefs of South Korea and the United States will meet in Washington on Wednesday for an annual security consultative meeting, where they are expected to formally announce the suspension of the Vigilant Ace drills.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Friday hanged a Malaysian convicted of drug trafficking, the latest in what rights groups said was a series of executions prompting them to renew calls for the wealthy city-state to abolish the death penalty.
Singapore has some of the world's toughest anti-drugs laws, and airport customs forms warn arriving travelers of ""death for drug traffickers"" in no uncertain terms.
Human rights group Amnesty International and the U.N. Human Rights Office have urged Singapore to halt executions and follow the example of neighboring Malaysia, where a newly elected government has vowed to end capital punishment by year-end. 
""The execution was an unlawful and brutal act, carried out in breach of due process and in defiance of the appeals made by Malaysia,"" N. Surendran, the lawyer for the executed man, said in a statement.
Prabu N Pathmanathan, the Malaysian citizen, was hanged at dawn in the city state's Changi prison, he added. Malaysian Law Minister Liew Vui Keong had said this week that he planned to urge Singapore to exercise clemency. 
Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs did not immediately have comment.
Authorities in Singapore routinely do not comment on executions and only release data on executions in annual reports.
A regional representative of the United Nations Human Rights Office urged Singapore to immediately ban the death penalty as a step towards its complete abolition.
""We are deeply dismayed that there has been a sharp increase in executions in Singapore in recent years,"" said Cynthia Veliko, the U.N. official.
""We understand that there have ... been a number of executions to date in 2018, including a reported four this week alone.""
Amnesty International said the execution of another man, whose name had not been released, was imminent, citing reports of another man executed this week and three on Oct. 5, all for drug-related offences.
That compares with eight executions for drug-related offences in Singapore for all of 2017.
Although 15 countries prescribed the death penalty for drug-related offences in 2017, Amnesty recorded executions in only four - China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Singapore, it said in a statement. 
Pathmanathan was convicted of smuggling drugs from Malaysia into Singapore in 2014, court documents show.
""Yes, he broke the rules, but that doesn't mean you have to kill him,"" Magentrau Somalu, one of his close friends, told Reuters. ""He deserved a second chance.""

The 39-year-old, identified only by her surname Liu, launched the attack as children returned from morning exercises about 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT), police said on their official account on China's Twitter-like Weibo.
The victims were taken to hospital while guards and staff at the kindergarten restrained the attacker, said the police, adding that they were investigating. The statement did not give possible motives for the attack.
Violent crime is rare in China compared with many other countries, especially in major cities where security is tight, but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.
Such attacks are often blamed on people with mental illness or who have personal grievances. Knives are most commonly used, because gun controls are extremely strict in China.

In September, China executed a man convicted of killing nine students and injuring 11 in a knife attack at a middle school in the central province of Shaanxi.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar judge on Friday freed on bail three journalists from the country’s largest private newspaper detained on incitement charges after publishing an article that raised questions over government spending.
Eleven Media’s chief reporter, Phyo Wai Win, and two editors, Kyaw Zaw Lin and Nayi Min, were arrested on Oct. 10 following a complaint by the regional government in the commercial capital of Yangon. 
Their detention, in Insein prison on the outskirts of the city, marked the latest blow to press freedom in the country, where dozens of journalists have been prosecuted in recent months.
“As a reporter, I wrote my articles based on true information,” said Phyo Wai Win, as he walked free from the crowded courtroom in central Yangon's Tamwe township on Friday. The next hearing has been scheduled for Nov. 9.
Explaining her decision to grant bail, judge Tin War War Thein told the court the journalists did not pose a flight risk. 
“The punishment for the section is not a life sentence but two years maximum, and the accused are working at a journal based in Tamwe township, so they have no reason to run away,” she said.
The trio are facing charges under Section 505 (b) of the country’s colonial-era penal code, which prohibits publishing information that may “cause fear or alarm”, that could cause someone to commit an offense, or disrupt “public tranquility”. The charges carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison.
Days before their arrest, they had published a story that included quotes from lawmakers questioning the city’s use of funds, including the overhaul of transport.
Yangon’s regional government is headed by Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein, a protégé of Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and a member of her National League for Democracy party.
Last week, media reported, Myanmar President Win Myint ordered regional authorities to try to settle the dispute through negotiations with Myanmar’s Press Council, which has said the case must be dismissed before talks can start.
“According to that instruction, the Yangon regional government should have dismissed the case today,” said defense lawyer Kyee Myint.
The chief minister's assistant, Maung Maung Kyi, did not answer phone calls on Friday. Government spokesman Zaw Htay also could not be reached for comment. He recently said he would no longer respond to media requests, apart from in a biweekly press conference.
Human rights activists say press freedom in Myanmar has plummeted since Nobel laureate Suu Kyi took power in 2016 under a constitution that preserves the military's role in politics while formally ending decades of army rule.
A total of 38 journalists have faced charges under various laws since the start of her administration, freedom of expression group Athan said last month.
Two Reuters reporters were convicted last month of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison, drawing global condemnation. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were detained last December while investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims that took place during a military crackdown in western Rakhine state.
Also last month, a former newspaper columnist who was harshly critical of Suu Kyi on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was sentenced to seven years in prison for sedition.
In late 2016, the chief executive and another editor of Eleven Media were detained for nearly two months relating to a complaint made by Yangon Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein over a Facebook post alleging corruption in his ties with local businessmen. Phyo Min Thein told a news conference at the time that the allegations were “intended to defame my personal dignity”. Eleven Media published an apology.

Hundreds of excited local and foreign tourists barred from Boracay since April trooped to a jetty serving as the main gateway to the 10-square-kilometre (4-square-mile) island, which is famed for its sugary white sands, turquoise waters, lively nightlife and abundant water sports.
""We have already done the first phase, this is the rehabilitation. There is no more cesspool,"" environment minister, Roy Cimatu, told a news conference.
In April, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Boracay's closure after seeing a video of dirty water being piped out to sea, one of the side-effects of decades of unregulated construction that caused the collapse of its tiny sewerage system.
Boracay attracted two million visitors last year and raked-in $1 billion in revenues but was under heavy environmental stress, with garbage pile-ups, rampant land encroachment, and narrow roads filled with fumes from clogged traffic.
But the island is now turning over a new leaf.
Beach parties are now banned, as is smoking and drinking. Along the shoreline, there will be no more vendors, masseuses, fire dancers or watersports, and the scores of moored boats for years a fixture on the beach have been forced to anchor elsewhere.
Only 19,000 tourists will be now be allowed on the island on any given day, with the number of workers capped at 15,000 daily.
""When we think about it, our problem is everybody wants to go to Boracay,"" Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat told reporters on Friday.
The government plans to extend its restoration beyond Boracay to other tourist spots on the archipelago of over 7,000 islands, she said. 
GRAPHIC: Boracay Island to shut down IMG - https://tmsnrt.rs/2uThVRw 
Prior to the closure, authorities found about a third of the 600 to 700 resorts on Boracay were operating without permits. Some 157 hotels offering 7,308 rooms were allowed to operate starting Friday.
In the six-month closure, authorities removed illegal sewage pipes, closed or demolished unregistered hotels and expanded widened roads, although work is still ongoing.
Tourists arriving on Friday were greeted by, rubble, excavators and partially-knocked down buildings along roads, but there were flashes of Boracay's idyllic past for years obscured by crowds and commercial activities.
""Manage your expectations. The front is beautiful, the water is pristine and clear, but of course the roads are still being built,"" tourism minister Romulo-Puyat added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China has not asked for military access to Pakistan's Chinese-funded, deepwater port of Gwadar, a senior Pakistani rear admiral said on Friday, amid persistent speculation in India and the United States it could become a Chinese naval base.
Gwadar, in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, is the crown jewel of China's $60 billion investment in Belt and Road Initiative projects in Pakistan.
The plan is to turn Gwadar into a trans-shipment hub and megaport to be built alongside special economic zones from which export-focused industries will ship goods worldwide. A web of energy pipelines, roads and rail links will connect Gwadar to China's western regions.
Last year the Pentagon singled out Pakistan as a possible location for a future Chinese military base, though China has said that is pure speculation. Diplomatic and security sources see Gwadar as the likely location.
Speaking at the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing, which China styles as its answer to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Rear Admiral Javaid Iqbal, Navy Secretary of the Pakistan Navy, said Gwadar is a ""significant addition to the regional maritime landscape"".
""Let me emphasize that the Gwadar port is purely a commercial venture and has no military overtones,"" he told the forum.
""Suitably located outside the potentially risky and confined waters of the Gulf, Gwadar has the potential to act not only as a transit port for China and Central Asia but also a trans shipment port impacting the prosperity of the entire region,"" Iqbal added.
Speaking later to Reuters, he said he was very specific about the non-military nature of the port.
""The Gwadar port has no military dimension. It will be just a commercial port,"" Iqbal said. ""The Pakistan navy will maintain a presence to ensure maritime security, to ensure the security of the port.""
""The geopolitical debate that somehow goes on in the media about Gwadar being used as a foreign military base is not correct at all.""
Asked whether China had specifically asked for military access, he answered: ""No, not at all"".
China opened its first overseas military base, which it formally calls a logistics facility, in the Horn of Africa country Djibouti last year.
Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fueled worries in India that it would become another of China's ""string of pearls"" of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.
China has repeatedly downplayed expectations it could be about to embark on a plan to build military bases around the world, even as it ramps up an impressive military modernization program.

Meghan, 37, who became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Britain's Prince Harry in May, donned garlands of red flowers and a handmade wrap skirt called ta'ovala, given as a traditional sign of respect, on Friday as she and Harry, who also wore the traditional attire, toured the South Pacific nation of Tonga.
""I think our hearts just exploded! The #DukeandDuchessOfSussex in our national dress as they inspect traditional handicrafts,"" Twitter user Sulia Makasini wrote on her feed.
""What a historic moment for #Tonga.""
The red and white skirts, which the two wore over their normal clothes, spelled ""TONGA"" in flowers at the waist and won over excited crowds in the archipelago nation, and further afield.
""They're Tongan now. Love how they embrace our culture,"" wrote another Twitter user, Auburn Palu, from Auckland.
The country of some 170 reef-fringed tropical islands and 108,000 people is a former British colony.
The royal couple met Tongan Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pōhiva at a government building, funded by China but named the St George Building, in the capital, Nuku'alofa.
On the way in, Harry stopped to embrace a small boy holding a sign which said ""Free hugs!""
The pair, who are expecting a child of their own in the spring, were serenaded by students at Tupou College, and called in at the Royal Palace, feted everywhere by excited crowds waving flags and signs celebrating the visit. 
They laughed when boys from the college sang about mosquitoes, complete with dance moves, at a ceremony to dedicate two forest reserves on the campus, where they also inspected a caged black parrot.
School children later lined the route to the airport where the couple walked over a carpet of woven mats to their plane which left for Australia in the afternoon.
Earlier on their tour, the couple visited Fiji, where enormous crowds showed up to welcome them, and Australia where the public thronged the Sydney Opera House to catch a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth's grandson and his wife.
Meghan last week wore a white cocktail dress by Australian designer Karen Gee prompting such a rush of interest that the designer's website crashed several times.
They return to Australia before visiting New Zealand.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Human rights watchdog Amnesty said that a 10-hour raid at its southern Indian office by the financial crime investigating agency on Thursday was part of the government's attempts at ""silencing"" its critics.
The Enforcement Directorate searched Amnesty's Bengaluru office on suspicion that it had violated foreign direct investment guidelines and said that further investigations were ongoing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government has tightened surveillance on non-profit groups over the past four years, saying they are acting against India's interests. Licenses of thousands of foreign-funded groups, including one backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have been canceled or suspended on charges such as misreporting of donations.
Amnesty, which regularly accuses India of human rights violations in the restive Himalayan region of Kashmir, said more than five officials from the Enforcement Directorate raided its office, ordered employees to stay put and searched their desks.
Employees were told to shut their laptops and not allowed to use their phones to call friends and families, Amnesty said, adding it fully cooperated.
""ED raid on Amnesty India shows a disturbing pattern of the government silencing organizations that question power,"" it said on Twitter on Friday. ""It is clear that the government wants to instill fear among Civil Society Organisations.""
A government spokesman did not immediately reply to a text message seeking comment.
Critics says that the government has been using the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India's rapid economic development.
In 2015, the Ministry of Home Affairs put the New York-based Ford Foundation on a watch list and suspended environmental campaigner Greenpeace's license under India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).
Last year, the government banned foreign funding for the Public Health Foundation of India, backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, saying it used foreign donations to ""lobby"" for tobacco-control policy issues, ""which is prohibited under FCRA"".
In neighboring Pakistan, the government has ordered at least 18 international aid agencies, most of them working on human rights issues, to leave the country, drawing criticism from countries such as the United States.

Thirty seven people were rescued in a major operation involving helicopters and army and divers searching for survivors who had been swept from valleys to the shores of the area, the lowest point on earth, civil defense sources said.
Police chief Brigadier General Farid al Sharaa told state television the torrential rains swept away a bus carrying 44 children and teachers who were on a school trip picnicking in the popular destination. 
Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said it appeared the school had broken regulations by the ministry of education that banned trips to the Dead Sea due to bad weather.
There were an unknown number of people still missing, hospital sources said. 
A bridge on one of the cliffs of the Dead Sea had collapsed with the intensity of the rains, the first such heavy rains after the end of the summer season.
Families of victims were searching the rugged area after search teams suspended operations overnight for a few hours, a witness said. 

Neighboring Israel sent search-and-rescue helicopters to assist, an Israeli military statement said, adding the team dispatched at Amman's request was operating on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea.

Guards told him daily he'd be released, or gave him canned food but no opener.
Yasuda, who arrived home in Japan on Thursday from more than three years of what he called physical and psychological ""hell"", told the Asahi Shimbun daily that his captors accused him of being a spy.
Confined for eight months to a space just 1.5 meters high and 1 meter wide, he was not allowed to bathe, wash his clothes, or make any kind of noise or movement.
""Because I couldn't wash my hair, my head itched - but when I scratched, that made noise,"" he told the Asahi during his flight back to Japan.
""Breathing through my nose, cracking my knuckles, moving while I slept - everything was forbidden.""
The rigid control of his daily life got even tighter after he was accused of ""eavesdropping"" while making a noise as he relieved himself.
At one point, he didn't eat for 20 days in an effort to avoid any movement.
""I was skin and bones, horribly nauseated. If it had gone on much longer, I would probably have died, but I was finally moved to a different place,"" he said.
""They would not bring me food, or if they did give me canned food, they would not bring a can opener,"" he said.
A week before his release, he was moved back to the narrow space of his worst days, then to a cell in what appeared to be an ordinary house. 
The following day, he was put in a car and driven to the Turkish border.
Gaunt and bearded, wearing a black T-shirt and dark trousers, Yasuda gave reporters a strained smile upon his arrival in Japan but said nothing.
His wife told a news conference that any further comments would have to wait until he had rested and undergone medical checks.
""I'm happy that I can return to Japan. At the same time, I don’t know what will happen from here or what I should do,” Yasuda told Reuters on a Turkish domestic flight, before he flew home from Istanbul.
The Japanese government has thanked Qatar and Turkey for their cooperation in freeing Yasuda, but has denied paying a ransom for his release.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two male penguins entrusted with the care of a fostered egg have welcomed a tiny sub-Antarctic Gentoo chick into the world, Sydney's Sea Life Aquarium said on Friday.
The pair, Magic and Sphen, made headlines around the world this month when aquarium staff gave them the egg, following a successful trial with a dummy egg.
The yet-to-be-named chick, weighing 91 gm (3.21 oz), was born on the evening of Oct. 19 and is the first sub-Antarctic penguin born at the aquarium.
The couple, who formed a bond before the 2018 breeding season, doted on the adopted chick, said Tish Hannan, an aquarium official.
""The first 20 days of a penguin chick's life are the most vulnerable, so it is extra-important the chick is very happy, healthy and well fed by his parents,"" she added.
Magic and Sphen had placed the egg on small nesting rings built with pebbles and shared duties, with one patrolling for possible threats, while the other kept the egg warm.
There is little difference between opposite-sex and same-sex rearing among Gentoo penguins, which share parenting and feeding responsibilities equally, Hannan said prior to the birth, adding that the example was not the first among zoos across the world.
A children's book, ""And Tango Makes Three"", based on the real story of two penguins at New York's Central Park Zoo who reared their own chick, drew acclaim from some for its depiction of non-traditional family structures.
It was also among the titles Hong Kong pulled from bookshelves in public libraries this year, following pressure from anti-gay groups, the South China Morning Post newspaper has said.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Greece jolted by powerful quake but virtually unscathed,"By Angeliki Koutantou and Michele Kambas
ATHENS (Reuters) - A powerful quake of magnitude at least 6.4 struck off western Greece early on Friday, earthquake monitors said, causing slight damage but no casualties in a tremor felt as far away as Libya.
Greece's Geodynamic Institute reported the magnitude as 6.4, and put the quake 50 km (31 miles) south of the island of Zakynthos. That compares with a figure of 6.8 assessed by both the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).
The tremor was felt in Athens, the Greek capital, and as far away as Albania, Italy, Libya and Malta.
The epicenter was in the Ionian Sea, about 130 km (81 miles) southwest of Patras in the Peloponnese, the USGS said.
It was felt particularly on Zakynthos, also known as Zante, which was rattled by a series of strong aftershocks, the highest at 5.6, and where power was briefly disrupted. 
Three people were taken to hospital, two of them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece's civil protection agency told Reuters. 
News websites said a 15th-century monastery had been damaged, with one, Zante News Time, displaying images of masonry that had fallen from a building facade and items dislodged from shelves in shops. 
The power cut and slight damage to the port of Zakynthos, near the epicenter would not affect port operations, officials said.
""We are not facing any particular problems,"" Zakynthos Mayor Pavlos Kolokotsas told Greek state broadcaster ERT. ""Calm is being restored.""
Italy's Il Messaggero online news site said the quake had been felt hundreds of kilometers away in southern Italy. Firefighters in Calabria, Puglia and Sicily received thousands of telephone calls seeking information about the quake.
""The energy unleashed, based on the angle of the faultline, fanned out towards Italy,"" said Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece's Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization.
Extensive damage was avoided because quake-prone Zakynthos had adopted seismic protection codes in construction, he added.
An official confirmed that a tsunami alert had been lifted. The EMSC European quake agency said sea levels had risen slightly, by about 20 cm (7.87 inches), but the increase could be higher locally.
The quake was fairly shallow, according to the USGS, just 14 km (8.7 miles) below the seabed, which would have amplified shaking.
It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT). Greece straddles two tectonic plates and often suffers earthquakes.

490,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",Saudis Come Close to Admitting Khashoggi Murder Was Planned,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi authorities came close to acknowledging that the murder of insider-turned-critic Jamal Khashoggi was premeditated as pressure mounted on the kingdom to provide a credible explanation to the killing that roiled its ties with the West and spooked investors.
The Saudi prosecution has received information from Turkish investigators suggesting that the suspects intended to kill the Washington Post columnist, and will continue its probe in light of those findings, the official Saudi Press Agency said on Thursday.
Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel briefed U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday following a quick trip to Turkey this week. The Washington Post reported that Haspel heard an audio tape allegedly made of Khashoggi’s interrogation and killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The CIA declined to comment when asked whether Haspel heard any such recording. A Turkish official said the Washington Post report was accurate. The White House would only say Haspel “briefed the President on their findings and her discussions.”
Saudi Arabia’s shifting narrative over what happened to Khashoggi has prompted an international outcry and left its main allies demanding answers. The Trump administration is facing rising pressure to act against its Arab ally and the president has appeared to be stepping back from giving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman his full support. The U.S. has long been Saudi Arabia’s most important partner and Trump has made the kingdom the centerpiece of his efforts to isolate Iran.
After denying his death for nearly three weeks, the kingdom last week said the 59-year-old was accidentally killed after a discussion at the consulate turned into an altercation. Officials and the crown prince’s supporters said the suspects tried to cover up their crime and provided the leadership with misleading accounts of the murder.
Authorities, however, haven’t explained why his body is still missing or how a meeting in a diplomatic compound grew violent. Turkish police took a water sample from a well at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, Hurriyet newspaper reported.
One of Khashoggi’s sons, Salah, who was pictured shaking hands with the Saudi king and crown prince this week, has left the kingdom, according to two people close to the family. They spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to disclose the destination.
On Tuesday, Trump called the evolving stories over Khashoggi’s fate -- the crown prince initially said the columnist left the consulate on his own -- “one of the worst in the history of cover-ups.”
Changing Stories
Saudi Arabia has said that 18 people have been arrested in connection with the case. A senior intelligence official and an adviser to Prince Mohammed were also removed from their jobs.
The prince on Wednesday made his first public comments since his government admitted Khashoggi had been killed. Speaking at an investment forum he was hosting in Riyadh, he called the killing a “heinous crime” and vowed to punish the culprits and overhaul the security services. He offered no new information on what happened.
Damping speculation he could be pushed aside, the prince appeared relaxed, ebullient and conciliatory toward Turkey, which has stopped just short of blaming him for the killing.
“Saudi Arabia is carrying out all of the legal procedures to investigate and present the guilty to trial,” the crown prince told his audience. “Many are trying to take advantage of this painful incident to divide the two [Turkey and Saudi Arabia], but they won’t be able to do so.”
In a speech timed to coincide with the start of the three-day international business conference, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the Saudi narrative and said Khashoggi’s murder was planned in Riyadh. He demanded the culprits be punished no matter how senior.
Growing Pressure
French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call with King Salman on Wednesday, “expressed his deep indignation and asked the king that all light be shed on the circumstances that led to this drama.” France “will not hesitate to take, in links with its partners, international sanctions against the culprits,” Macron said in a statement.
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said if any Saudis named in relation to the death had visas to enter Britain they’d be revoked. That followed a similar vow from the U.S. a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with King Salman on Thursday, the Kremlin said, focusing on bilateral ties, a possible Putin visit to Saudi Arabia and the “Khashoggi affair,” according to a statement.
In an effort to carry out one of the changes the kingdom said was needed as a response to the Khashoggi killing, Prince Mohammed chaired the first meeting of a committee to restructure the general intelligence agency, SPA reported. The committee discussed a reform plan and made recommendations, it said, without giving details.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Peru opposition vows to halt clashes as leader faces jailtime,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's most powerful conservative party vowed on Thursday to stop engaging in disputes with other political groups, a dramatic opposition shift that could help President Martin Vizcarra pass legislation.
Once emboldened by its solid Congress majority won in the 2016 election despite losing the presidency, the party, Popular Force, is in crisis as its leader Keiko Fujimori faces three years in jail over charges she denies.
Fujimori has tasked an ""emergency committee"" with rebuilding the party after a handful of its top leaders resigned this week.
In a rare mea culpa, Popular Force Congresswoman Ursula Letona, a panel member, said the party should have focused more on lawmaking in the past two years, which were marked by hostilities between the executive and legislative branches that led the former president to resign in March.
""We did many things, but we also fell into the confrontation game and that was a political mistake we acknowledge,"" Letona said, without mentioning specifics. 
""We aim to return to the path we started in Congress of proposing a series of reforms for Peru, an agenda.""
But it was unclear who would lead Popular Force if a judge orders this week that Fujimori, 43, be jailed before trial for up to three years to ensure she does not flee or obstruct a criminal inquiry.
It was time Fujimori step down as party president, said One Popular Force lawmaker, Rolando Reategui, who admitted this week to being an informant for prosecutors. 
'NATURAL LEADER'
A twice-defeated presidential candidate and the daughter of former autocrat Alberto Fujimori, Fujimori denies prosecutors' allegations that she used Popular Force to launder money for Brazilian builder Odebrecht during her 2011 campaign.
She has described her legal troubles as political persecution but said she would never flee. ""I'll face this process in the name of the truth, in the name of my party and in the name of my family,"" Fujimori told the court on Thursday.
An unfavorable ruling could dash Fujimori's chances of winning the presidency in mid-2021 elections, opening the way for outsiders to sweep to power in the world's No.2 copper producer and one of Latin America's strongest economies.
The judge assigned to the case, Richard Concepcion, has ordered two former presidents to so-called ""preventive prison,"" or pre-trial detention in connection with Odebrecht, which has been at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal.
The investigation into Fujimori and her campaign finances has also rippled out into other institutions. 
The head of Peru's tax agency announced his resignation on Thursday after the lead prosecutor on the case suggested he helped Fujimori launder illegal funds from Odebrecht. He has previously denied wrongdoing.
Outgoing Popular Force Secretary General Jose Chlimper told Reuters he was taking leave as a director of Peru's central bank to fight an accusation against him that surfaced at the hearing.
Fujimori's approval rating fell to 11 percent in a Datum poll on Thursday, below the 12 percent for Antauro Humala, an ethnic nationalist in prison for murder.
But many Popular Force lawmakers have defended her.

""Right now Keiko Fujimori is the natural leader of Popular Force,"" said Congresswoman Alejandra Aramayo. ""She's always shown willingness to cooperate with investigations and justice. She's always respected different positions.""

The decision allows the company to restart its Ikata No. 3 reactor on Saturday, after the Hiroshima High Court, in late September, lifted an injunction of December 2017 blocking operations of the 890-megawatt reactor.
In line with the High Court decision, the Hiroshima District Court in western Japan rejected the lawsuit filed by residents, most of them from the Hiroshima prefecture, the company said. 
The reactor has been shut since October 2017 for scheduled maintenance. Other units at the site are set for decommissioning.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 09:08PM ET</span>",UK said Assange would not be extradited: Ecuador's top attorney,"By Alexandra Valencia
QUITO (Reuters) - The United Kingdom told Ecuador in August that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange would not be extradited if he left the country's London embassy, where he has lived under asylum since 2012, Ecuador's top government attorney said on Thursday.
In a written response to queries from Ecuador, the UK explained that it had not received any extradition request, and said Assange's jail time in the UK for violating bail terms by seeking refuge in the embassy would not exceed six months, Iñigo Salvador, who represents the Ecuadorean government in court proceedings, told reporters. 
Salvador said Ecuador passed on the UK's response to Assange's lawyers, but noted that if Assange stayed in the embassy Ecuador would put new conditions on his stay.
""Mr. Assange had a choice between turning himself in to British authorities with those assurances, or staying in the embassy of Ecuador, but given that the asylum had lasted six years with no signs of immediate resolution we were going to place certain rules,"" Salvador said at a news conference.
It was unclear if the UK's assurances were still valid. Assange's legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office referred to Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan's June statement that Assange would be treated ""humanely and properly"" if he left the embassy. 
Assange took refuge in the embassy after British courts ordered his extradition to Sweden to face questioning in a sexual molestation case. That case has been dropped, but supporters have said that Assange fears he could be extradited to the United States if he leaves the embassy.
WikiLeaks, which published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets when Assange ran the operation, faces a U.S. grand jury investigation.
The relationship between Assange and Ecuador has grown increasingly tense in the past year. Assange filed a lawsuit in an Ecuadorean court last week claiming the new asylum terms, which require him to pay for medical bills and telephone calls and to clean up after his pet cat, violate his rights.
Ecuador says the rules are consistent with international asylum standards.
Ecuador's foreign minister, José Valencia, told Reuters earlier this week that he was ""frustrated"" by Assange's decision to file suit, and said the South American country would no longer intervene on his behalf in talks with Britain over his situation, a break from previous practice.
On Thursday, Salvador refuted Assange's claims in the suit that Ecuador prevented him from receiving visitors, denied him counsel and cut off access to communications, noting that he received 62 visits between July and October, including some from his lawyers.
An initial hearing in the case had been scheduled for Thursday, but the presiding judge suspended it after the video conference that was supposed to beam Assange into the courtroom faltered.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Robert Durst, the subject of an HBO documentary, ""The Jinx,"" must stand trial in the 2000 murder of his longtime friend, a judge ruled on Thursday at a hearing interrupted at times by outbursts from Durst.
Durst, a 75-year-old multi-millionaire, was arrested in 2015 and charged with murder in the shooting death of his confidante Susan Berman.
Prosecutors say Durst killed Berman because she could implicate him in the murder of his wife, who vanished in 1982 when the couple was living in New York City.
The grandson of a wealthy New York real estate tycoon has pleaded innocent to Berman's murder. He will have a chance to again enter a plea at a second arraignment scheduled for Nov. 8.
Los Angeles Judge Mark Windham, at the conclusion of a nearly two-week preliminary hearing during which prosecutors presented evidence, ordered Durst to stand trial on a charge of murder with the special circumstances that he used a gun and killed a witness by ambushing her.
Windham said Durst had incriminated himself through his own statements, including comments he made in interviews for ""The Jinx."" 
""I order defendant to be held to answer therefore without bail until date of his arraignment,"" the judge said. 
If convicted, Durst faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Durst repeatedly interrupted the hearing. At one point, during a pause in proceedings, he rolled backward in his wheelchair toward the nearest door and said: ""And away we go. Bye! Have a good weekend!"" The bailiff and one of his attorneys stopped him.
Attorneys for Durst argued on Thursday there was insufficient justification for a trial, with no fingerprints or DNA evidence linking him to Berman's death. 
'SUCCINCT CONFESSION'
Berman, 55, was found dead in Los Angeles at her home on Dec. 24, 2000, shortly after it was revealed that police had reopened an investigation into the disappearance 18 years earlier of Durst's wife, Kathleen Durst. 
Durst has never been charged with killing his wife and her body has not been found. 
Durst's ties to Berman's death, his wife's disappearance and a 2001 Texas slaying for which he was acquitted by a jury were explored in ""The Jinx,"" a six-part series. 
In the finale, which aired in 2015, Durst was caught on microphone talking to himself, saying: ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" 
""It's cryptic,"" Windham said on Thursday, in reference to Durst's recorded comment. ""But without explanation from the defendant, it operates as a succinct confession to murders with which he's been confronted.""
Windham also said he was swayed by Durst's admissions that he approved of the accuracy of 2010 feature film ""All Good Things,"" which was directed by the filmmaker who made ""The Jinx"" and was based on Durst's life. 
Durst's approving statements about ""All Good Things"" were significant because the film portrayed Durst as a killer, prosecutors said in court papers submitted on Tuesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European members of NATO urged the United States on Thursday to try to bring Russia back into compliance with a nuclear arms control treaty rather than quit it, diplomats said, seeking to avoid a split in the alliance that Moscow could exploit.
In a closed-door meeting at NATO, Pentagon, U.S. State Department and National Security Council officials briefed alliance envoys on U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which rid Europe of land-based nuclear missiles.
Diplomats present said Germany and other European allies called for a final effort on Washington's part to convince the Kremlin to stop what the West says are violations, or possibly renegotiate it to include China.
""Allies want to see a last-ditch effort to avoid a U.S. withdrawal,"" one NATO diplomat said on condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the meeting, which took place two days after senior U.S. official John Bolton informed Russian President Vladimir Putin of the plans in Moscow.
""Nobody takes issue with Russia's violation of the treaty, but a withdrawal would make it easy for Moscow to blame us for the end of this landmark agreement,"" a second diplomat said. 
NATO declined to comment on the details of the meeting but issued a statement saying that allies assessed ""the implications of Russia's destabilizing behavior on our security.""
""NATO allies will continue to consult on this important issue,"" it added.
Earlier this week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg laid the blame on Russia for violating the treaty by developing the SSC-8, a land-based, intermediate-range Cruise missile which also has the name of Novator 9M729.
Russia denies any such violations.
NATO allies including Belgium and the Netherlands, which host U.S. nuclear weapons facilities in Europe, warned in the North Atlantic Council, NATO's highest decision-making body, of a public outcry if the United States were to try to install medium-range nuclear weapons on their territory again.
Stoltenberg said on Wednesday he did not think this would lead to reciprocal deployments of U.S. missiles in Europe as happened in the 1980s.
European allies see the INF treaty as a pillar of arms control and, while accepting that Moscow is violating it by developing new weapons, are concerned its collapse could lead to a new arms race with possibly a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles stationed on the continent.
Diplomats said the U.S. officials did hold out the possibility that the United States may delay its formal withdrawal to after a planned meeting between Putin and Trump in Paris on Nov. 11.

The treaty foresees a six-month notification period for any withdrawal, also potentially giving Washington time to negotiate with Moscow before finally pulling out.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday its commitment to uphold a peace treaty with Israel was not in question despite ending a 25-year special regime that allows its neighbor to use two parcels of land along its borders under its sovereignty.
Jordan formally notified Israel on Sunday it would not renew the deal over Baquora where the Yarmouk River flows into the Jordan River and in the Ghumar area in the southern Wadi Araba desert where Israeli farmers have large plantations.
King Abdullah, who stressed the territories were Jordanian lands and would remain so, said the move was made in the ""national interest"" at a period of regional turmoil. 
Under the peace treaty, the two areas were recognized to be under Jordanian sovereignty but gave Israel special provisions to use the land and allow Israelis free access, while in the Baquora area Israeli private property rights were respected.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the deal, which was signed in November 1994, had been conceived as a temporary arrangement from the start. 
""That is why there was a time cap on it ... We acted within the provisions of the peace treaty. This is an indication of our commitment to the peace treaty. There has never been a question of our solid commitment to the treaty,"" Safadi told Reuters.
Jordan is one of only two Arab states that has a peace treaty with Israel and the two countries have a long history of close security ties. But the treaty is unpopular and pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread in Jordan.
Safadi said the kingdom had contemplated the move for a while before the Nov. 10 deadline.
Under the peace treaty, the deal would be automatically renewed unless either of the parties notified the other a year before expiry that it wished to terminate the agreement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Jordan's move and said his country sought to enter negotiations on the possibility of extending the arrangement. 
The kingdom was now awaiting Israel invoking a provision in the treaty to hold consultations after giving notice before the deadline, Safadi said.
""There will be no negotiations over sovereignty. But we will fulfill our obligation to engage in consultations to implement the termination ...,"" Safadi added.
The monarch's move was hailed by parliamentarians who have been vocal against a renewal they say was humiliating and perpetuates Israeli “occupation” of Jordanian territory.
Safadi said Jordan would respect its obligations toward Israelis in the peace treaty that demarcated borders for the first time since the creation of Israel in 1948.

""We will fulfill our legal commitments in a manner that recognize whatever rights there are for Israel, particularly the property rights. We will respect these rights in accordance with Jordanian laws that respects private property of non-Jordanians,"" Safadi added.

MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered outside the Almudena Roman Catholic Cathedral in central Madrid on Thursday to demonstrate against any plans to bury the remains of former dictator Francisco Franco at the site.
Families of the tens of thousands of his opponents who were killed or imprisoned during his near four-decade rule oppose his burial at such an emblematic site.
Spanish lawmakers voted in September to remove the remains of Franco from a mausoleum where tens of thousands of victims of the 1936-39 civil war that brought him to power are also laid to rest. 
It is still not known where his remains will be transferred to. But the Franco family has a crypt at the cathedral and Franco's daughter is buried there.
People chanted 'Criminal out of the cathedral' and carried placards reading 'Madrid: Without Franco' and 'Justice!'
""I would chuck him in a ditch,"" said 74-year-old protestor Gorgonio Ferrero outside the cathedral. ""But not (buried) here.""
The plans to move Franco's remains have divided Spanish society. Several of his descendants have expressed opposition to the exhumation. 
The Francisco Franco Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that promotes the memory of the former dictator, has said that his remains should be given a Christian burial at the Madrid cathedral. 
The government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hopes the exhumation will help settle grievances from the period of his rule that still cast a shadow over the country. As many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the Spanish civil war.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>","Egypt's PM envisages fewer civil servants, smaller cabinet","By Yousef Saba
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's prime minister said on Thursday he was working on a government restructuring that envisages a smaller cabinet and fewer civil servants to cut red tape and lure foreign investment.
Speaking at a U.S. business gathering in Cairo, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said Egypt's major challenges lie in chronic bureaucracy and a high birth rate.
Egypt, a leading regional ally of the United States, has been implementing deep reforms under a $12 billion IMF loan deal agreed in 2016 aimed at attracting foreign investment. Under the IMF deal, Egypt devalued its currency and has been gradually cutting fuel subsidies in moves that have deepened poverty.
The reforms have helped turn around the economy, with growth in the current fiscal year that began in July expected at around 5.2 percent.
But experts say the country needs to undertake major government restructuring and to curb its population growth rate if it wants to cash in on the economic reforms.
""We have a plan to reform the government,"" Madbouly told U.S. businessmen.
""We are working now through the ministry of planning and…the ministry of telecommunications to a structural reform of the government,"" he said. He added that he believed there was a need to cut the number of cabinet posts in the government and ""at least 38 percent of employees in the public sector will be retired in the next 10 years.""
""So this means at least 35-38 percent will be retired and our plan to replace them is very hard,"" he said.
Madbouly said that the restructuring proposals were linked to plans to move the seat of government to a new administrative capital under construction some 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo scheduled for next year.
Starting at the beginning of 2019, Madbouly said many government services will be available online.
Madbouly, appointed in June after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi began his second term in office, also said that population growth in Egypt was another leading challenge. 
The country is already the most populous in the Arab world with nearly 100 million citizens and is expected to reach 128 million by 2030 if fertility rates of 4.0 births per thousand women per year continue, according to government figures.

Madbouly said his government was working on a plan to curb the country's birth rate. ""We don't have any other option,"" he said, without giving any details.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 02:56PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia now says Khashoggi murder 'premeditated',"DUBAI/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said on Thursday the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate this month was premeditated, reversing previous official statements that the killing was unintended.
The death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sparked global outrage and mushroomed into a crisis for the world's top oil exporter and strategic ally of the West.
The Saudi disclosure came after CIA director Gina Haspel heard an audio recording of the killing during a fact-finding visit to Turkey this week. The spy chief was due to brief President Donald Trump about Khashoggi on Thursday.
Saudi officials initially denied having anything to do with Khashoggi's disappearance after he entered the consulate on Oct. 2, before changing the official account to say an internal investigation suggested he was accidentally killed in a botched operation to return him to the kingdom.
On Thursday, Saudi state TV quoted the Saudi public prosecutor as saying the killing was premeditated, and that prosecutors were interrogating suspects on the basis of information provided by a joint Saudi-Turkish task force.
""Information from the Turkish side affirms that the suspects in Khashoggi's case premeditated their crime,"" said the statement carried by state TV.
Turkey and Western allies of Riyadh have voiced deep scepticism about Saudi explanations of the killing.
Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, 59, was killed inside the consulate by Saudi agents and his body cut up. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting the murder.
Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the audio, has said his torturers cut off his fingers during an interrogation and later beheaded him.
The CIA's Haspel heard an audio recording of Khashoggi's death during a trip to Turkey this week, sources told Reuters. It was not clear what could be heard. Representatives for the CIA and Turkish intelligence declined to comment.
It was the first indication Ankara has shared its key investigative evidence.
""We have shared with those who sought additional information some of the information and findings that the prosecutor has allowed us to share,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters, without giving details.
Trump, the kingdom's staunchest Western ally, was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying Prince Mohammed bore ultimate responsibility for the operation that led to Khashoggi's death. 
INTELLIGENCE RESTRUCTURING
How Western allies deal with Riyadh will hinge on the extent to which they believe responsibility for Khashoggi's death lies directly with the prince and the Saudi authorities.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the killing in the strongest terms possible during a phone call with King Salman, and vowed to take appropriate measures in response, the chancellery said.
Saudi Arabia has detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of the investigation into Khashoggi's murder. Some were members of a 15-man hit team, many of them Saudi intelligence operatives, who flew into Istanbul hours before Khashoggi's death, Turkish security sources say.
Turkish police were investigating water samples from a well at the consulate on Thursday after initially being denied access, broadcaster CNN Turk said.
King Salman, who has delegated the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to the crown prince, on Saturday ordered a restructuring of the general intelligence agency.
Saudi state news agency SPA said on Thursday that Prince Mohammed had presided over the first meeting of a committee to carry out that restructuring.
The prince promised on Wednesday the killers would be brought to justice, his first public comments on the matter.
Khashoggi's eldest son, Salah, and his family arrived on Thursday in Washington on a flight from Saudi Arabia, according to two sources close to the family. One source said Salah Khashoggi holds dual U.S.-Saudi citizenship and had been under a travel ban.
This week he held a meeting at the al Yamama Palace in Riyadh in which he and other family members received condolences from King Salman and the crown prince.
A photograph of the meeting showed Salah staring coldly at the prince as the pair shook hands.
Dozens of people gathered outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Thursday in a vigil to demand justice. Several carried cardboard images of his face and signs reading ""Khashoggi's friends"". One, his hands painted red, wore a mask depicting the face of Prince Mohammed.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has called Khashoggi's murder a ""savage killing"" and demanded Riyadh punish those responsible, no matter how highly placed. 
Saudi Arabia is the lynchpin of a U.S.-backed regional bloc against Iran but the crisis has strained Riyadh's relations with the West. Dozens of Western officials, bankers and company executives shunned a big investment conference in Riyadh this week.
But striking a defiant tone, the crown prince told international investors at the three-day conference on Wednesday that the furor would not derail the kingdom's reform drive.

""We will prove to the world that the two governments (Saudi and Turkish) are cooperating to punish any criminal, any culprit, and at the end justice will prevail,"" he said to applause.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Iraq's new PM struggles at first hurdle: forming a government,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed Aboulenein
Sulaimaniya, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's new premier Adel Abdul Mahdi has had an early taste of the partisan politics he hopes to rein in, failing so far to win parliament's approval of a full government to begin to tackle the destruction of years of war and rampant corruption. 
At a heated session on Wednesday night, MPs rejected key cabinet picks and accused some nominees of links to late dictator Saddam Hussein.
The session ended after midnight with Abdul Mahdi sworn in as prime minister but with only a part-government, extending the wrangling over power that has followed an inconclusive election in May.
Iraq's defense and interior ministers and six others have yet to be decided before the government can address daunting challenges.
The oil-rich country has suffered for decades under the rule of Saddam and U.N. sanctions, the U.S. invasion and civil war it unleashed, and the battle against Islamic State (IS), which was declared won last year. Graft is widespread and basic services like power and water lacking.
Rivalry between the two blocs that emerged strongest from the election - an Iran-backed alliance and a populist bloc led by former firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - could prove particularly difficult for the prime minister to manage.
Abdul Mahdi told journalists on Thursday there had been ""political differences"" in approving his cabinet, but that having it partly in place was better than missing the constitutional deadline of Nov. 2.
""Abdul Mahdi came under tremendous pressure from party leaders ... he submitted to the moods of parties by nominating partisan ministers,"" said Huda Sajjad, of outgoing premier Haider al-Abadi's Victory list.
Victory came in third in May.
Sajjad said the choice of ministers undermined Abdul Mahdi's promises to appoint a government of independent technocrats - a key demand of the Sadrist-led bloc.
Parliament approved Abdul Mahdi's government program, which aims to reform government institutions, bring semi-autonomous militias under state control and streamline the oil sector of OPEC's second largest producer.
But personalities were the sticking point.
Lawmakers walked out before parliament could vote on defense nominee Faisal al-Jarba. MPs circulated a photo of him smiling alongside Saddam, who was toppled by the 2003 U.S. invasion.
Abdul Mahdi's proposed communications minister was also accused of being a Saddam stalwart in a document leaked during the session. Other choices were alleged by some parties to be corrupt.
""The prime minister put forward ministers who aren't fit for the job,"" said Sabah al-Saidi, a lawmaker for the Sadrist-led bloc, Saeroon.
Saeroon campaigned on an anti-corruption platform that appealed to many poor Iraqis made destitute by conflict or squeezed by unemployment.
MUTUAL REJECTION
Sadr, in a Tweet, urged MPs not to approve ministerial candidates seen as partisan or sectarian.
Politicians linked to Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias, however, feel they have earned a right to be in the incoming government given the big role they played alongside Iraqi forces in defeating Islamic State militarily last year.
""Rejecting Faleh al-Fayad as interior minister was not justified. He led the Hashid Shaabi (an alliance of militias) in defeating Daesh (IS) and this is the least reward he should get,"" an MP affiliated with the Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia said.
""In return we objected to their (Saeroon and Victory) candidates.""
Iraq's new prime minister will have to contend with the zero-sum game that has dominated politics for years, according to analysts.
""It's hard to see how if the big political parties demand posts which they view as their livelihood, how they could just be excluded,"" said Renad Mansour, research fellow at Chatham House in London.
Abdul Mahdi and new President Barham Salih ""are going to face a lot of pressure - we've seen that in the appointment process"", he said.
Parliament is to vote again on Nov. 6 to approve the remainder of Abdul Mahdi's 22-member cabinet. He currently has 14 ministers. He said on Thursday a complete cabinet would soon be in place.
The United States welcomed the new government. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Abdul Mahdi on Thursday to congratulate him, his office said.
One Western diplomat in Baghdad said Abdul Mahdi had scored victories in some key appointments, such as Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban and Finance Minister Fuad Hussein.

Burundi's Ambassador to the United Nations Albert Shingiro, speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, rubbished a report by the Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Burundi. 
His government has already criticized the report several times and refused to cooperate with the investigators. 
According to a transcript posted on the Burundian mission's website, tweeted by Shingiro, he called the commission's Senegalese chairman Doudou Diène ""an African tasked with selling another African country at auction"".
""Unfortunately it's not the first time that it's happened, we saw Africans selling other Africans during the era of slavery and colonialism,"" Shingiro added.
Bachelet said in a statement his ""comments were ""deeply regrettable in both tone and substance"". 
The Commission of Inquiry led by Diène was set up in 2016 and published a detailed 272-page report earlier this year that said Burundi's government and its supporters were responsible for crimes against humanity.
Burundi has called the report ""lies"" and threatened to sue its critics, including the three commissioners. 
""The threat to prosecute the members of the Commission for the work they have done at the express request of the Council – a subsidiary body of the General Assembly - is unacceptable and should be immediately withdrawn,"" Bachelet said.
""And the personal attack on the Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, Mr Doudou Diène, comparing him to a participant in the slave trade, was a disgrace,"" she added.

""Burundi’s belligerent and defamatory response to the findings of the Commission of Inquiry, and its repeated and wholly unsupported assertions that the Commission was the puppet of mysterious external forces, as well as the Government’s complete failure to address the very serious findings of the Commission of Inquiry, are reprehensible.""

A Scottish parliamentary vote would not be binding on the UK parliament but would potentially embarrass Prime Minister Theresa May, underscoring the low in relations between London and Edinburgh over Brexit and potentially feeding Scottish nationalism.
Britain voted overall 52-48 percent to leave the EU in 2016 but Scotland, one of its four nations, voted 62-38 percent to stay in the EU.
Britain is due to leave the EU in March and ministers say a deal is close. But Brexit talks are stalled due to a disagreement over the border between British province Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, and hampered by internal wrangling in May's minority government.
Many, including Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, fear this could scupper an overall deal, hampering trade and causing economic uncertainty.
""On this most crucial of matters, Scotland must be and will be heard,"" Russell told Scotland's Holyrood parliament. 
""If the UK government puts the option of staying in the EU single market and customs union on the table, we will commit ourselves to support it. We will reject every other option short of staying in the EU,"" Russell said, spelling out the Scottish government's commitment to the single market.
He added: ""If a withdrawal agreement and political declaration are in the end concluded and offered to (Britain's lower chamber) the House of Commons, then we make this commitment: before the Westminster parliament votes on that deal, the Scottish government will seek to ensure the Scottish parliament will pass its own judgment on it.""

The United States said the person targeted by sanctions, Tan Wee Beng, a director and shareholder of a Singapore-based commodities trading company, Wee Tiong Holdings Pte Ltd, hid the origins of payments and structured transactions to fulfill millions of dollars in North Korean contracts since at least 2011.
The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on two vessels tied to a different company for which Tan is a managing director, and which the United States says engaged in illicit economic activity connected to North Korea.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's Constitutional Court struck down on Thursday dozens of changes to the criminal code made by the ruling Social Democrats that had been criticized by the European Union, diplomats and magistrates.
The changes are part of a series of legal and personnel changes made by the Social Democrats in the two years since they took power that are seen as threats to judicial independence and could further heighten European Union concerns about democratic values in some of its eastern member states.
The top court rejected a slew of the changes made to the criminal code, but details of its decision will be released at a later date.
Earlier this month, the court also rejected about 70 percent of changes made to criminal procedures that were challenged and that would have raised the burden of proof. 
Both bills will now return to parliament for discussion.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels has been keeping its justice system under special monitoring since its 2007 entry. 
The EU, who is already seeking sanctions against Poland and Hungary for weakening the rule of law are concerned Romania is following suit.
Prosecutors have secured a spate of convictions in recent years against lawmakers, ministers and mayors, including Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea. Their investigations have exposed conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and awarding of state contracts in exchange for bribes.
On Wednesday, Romania's justice minister demanded the dismissal of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in the anti-corruption drive that has won praise from Brussels for exposing high-level corruption, including the theft of EU funds.. 
The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives were aimed at aligning legislation with EU norms and address abuses allegedly committed by magistrates.
Earlier this month, the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters said the changes to the criminal code and procedures were made with ""excessive speed and insufficient transparency"". 
It added they would weaken magistrates' ability ""to fight corruption offences, violent crimes and organized criminality"".

South Sudan plunged into war two years after independence from Sudan in 2011 when a dispute between Kiir and then vice-president Riek Machar erupted into armed confrontation. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the violence, and more than two million have been forced to flee their homes.
On Thursday in Juba, a National Security official who did not give his name told reporters that the release of the prisoners was in line with the peace deal signed in September in the Ethiopian capital. 
However, according to a Reuters witness, the five men who were freed did not appear to be among the senior members of the main rebel faction led by Riek Machar, formerly the vice president of South Sudan. Under the peace deal signed by the government and several rebel factions, senior officials of those factions should be released.
There has been significant confusion recently over the fate of detainees, though the issue has long been a sticking point in successive peace deals that have failed to end the war. 
Some of the men who are still detained by the Juba government have been sentenced to death, including Machar's former spokesman James Gatdek Dak. 
On Oct. 1 the president's spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny, told local broadcaster Radio Tamazuj that all political detainees had been released, under the terms of a separate agreement.

Less than a week later, prisoners at the national security agency's main detentions center, known locally as ""Blue House"", disarmed guards and seized control of part of the center. A detainee told Reuters the inmates taking action were political prisoners seeking freedom.

TBILISI (Reuters) - A former French ambassador is one of two frontrunners to become the next president of Georgia in an election on Sunday, despite critics questioning her patriotism and language skills.
Salome Zurabishvili, 66, was born into a family of Georgian emigres in France and did not visit Georgia until 1986, when she was in her 30s.
She was appointed France's ambassador to the ex-Soviet nation in 2003 but was poached soon afterwards by Georgia's then president Mikheil Saakashvili to become his foreign minister.
The president granted her Georgian citizenship to allow her to take up the post, but sacked her in 2005.
She then set up her own political party, Georgia's Way, which she led until 2010 before temporarily quitting Georgian politics and returning to France.
Elected to Georgia's parliament in 2016 as an independent, Zurabishvili's chances of winning on Sunday are helped by the backing of the ruling Georgian Dream Party, controlled by Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, whose critics say rules it from behind the scenes.
The Georgian presidency has become a largely figurehead post as many of its executive powers have been transferred to the country's prime minister over the last few years.
But the job still carries political influence and its holder helps to shape Georgia's image abroad.
The South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people is Washington's strategic ally in the region and hopes to eventually join the European Union and NATO. Pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to Europe run across its territory.
Zurabishvili's main rival is Grigol Vashadze, 60, running on behalf of a new platform of 11 opposition parties led by ex-president Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM).
Vashadze is also a former foreign minister, a role he held from 2008 until 2012.
Opinion polls put him or Zurabishvili in front of the other 23 contenders.
Zurabishvili has been heavily criticized during the election campaign for saying the country's brief 2008 war with Russia happened because ""we yielded to Russia's provocation"".
""As president, I will never yield to provocations because when you are a small country, you should be cleverer than your enemy,"" she said.

Critics questioned her command of the Georgian language and said the remark was unpatriotic.

The bloc's environment ministers earlier this month agreed a common position that the EU was ready to ""communicate or update"" its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the target reduction of greenhouse gases by each country, by 2020. 
EU lawmakers, in a non-binding resolution, called for concrete targets, recommending countries set an NDC of at least 55 percent by 2030 to help limit the Earth's long-term temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
""It is very important because this is the position of the parliament toward Katowice,"" said Bas Eickhout, a Green lawmaker who shepherded the resolution through the legislature. ""It is a very important signal.""
Raising the NDC would require the approval of all 28 EU nations. 
Earlier this month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the world would have to make ""unprecedented"" changes to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
Meeting this target, rather than the two-degree goal agreed at global climate talks in Paris in 2015, would have ""clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems"", the IPCC said on the release of its report.
The resolution passed in parliament on Thursday also called on the EU to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The vote came two days after the EU's auditor reported the bloc's funding programs for the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) had failed. CCS traps, transports and buries underground carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.
The EU launched two CCS programs in 2009. Only one project was completed, despite 424 million euros ($484 million) in grants.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan has released one of the co-founders of the Afghan Taliban along with another high-ranking militant commander, senior members of the Taliban said on Thursday, with the freed fighters allowed to reunite with their families.
Pakistan declined to comment on the alleged release, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal on Thursday telling reporters that he would ""not like to comment on media reports"".
Security experts in Kabul said the move could be a result of talks launched by the U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban. Earlier this month Khalilzad met Taliban leaders in Qatar in an effort to find a way to end the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan. 
The Taliban's co-founder and former second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was released after high-level negotiations, three senior Taliban members told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mullah Abdul Samad Sani, another senior Taliban commander, was also released. 
A senior official in Afghanistan, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Afghan authorities believe Islamabad this week released Baradar and Sani, along with Mullah Mohammad Rasul, a third Taliban figure. Rasul is the leader of the High Council of Afghanistan Islamic Emirate, a Taliban group in Afghanistan, the Afghan official added. 
Baradar, who coordinated the group's military operations in southern Afghanistan, was arrested in 2010 by a team from Pakistan's military-controlled intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
""Our beloved leaders have joined us back and we are celebrating their freedom,"" said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan's Helmand province.
He said the Taliban leaders were released from jail a week ago but were united with their family on Wednesday. It is not clear what charges the men faced in Pakistan.
""Their old friends, followers, relatives and people of Taliban movement are visiting them and greeting them for their safe release. It’s like a celebration as Mullah Baradar is one of the few leaders who raised the Taliban movement,"" added a second Taliban source.
Taliban sources said the freed Taliban leaders would not be given any responsibility for a long time.
""Mullah Baradar has physically become quite weak and sick and needs proper treatment and long rest,"" said the Taliban leader.
After Baradar regains his health, he said, the top Taliban leaders would decide whether he should be brought into the leadership council.
""Even if they become part of the council, they would have a submissive role and would remain under the strict watch of the Taliban intelligence network, like everyone who is released from jail,"" he said.
Previous media reports about Baradar's release in 2013 proved incorrect.
Baradar was once a close friend of the reclusive former Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, who gave him his nom de guerre, ""Baradar"" or ""brother"".

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's top court ruled on Thursday that a platinum miner that has a deal with a tribal chief could not evict a group of black farmers, in a decision that could curtail the power of traditional leaders whose deals often disadvantage poor blacks.
Land rights are a red-hot issue ahead of elections in 2019 as the African National Congress (ANC) moves for constitutional change aimed at a more equitable distribution of land.
This includes expropriating land from whites without compensation, but also addressing the plight of poor blacks vulnerable to forced evictions in tribal lands because of deals stuck by local chiefs under a property rights system with roots in the colonial and apartheid eras.
At issue in the case before the Constitutional Court was a deal agreed with the council of the Bakgatla tribe to allow Pilanesberg Platinum Mines (PPM), a unit of unlisted Sedibelo Platinum Mines, to evict farmers to expand its open-pit mine.
The farmers argued that they were the rightful owners of the farm and needed to be consulted before mining took place.
In previous court filings, PPM and a partner company formed by the tribal council took the position that the Bakgatla community controls the farm and adjoining properties communally, with the chief as custodian.
The court ruled that such an arrangement ran rough shod over the rights of the applicants, comprised of 13 families whose ancestors bought the farm over a century ago but could not get title deeds to it because of racist laws at the time.
""There is a constitutional imperative ... to ensure that persons or communities whose tenure of land is legally insecure as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices are entitled either to tenure which is legally secure or to comparable redress,"" it said.
After the unanimous judgment was delivered, about 50 people including the farmers facing eviction and their supporters broke out into song and dance in the court.
""We feel vindicated. The chief never listened to us,"" said a jubilant Setshedi Rasepae, one of the supporters.
Through a spokesman, the company said: ""Sedibelo Platinum Mines is studying the judgment and will advise pursuant actions as and when appropriate.""
Lawyers and land policy experts say the implications are far reaching and could raise questions about other mining deals signed between companies and tribal chiefs, which have stoked social strife and conflict. 
""It dramatically undermines the powers of traditional leaders to make deals on behalf of subjects,"" said Johan Lorenzen, a lawyer at human rights firm Richard Spoor Inc Attorneys.
Aninka Claassens, director of the University of Cape Town's Land and Accountability Research Centre, said: ""No mining company can continue to pretend that traditional leaders are authorised to make these deals without the consent of the people directly affected.""
Traditional leaders hold sway in South Africa's old ""Homelands,"" islands of rural poverty where most blacks were literally confined along tribal lines under apartheid.
These areas comprise only 13 percent of South Africa's land but are home to a third of the population, 17 million blacks, mostly subsistence farmers working tiny plots. 
On these lands, the chiefs often determine who gets to farm or where cattle are grazed and also - and more significantly - who gets access to resources like water and minerals.
The chiefs maintain they are the custodians of African culture and tradition and play a role in mediating disputes and dispensing justice among their subjects. Critics allege some have used their powers of resource allocation to enrich themselves.

LUCAPA, Angola (Reuters) - Residents of Kapende, a Congolese neighborhood in the Angolan town of Lucapa, scrawled messages on their homes to keep the looters away, but it did not work. 
""Occupied"", ""do not enter"", ""home of an Angolan"": The writing remains visible on the wrecked houses belonging to Congolese who have gone home as Angola has clamped down on illegal diamond mines and the migrants who worked them. 
The destruction in Kapende, where no house remains occupied or intact, marked the culmination of three days of violence in Lucapa, a sprawling mining town in the northeast surrounded by some of the world's richest diamond fields.
About 300,000 Congolese have fled Angola in the last few weeks, many of them in response to the violence in Lucapa at the beginning of October.
For many in the town, the violence was shocking in an area that had turned a blind eye to Congolese migration and where digging for diamonds provided a living. Politically, the upheaval threatens to further destabilize Congo ahead of elections in December and harm relations with Angola, an old ally.
In interviews with 14 eyewitnesses as well as an Angolan security source, Reuters has pieced together the events of Oct. 3, 4 and 5, detailing for the first time the ethnic violence, police action and looting that forced half the city to flee to the border and into Democratic Republic of Congo.
The accounts of death and pillage contradict assertions by the Angolan government that Congolese migrants are returning home voluntarily and that only one person died, in a traffic accident. Angola denied accusations of massacres and abuses.
It says it is asserting its right to ensure national security and protect its natural resources. Angola says the effort, which it calls Operation Transparency, is part of a drive to reform the diamond sector and increase revenues from the country's second largest export after oil.
Although home to some of the world's most exciting diamond prospects, Angola has long been shunned by major mining companies due to corruption and a lack of transparency. The government has vowed radical change to put its sector on a par with Botswana and South Africa.
    
HUMAN RIGHTS
The United Nations refugee agency says it is concerned by the worsening humanitarian situation as throngs of people arrive in Kasai, a part of DRC where conflict killed up to 5,000 people and displaced 1.5 million in 2016 and 2017. 
DRC summoned Angola's ambassador, demanding a ""comprehensive investigation to establish who is responsible for these wrongful acts"". 
Reuters was unable to establish how many people died in Lucapa, but witnesses said the toll was at least eight. 
An Angolan security source with knowledge of the operation said between 10 and 14 had been killed. Congolese who fled Lucapa and were interviewed by Reuters across the border said the number was higher.  
It remains unclear how many deaths were the result of police fire or of ethnic violence, but at least three people were killed by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
Pedro Sebastiao, Minister of State for Presidential Security and head of Operation Transparency, said: ""They are completely false, the claims of massacres, abuses and violations committed by the authorities or by Angolan people.""

The screams were the first sign something was wrong in the neighborhood of Roque, on Lucapa's west-side, said Corneille Mbala, a 42-year-old mining supervisor. A group of locals from the Tchokwe tribe burst into houses of Congolese migrants on the morning of Oct. 3.  
""They threatened to kill me and my wife,"" Mbala said. ""We fled, leaving everything we possessed behind."" 
He said five of his friends were killed by the mob in Roque that morning, butchered with machetes. Mbala escaped to Santa Isabel, a neighborhood the violence had not yet reached. 
The authorities had been using local Angolans from the Tchokwe community to spy on the town's Congolese, witnesses said. A few informers began looting houses of those that had left. Others joined and a mob formed, threatening occupied homes. 
The Tchokwe people, dominant in this part of Angola, have long resented Lucapa's immigrant Congolese community, many of them from the Pende tribe. They said they resented their arrogance, flashy cars and fancy clothes - bought with money from diamond digging.
Although illegal, Lucapa's diamond trade was not hidden. Buyers known as bosses put their faces on billboards and Land Cruisers as if running for political office. 
""The lion of Lucapa, brother of the artisanal miner,"" ran one slogan. ""Always loyal to the client,"" read another. 
While the bosses built luxury homes, most of Lucapa lived in squalor. Mountains of trash run through town. Poorer neighborhoods are reachable only by motorbike, along narrow muddy paths.
""This was one of the last places in the world you could become a millionaire overnight,"" said Jorge Felix, a 50-year-old Cuban who works on legitimate diamond projects in the area. 
""But none of the money stayed here. There's no water, no electricity, nothing.""  
THE FIGHT BACK
On Oct. 4, the Congolese fought back. Many grabbed machetes to defend themselves from looting. Reports spread that the Pende were arming themselves with bows and venomous arrows, according to local residents. 
About 200 Congolese men marched shouting toward the main police station sometime before midday, two eyewitnesses said. The group clashed with Angolans outside a school, with a young girl slashed in the head with a machete. She later died in hospital, the sources said. Police fired warning shots and dispersed the crowd. Fighting continued to flare up across town. 
An Angolan security source with knowledge of the operation said Lucapa police called the provincial capital Dundo for back-up.
The law enforcement that arrived to restore order were the Rapid Intervention Police (PIR), an elite heavily-armed branch.
On Friday morning, eyewitnesses said members of the PIR and Chacal, Angola's Israeli-trained special forces branch, entered the neighborhoods of Kapende and Santa Isabel. 
In Kapende at least one man was killed by law enforcement, according to eyewitnesses, while in Santa Isabel at least two died at the hands of the authorities. 
Witness testimony suggests four others were injured in the fighting and taken to hospital. Reuters visited the hospital, but doctors declined to say how many people they had treated for conflict wounds, saying local government permission was needed. It was not given.
With their homes looted, the Congolese left in droves. 
Some packed into huge green trucks rented by the government, others paid to be driven in Land Cruisers or rickshaws to the border. Some just walked, sleeping in the open.
When Reuters visited Kapende on Oct. 19, a few lonely figures scavenged for what little was left, cutting out a few bricks from a destroyed church and hammering an axle off a burnt-out car. Everything else had gone. 
At the border, the flow of migrants had slowed but hundreds were still crossing.

""There's nothing for me on the other side, I have no family,"" said Kafundanga Dominque, 30, lugging a rolled-up mattress. Staring towards Congo, he said: ""I'm already dead.""

516,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>","Soros university says it being forced out of Hungary, mulls move","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's Central European University, a graduate school founded by U.S. financier George Soros, said it was being forced out of the country by the nationalist government and would switch to enrolling new students in Vienna if it did not get guarantees of academic freedom by Dec. 1.
A statement by the university said the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban had kept it in legal limbo for more than a year by failing to reach a formal agreement on its status.
""We cannot operate legally in Hungary as a free, U.S. accredited institution. We are being forced out of a country that has been our home for 26 years,"" CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff told a news conference.
The announcement followed months of attacks by the Orban government which has made the demonization of Hungarian-born financier Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, a central part of its right-wing policies.
The government accuses the CEU, which offers graduate-level courses taught in English and is frequently ranked as the top university in Hungary, of operating without full legal compliance.
Orban regularly accuses Soros of plotting to destroy European civilization by flooding the continent with immigrants. Soros says his support for refugees is one part of a wider humanitarian mission to back open societies around the globe.
The Hungarian government’s anti-Soros campaign forced his charitable Open Society Foundations to leave Hungary earlier this year.

The statement by the university said it would enroll new students in U.S. degrees at its Vienna campus in 2019 if its legal status in Hungary was not resolved by Dec. 1, though it would try to maintain as much research and educational activity in Budapest as possible.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A federal prison in northern Mexico owned by BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) has gone into operation, the government said, as the world's largest asset manager expands further into infrastructure investment around the world.
A spokeswoman for prison agency OADPRS said that inmates began to arrive in August at the facility, known as CPS Coahuila, and that there were 139 people there by the end of that month. OADPRS declined to answer further questions.
Security at the prison is the responsibility of the Mexican government, while a BlackRock subsidiary runs operations such as food and maintenance.
The contract to build and maintain the prison was first awarded almost eight years ago to a different company. BlackRock took over the project in 2016, after the Mexican government made changes to the prison and raised the promised annual payments to its operator to pay for them.
BlackRock will receive annual payments of at least 1.281 billion pesos ($65.5 million) a year for 20 years to cover construction, food and other maintenance, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request and a report by congressional auditor ASF.
Neither the government nor BlackRock would confirm the new sum, which was calculated by Reuters.
In recent years, the asset manager has pushed deeper into infrastructure investment, mostly assets like toll roads, wind power and pipelines.
BlackRock said in a statement through a spokeswoman that any returns from the project would go to Mexican clients.
""BlackRock has been working with the government to effectively and efficiently complete the Coahuila facility, which is now operational,"" the statement said.
The penitentiary is the last to open of eight semi-private prisons contracted out by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon to helped reduce chronic overcrowding. His program was criticized by civil society watchdogs.
Mexico's prison population has fallen since a new justice system was introduced in 2016, as fewer crimes merit automatic pre-trial detention. Experts said cases are also falling apart under a higher bar for police conduct and standards of evidence.

OADPRS, which has had six different leaders under President Enrique Pena Nieto, originally gave the CPS Coahuila contract to Mexican construction firm Grupo Tradeco in December 2010.

With the conservatives and SPD facing a second local election drubbing in two weeks, Sunday's vote in the western state of Hesse could help decide how Merkel choreographs the end of her 13-year stewardship of Europe's biggest economy.
SPD members are piling pressure on their own leaders to abandon the 'grand coalition' they reluctantly joined in March and reinvent themselves.
In unusually blunt language at a campaign event in the city of Frankfurt, the general-secretary of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), spelt out what this could mean.
""If this government were to break apart now, it would lead to new elections,"" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who Merkel promoted to the senior party post in February in a clear signal that she is the chancellor's choice to succeed her.
Opinion polls suggest a snap election would probably hurt the conservatives and SPD most. 
Merkel has been weakened by her 2015 decision to let more than a million migrants into Germany and -- while polls show her conservatives are still the biggest party -- their support has fallen to 26-27 percent, meaning a coalition with the SPD might no longer have sufficient support.
The environmentalist Greens, on 16-20 percent have overtaken the SPD in most surveys, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) remain strong with 15-17 percent.
After coming second in an election in the southern state of Bavaria on Oct. 14, the Greens are also set to be kingmakers in Hesse but big losses for the conservatives could spell the end of the conservative-Greens alliance in the state.
Infighting within Merkel's federal coalition, which also includes Bavaria's CSU, has hit the popularity of all three partners since they took office in March. The government came to the brink of collapse in July due to a row over migrant policy.
Kramp-Karrenbauer said the ruling parties must get together after the Hesse election and decide on the government's policy priorities.
""I believe that would be an important signal to people,"" she said.

Merkel is due to make her final campaign speech in Hesse later on Thursday.

Duterte has made a bloody fight against drugs the centerpiece of his administration since he won a presidential election in 2016. Thousands of people have been killed in the crackdown.
Duterte said Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapena was being removed from his post and all his deputies and top officials would be transferred.
""The commissioners are out, the department heads are out,"" Duterte said during a speech at a ceremony commemorating the founding of the coastguard.
He said he was appointing retired army general to take over the bureau and soldiers and members of the coastguard would help him.
Duterte said Lapena would be reassigned to a government training agency.
Lapena, who was at the ceremony, expressed surprise by his transfer and commented briefly to reporters to express his thanks to Duterte for his new posting. He was not available for comment later.
Lapena, a retired police general, has been under pressure since customs authorities failed to detect a shipment estimated at more than a ton of methamphetamines being smuggled into the country in July.
Drug enforcement agents later found traces of the drugs in the containers in which they were smuggled, but the drugs were gone.
Duterte did not refer to that case on Thursday.
The previous head of the customs bureau was removed after a huge amount of drugs were smuggled into the country in May last year.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 08:14AM ET</span>",Bolsonaro's anti-China rants have Beijing nervous about Brazil,"By Jake Spring
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Chinese government is trying to make peace with Brazil's leading presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, whose China-bashing threatens to chill a profitable trading relationship that has benefited both countries.
Chinese diplomats based in Brasilia have met twice with top Bolsonaro advisors in recent weeks, according to participants in the meetings. Their aim is to highlight cooperation with Latin America's largest country, whose grain and minerals have fueled China's rise while lifting millions of Brazilians from poverty in the resulting commodities boom.
Bolsonaro has portrayed China, its largest trading partner, as a predator looking to dominate key sectors of its economy.
With its own economy slowing, China cannot afford to become embroiled in another costly trade war like that which has erupted between Beijing and Washington.
Two-way trade between China and Brazil stood at $75 billion last year, according to Brazilian government statistics. China has invested $124 billion in Brazil since 2003, mostly in the oil, mining and energy sectors. China is eager to bankroll railway, port and other infrastructure projects here to speed the movement of its Brazilian grain. 
But the far-right Bolsonaro, much like U.S. President Donald Trump, has criticized China repeatedly on the campaign trail, saying the Chinese should not be allowed to own Brazilian land or control key industries. An ardent nationalist, Bolsonaro is expected to win a landslide victory in balloting this Sunday.
""The Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil,"" Bolsonaro has warned repeatedly.
Companies in the crosshairs include China Molybdenum Co Ltd, which bought a $1.7 billion niobium mine in 2016 that Bolsonaro says Brazil should develop itself.
Niobium is used as an additive to steel to make it stronger and lighter. It is used in cars, buildings, jet engines and a host of other applications. Brazil controls about 85 percent of the world's supply and Bolsonaro wants his nation to reap the benefits.
Bolsonaro is also on record opposing a planned privatization of some assets of state-owned utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (Eletrobras) on concerns that Chinese buyers would win the bid.
Officials at China Molybdenum declined requests for comment. But six senior executives at Chinese companies operating in Brazil told Reuters they were watching Bolsonaro's remarks with varying degrees of concern.
""We are worrying a bit about some of his extreme views,"" one Chinese infrastructure executive told Reuters. ""He is on guard against China.""
Bolsonaro's friendly leanings toward Taiwan are likewise vexing to Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province. Bolsonaro in February became the first Brazilian presidential candidate to visit Taiwan since Brazil recognized Beijing as the sole Chinese government under the One China policy in the 1970s.
The Chinese embassy in Brazil issued a letter condemning Bolsonaro's Taiwan trip as an ""affront to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.""
Bolsonaro's combative stance is in stark contrast to the rest of Latin America, whose leaders have welcomed Chinese investment, loans and commodities purchases.
And it could eventually put him at odds with Brazil's powerful farm and mining industries, for whom China is an indispensable customer.
Shares of Brazilian miner Vale SA, for example, the world's largest iron ore producer, hit an all-time high last month on strong Chinese demand for its high-quality ore.
Brazil's farm sector, meanwhile, has reaped the benefit of China's feud with Trump. Beijing has sharply reduced purchases of American soybeans, filling the gap with Brazilian grain. Brazilian exports of soy to China are up 22 percent by value this year with about 80 percent of its soy shipments now destined there.
The U.S.-China trade war has given Brazil leverage for now. But Jorge Arbache, former secretary for international affairs at Brazil's planning ministry, said Brazil would do well not to overplay its hand.
Brazil ""does not have the luxury of giving up its biggest trade and investment partner,"" Arbache said. ""There's not one economy in the world that can occupy the space China occupies.""
PRIVATE MEETINGS
Chinese diplomats met with Bolsonaro's top economic advisor Paulo Guedes in early September to discuss the importance of the bilateral relationship, Qu Yuhui, Chinese Minister-Counselor at the embassy in Brasilia, told Reuters on Monday.
The Chinese team portrayed their nation as a partner that does not compete with Brazil economically, according to Qu, who attended the meeting, and one other person familiar with the matter.
Guedes was offered a trip to China to strengthen his knowledge of the world's second-largest economy, Qu said. He said Chinese diplomats made it clear they would like to meet Bolsonaro in person, although no meeting has been set. 
""Regardless of right- or left-wing, we want to talk and advance the smooth development of China-Brazil relations, which we believe benefits both countries,"" Qu said. ""We have confidence that whoever is Brazil's president will improve China-Brazil relations."" 
Guedes did not respond to requests for comment. 
Last week Reuters spotted Qu and another Chinese diplomat entering the offices of Congressman Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro's campaign manager, proposed chief of staff and the organizer of the candidate's Taiwan trip.
Qu declined to comment on the matter.
Lorenzoni said he met with two Chinese diplomats and that there would be further talks after the election. He said China is a vital partner and the two countries would maintain good relations.
If elected, Bolsonaro's first major meeting with the Chinese would come early in his presidency. Brazil hosts the BRICS summit in 2019, an event that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to attend.

'BUYING BRAZIL'
Bolsonaro is content with China purchasing commodities. But the former Army captain is wary of the Asian nation's recent shopping spree in Brazil's energy and infrastructure sectors.
China Three Gorges Corp paid 4.8 billion reais ($1.48 billion) in 2016 to operate two of Brazil's largest dams. Last year, State Grid Corp of China bought a controlling stake in Sao Paulo's CPFL Energia SA and a subsidiary for 17.36 billion reais ($4.90 billion), while China's HNA Airport Holding Group Co Ltd bought a controlling stake in Brazil's second-busiest airport. 
Brazil is now expected to put a number of government concessions and assets up for bid next year, including railways and state-held energy assets.
The outgoing administration of Brazilian President Michel Temer has attempted to privatize state-controlled energy company Eletrobras, a move which requires congressional approval.
Bolsonaro has said he is against selling Eletrobras generation assets because it would ""leave Brazil in Chinese hands.""
The Chinese infrastructure executive said his company was worried that Bolsonaro might change the government auction rules to disadvantage Chinese bidders. He and other Chinese executives who spoke to Reuters declined to be identified.
To date, Bolsonaro has been vague about how he would carry out actions to stop Chinese investment he sees as undesirable. Brazil has no equivalent of the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investment in American companies.
Bolsonaro also needs to tread carefully with the huge agribusiness caucus that controls more than 40 percent of seats in Brazil's Congress.
The nation's farmers are overwhelmingly supportive of Bolsonaro, but have made clear that maintaining good relations with China, their largest export customer, is paramount.

""The economy is much more important than propaganda to get votes,"" said an executive at an agricultural company who declined to be identified. ""You can't change it that easily without severe repercussions.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A 44-year-old Japanese freelance journalist returned home on Thursday to rice balls cooked by his mother but an uncertain future more than three years after militants in Syria captured him in what he described as a physical and mental ""hell"".
Jumpei Yasuda, who quit his job as a reporter on a Japanese newspaper to cover the Iraq war in 2003, arrived in Tokyo from Turkey, rekindling debate in Japan about reporting from war zones that some see as reckless adventurism and others as courageous journalism.
Television footage showed a gaunt-looking Yasuda walking down stairs to a waiting car at Narita airport for a short ride to another airport building.
To reporters' calls of ""Welcome home"" he simply nodded with a strained smile as he disappeared down a corridor to where his family waited.
Later, his wife, a singer known as Myu, bowed deeply and apologized to a packed news conference at which Yasuda did not appear.
""He would like to apologize for causing a fuss and making people worry about him, but fortunately he was able to safely return to Japan,"" she said, sniffing back tears.
""He feels he has a responsibility to explain things to you as much as possible,"" she added, but said this would have to wait until he had undergone medical checks.
Yasuda gave few details of his captivity but told his parents, who were also there, that he had worried they might not be alive, Myu said, adding that he ate some rice balls his mother had made for him ""very happily"".
""He also said he wants to take a hot bath and then sleep in a futon.""
SYRIAN CAPTURE NOT FIRST TIME
Yasuda traveled to Iraq in late 2002 using paid leave from his regional newspaper job but was frustrated when they refused to send him on assignment there and quit in 2003. In 2004, on another trip to Iraq, he was captured near Baghdad by militants, who held him for three days. 
In a book he published the same year, he explained he had undertaken the assignment because he wanted to show the suffering caused by the war.
""I could not see faces of people living in the country which was called part of an 'axis of evil' from any information provided by Japanese media, which only reported diplomatic matters and inspections by the United Nations,"" he wrote.
Yasuda returned to Iraq in 2007 to work as a cook at an Iraqi army training camp and in 2010 published a book in Japan about war zone laborers.
His last trip to the region was in 2015. Apart from a few brief videos released by his captors, little is known about what happened to him after he disappeared. Other Japanese captured there have been killed. 
In 2015 veteran Japanese war correspondent Kenji Goto and a friend he had tried to free, Haruna Yukawa, were beheaded by Islamic State militants. Both were lambasted in Japan for their decision to travel to Iraq. 
Earlier, in 2004, a Japanese high school graduate, an aid worker and a freelance photographer taken hostage in Iraq were also condemned as irresponsible after their release. Japan is careful to stay out of disputes in the Middle East and tries to maintain friendly ties with countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia that are at loggerheads. 
""There was bashing before and it appears it is already happening this time,"" freelance journalist Kosuke Tsuneoka, a friend of Yasuda, told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""Yasuda is tough and has great mental strength. I'm not worried he will be hurt.""
As Yasuda flew to Japan, some on social media were already condemning him.
""After he returns, I want him to hold a news conference to apologize and work to pay back the ransom. I don't need to hear his opinion,"" tweeted a person with the twitter handle ""kawako"".
The Japanese government has denied paying a ransom for Yasuda's release.
Yasuda's wife said he must be allowed time to recover, and Yasuda himself - apparently struggling to speak Japanese - told Reuters en route to Istanbul his future was uncertain.

""I am happy that I can return to Japan. At the same time, I don’t know what will happen from here or what I should do,” he said.

Kong Linlin, a 48-year-old reporter for the country's state-run broadcaster China Central Television, was arrested after the incident at the event that featured pro-democracy supporters from the former British colony. 
West Midlands Police said she had been charged with common assault and will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Nov. 7.
China Central Television, also known as CCTV, is Beijing’s largest TV network, with dozens of channels and ambitious plans to expand internationally.
Kong did not respond to a request for comment left at her company's offices in London. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed elsewhere in China.
But calls for outright independence are a red line for China's Communist Party leaders, who deem the global financial hub to be an inalienable part of the nation.
A spokesman for the Chinese government had previously described the reporter's treatment as ""completely unacceptable"" and said she herself was assaulted for asking questions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is due to execute two convicted drug traffickers on Friday after hanging a man on Wednesday for the same offense amid fresh calls for the wealthy state to abolish the death penalty.
Human rights group Amnesty International called on Singapore to follow the example of neighboring Malaysia and end capital punishment. 
""Singaporean authorities must halt the imminent executions of Prabu N. Pathmanathan, a 31-year-old Malaysian national, and of another man whose name has not been released,"" Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday.
""News of these planned executions follow the reported execution of another man today, and that of three men, on 5 October, also for drug-related offences."" 
Pathmanathan was convicted of smuggling drugs from Malaysia into Singapore in 2014, according to court documents.
Malaysia's newly elected cabinet, which took power in May, said this month it would abolish the death penalty by the end of the year.
""I will issue a letter to the Singapore government to urge them to give Prabu a chance,"" Malaysian Law Minister Liew Vui Keong told reporters on Wednesday.
Singapore has some of the toughest anti-drugs laws in the world, and its customs forms warn arriving travelers of “death for drug traffickers"" in no uncertain terms.
Amnesty International says that 15 countries have laws for the death penalty for drug-related offences. 
""But Amnesty International recorded executions for drug-related offences in only four - China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Singapore,"" it said. 
Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs, which run both the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau and the Singapore Prison Service, could not be immediately reached for comment.
A candlelight vigil, expected to be attended by anti-death penalty activists, will take place later in the day.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>",Hands off Brazil's niobium: Bolsonaro sees China as threat to utopian vision,"By Jake Spring
CATALÃO, Brazil (Reuters) - Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate favored to win Brazil's presidential election this Sunday, has a vision for his nation's economy: niobium.
This mineral is used as an additive to steel to make the metal stronger and lighter. Niobium is in high demand by automakers, aerospace companies and a host of other industries. 
Brazil accounts for about 85 percent of the world's supply. And Bolsonaro wants to keep it that way.
China's purchase two years ago of a small Brazilian niobium mine has the candidate agitating to block other foreign purchases of assets deemed strategic.
So smitten is Bolsonaro with niobium - and Brazil's potential to capitalize on its production - that he produced a 20-minute YouTube video touting its virtues.
Shot in a Brazilian niobium mine in 2016, when the longtime congressman was already making plans to run for president, the work lays out Bolsonaro's utopian economic vision for his nation, fueled by the obscure mineral.
""The world talks a lot about Silicon Valley, right?"" Bolsonaro says in the video. ""I dream, who knows, that one day, we'll also have a Niobium Valley."" 
(For a look at Bolsonaro's niobium video, see: https://youtu.be/bMR6ZxP2T0M) 
Mark Zuckerberg probably isn't losing sleep just yet. But the video offers a valuable window into Bolsonaro's perspective on how nations grow rich.
Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship sought to protect strategic natural resources such as oil and minerals from foreign interests, favoring state companies to develop them instead. 
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain and ardent admirer of the military regime, has long subscribed to that view. He has recently embraced free-market economics in his run at the presidency. But the video underscores how difficult resource nationalism may be for him to shake.
Shot in southeastern Brazil in a mine owned by Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração, a privately-held Brazilian company known as CBMM, Bolsonaro marveled at the riches derived from the mineral deposits.
He likewise praised the good-paying jobs, private pre-school and other amenities CBMM provides its workers as substitutes for government handouts.
If the country embraced CBMM's style of development and focused on creating ""future applications"" of the mineral, rather than just exporting it, Bolsonaro reasoned in his YouTube discourse, then Brazil would be in the driver's seat.
Thus he was outraged when that same year China Molybdenum Co Ltd (CMOC) bought a niobium mine just 125 miles away from the CBMM facility.
What is more, Brazil's CBMM itself is 15 percent owned by a consortium of five Chinese companies: Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd (Baosteel); CITIC Group; Anshan Iron & Steel Group Corp; Shougang Corp; and Taiyuan Iron & Steel Group Co Ltd.
Bolsonaro is believed to be the first presidential candidate to make niobium a campaign issue. In a nationally televised interview in August, he criticized the CMOC purchase.
""It's something only we have, we should invest in technology and research to use this mineral,"" Bolsonaro said. ""Instead we sell and deliver the mine to them.""
UTOPIA MEETS REALITY
Mining experts say Bolsonaro's niobium fears are overblown.
For starters, Brazil's deposits are not under siege. CMOC's Brazil mine accounts for just 10 percent of the global market, according to Hugo Nadler, an executive in Brazil who left the company earlier this year.
That leaves the lion's share - about 75 percent - firmly in the hands of Brazil's CBMM. The company is the only player to sell in all niobium market segments, the company told Reuters in a statement, including high value-added products used in airplanes and superconductors.
And while Chinese firms own roughly one-sixth of the company, its technology is not shared with minority shareholders, CBMM said.
CBMM said there is lots of potential for expanding the use of niobium in applications such as car batteries and electroceramics.
But even if the niobium market grows, it is unlikely to have much impact on an economy the size of Brazil's, said Nadler, the former CMOC executive.
""Mining makes up 5 percent of GDP, if you take the portion that is niobium, it's nothing,"" he said.
Bolsonaro remains a believer.
Holding a chunk of niobium in his right hand and pointing it toward the camera in his video, he declared: ""This can give us economic independence.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party challenged Prime Minister Theresa May's government on Thursday to deliver immediately on its promise that nearly a decade of public spending cuts is coming to an end.
Finance minister Philip Hammond will announce his annual budget next week, armed with better than expected public finances but needing to balance any largesse with caution over the huge uncertainty posed by Brexit.
Labour's finance policy chief John McDonnell said Hammond must also flesh out a promise May has made to bring an end to austerity after eight years of public spending cuts designed to shrink Britain's budget deficit.
""This budget will show us whether she is true to her word or not,"" McDonnell said. ""We need decisive action to end and reverse austerity, not some vague promises for the future and a few financial conjuring tricks.""
Responding to McDonnell's speech, Treasury minister Liz Truss defended her party's track record on the economy and said the government was working to grow the economy so more money was available for public services. 
May told her party's annual conference this month that ""a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.""
Britain's budget deficit has been cut from nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2009/10 to under 2 percent in the last financial year.
McDonnell's speech was accompanied by a dossier outlining Labour research into the extent and impact of spending cuts on areas such as health, education and local services. It said 30 billion pounds of new funding was needed to stop planned cuts, and nearly 80 billion to reverse cuts since 2010.

""What we've done in the dossier is to try and get Theresa May and Philip Hammond to focus on the impact of austerity,"" he said. ""We will seek to ensure not just that we end austerity, but actually reverse much of what's been done.""

More than 300,000 euros in cash, weapons and high-end cars were also confiscated after raiding more than 20 homes and business in relation to the bust, the police said.
A police statement said the suspects were smuggling drugs from Latin America via a company dedicated to importing large quantities of bananas and other fruit from Costa Rica, according to a statement.
The investigation into the drugs ring lasted for almost a year and also involved Portuguese and U.S. officials, it said.
In April, Spanish police made a record seizure of nearly nine tons of cocaine in a shipping container that was also carrying bananas in the southern port of Algeciras.

The plea was made by Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, the Chairman and Chief Executive of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) appointed by Libya's internationally recognized government, to Britain's Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt.
""There is no lawful basis for the United Kingdom to seize or change ownership of the frozen LIA assets. These belong to the Libyan people,"" Mohamed said in a letter sent to Burt on Wednesday, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters.
""The UN Security Council has likewise ruled that frozen assets, when released, must be used for the benefit of the Libyan people.""
Those behind a British parliamentary bill argue that the regime of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi supplied arms to the IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland which saw over 3,600 people killed and thousands more injured.
The LIA estimates some 9.5 billion pounds' ($12.25 billion) worth of its assets are in the United Kingdom.
Control over the LIA has long been contested by rival Libyan factions based in Tripoli and eastern Libya, and the fund was forced to move out of its offices in Libya's capital earlier this year because of militia pressure.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's military will take action ""at any cost"" to foil any attempt to separate the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, the country's defense minister said on Thursday.
China has been infuriated by recent U.S. sanctions on its military, one of a growing number of flashpoints in Sino-U.S. ties that include a bitter trade war, the issue of Taiwan, and China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.
On Monday, the United States sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait in the second such operation this year and the latest in a series of U.S. gestures in support of democratic Taiwan.
""The Taiwan issue is related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and touches upon China's core interests,"" Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe said at the opening of the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing, which China styles as its answer to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.
""On this issue, it is extremely dangerous to repeatedly challenge China's bottom line. If someone tries to separate out Taiwan, China's military will take the necessary actions at any cost.""
Taiwan's Presidential Office and Defence Ministry declined to comment on Wei's remarks. Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.
China-Taiwan relations have deteriorated since the island's President Tsai Ing-wen, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, swept to power in 2016. 
Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will not be bullied.
Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has also viewed U.S. overtures toward the island with alarm, such as a new de facto embassy there and passage of a law to encourage visits by U.S. officials.
China's military ties with the United States are important and sensitive, Wei said, adding that China would never give up an inch of its territory.
Beijing opposed displays of strength and provocation in the South China Sea by ""nations from outside the region"" carried out under the pretence of protecting freedom of flight and navigation, he added.
The world's two largest economies needed to deepen high-level ties so as to navigate tension and rein in the risk of inadvertent conflict, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told his Chinese counterpart in Singapore last week.
Mattis saw firsthand last month how mounting Sino-U.S. friction can undermine military contacts, when Beijing upended plans for him to meet Wei in October in Beijing at a security dialogue.
However, speaking at a monthly briefing, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian described the Wei-Mattis talks as positive and constructive, adding that Mattis had again invited Wei to visit the United States.
China has been angered too by U.S. sanctions on its military for buying weapons from Russia.
China has also expressed concern after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States would withdraw from a Cold War-era treaty that eliminated nuclear missiles from Europe because Russia was violating the pact.

China is not a party to that treaty, but Trump has also suggested China's military strength played a role in his decision, which China has described as ""completely wrong"".

Conservative caucuses ranging from evangelicals to farmers and pro-gun lawmakers have visited the front-runner at his home this week to make sure their agendas are on the front-burner if as expected he becomes president-elect on Sunday.
Industry leaders told Bolsonaro they opposed the combining of the ministries of finance and planning with the industry and trade portfolio into a super ministry that would be headed by his economic policy guru Paulo Guedes.
""If this is their interest, for the good of the country, we will maintain the trade and industry ministry, no problem"" Bolsonaro said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live appearance on Wednesday night.
The former Army captain is running on an anti-corruption platform vowing to end the political horse trading of Brazilian politics. He had planned to cut the number of ministries from 29 to 15 to reduce graft and patronage.
Bolsonaro wants to put the culture and sports portfolios under the ministry of education. 
But his most controversial plan to merge the ministries of agriculture and the environment set off a storm of criticism from environmentalists who say it would undermine Brazil's commitment to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
Even Brazilian farmers, staunch fans of Bolsonaro's vow to relax environmental rules and limit indigenous reservations, are thinking twice about the merger because it could hurt their exports by angering environmentally aware consumers abroad.
""There has been some friction over whether the environment ministry should be merged with the agriculture ministry. For my part, I am ready to negotiate,"" Bolsonaro said.
Another Bolsonaro promise to the farm lobby, the easing of gun control laws to allow them to arm themselves against rising crime in rural areas, could actually happen before he takes office on Jan. 1 if he defeats left-wing Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad as expected.
The Speaker of Brazil's lower chamber of Congress, Rodrigo Maia who aims to stay in the job, said on Wednesday he intends to move ahead with the issue after Sunday's vote.

Proposals in Congress would change Brazil's 2003 disarmament statute, which banned all but the security forces from carrying weapons, and make it easier for Brazilian to buy guns and possess weapons in their homes and farms.

The two countries would meet in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu next month to discuss the arrangements, he added, without giving other details.
India and China fought a war in 1962 and the unresolved dispute over stretches of their 3,500 km (2,200 miles) border has clouded relations ever since.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A North Korean general got a warm welcome in Beijing on Thursday, a rare high-profile showing at an international military forum by his normally reclusive country, underscoring an improvement in ties with China and the world.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump held a landmark summit in Singapore in June as they both look to set aside decades of hostility and bring peace to the Korean peninsula.
The two Koreas have also held three summits this year, while Kim has also met Chinese President Xi Jinping three times in 2018.
Attending the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing, which China styles as its answer to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Kim Hyong Ryong, vice minister of North Korea's People's Armed Forces, was greeted warmly by other attendees, including Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.
Addressing the forum, Kim said peace was the priority. 
""Until only a year ago, the danger of military conflict lingered on the Korean Peninsula but today we are witnessing a series of events beyond all our expectations giving rise to the warm atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and peace,"" he said, in comments translated into English.
""Today's dramatic reality of the Korean Peninsula is the fruition of chairman Kim Jong Un's determination and bold decision to turn the Korean Peninsula into a cradle of peace without any nuclear weapons or nuclear threats and achieve national reunification,"" Kim said.
Chinese state media said it was the first time a North Korean general had attended the forum, which senior Western officials are traditionally largely absent from.
Kim said North Korea was making ""sincere efforts"" to successfully implement agreements reached by leader Kim and Trump in Singapore. 
That summit was an ""event of epochal significance"" putting an end to their hostility and opening up a new chapter in ties, he said. 
North Korea wants to turn the peninsula into a ""cradle for peace and prosperity that contributes to the security of Asia and the globe by thoroughly implementing the DPRK-US joint statement"", Kim added, referring to his country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
""The important reason the DPRK put forward a new strategic policy line of concentrating all efforts on socialist economic construction is to contribute to peace and stability of the region and the whole world,"" he said.
""The DPRK will continue to fulfil its obligations and role in order to ease tensions and achieve stable peace on the Korean Peninsula.""

Sahle-Work is at present U.N. under-secretary general and special representative of the secretary general to the African Union. She replaces Mulatu Teshome Wirtu, who tendered his resignation to parliament earlier on Wednesday.
The president's post is a ceremonial one in Ethiopia. The prime minister, who is the head of state, holds executive power. 
""In a historic move, the two Houses has elected Ambassador Shalework Zewde as the next President of #Ethiopia. She is the first female head of state in modern Ethiopia,"" Fitsum Arega, Abiy's chief of staff, said on Twitter.
""In a patriarchal society such as ours, the appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future but also normalizes women as decision-makers in public life.""
Last week, when the prime minister reshuffled his cabinet, he appointed 10 female ministers, making Ethiopia the third country in Africa, after Rwanda and Seychelles, to achieve gender parity in their cabinets.
""When there is no peace in country, mothers will be frustrated. Therefore, we need to work on peace for the sake of our mothers,"" Sahle-Work told parliament after her approval.
Teshome, who had held the office for five years, departed one year ahead of his term ending, saying he wanted to be part of change and reforms.
Sahle-Work becomes the fourth president since the ruling EPRDF coalition came to power.

Since his appointment in April, Abiy has presided over a raft of reforms that have turned the region's politics on its head, including the pardoning of dissidents long outlawed by the government.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Western nations, including the United States and European countries, have expressed ""serious concerns"" to Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan about a crackdown on aid groups, diplomats said.
Pakistan has long viewed foreign-funded aid groups with suspicion and many members of the powerful military believe that Western countries often use such groups as a cover for spying.
Diplomats and foreign journalists also face severe restrictions on their movements in the nuclear-armed nation.
At least 18 international aid agencies, most of them working on human rights issues, were ordered to leave Pakistan over recent months after being refused registration. 
The countries have written a letter to Khan saying the groups did not get a proper explanation for why the government had ordered them out and they criticized a ""lack of transparency"" in the registration process.
""We are writing to express serious concerns with respect to recent developments,"" the countries said in the letter seen by Reuters. Four diplomats confirmed its authenticity.
""Restriction on civil society risks affecting Pakistan's international reputation as a genuine partner on human developments and undermining confidence of the international donor and business community,"" they said in the letter.
Neither Khan's office nor the foreign ministry had any immediate comment on the letter, which was signed by envoys from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway and Switzerland. 
The European Union ambassador signed on behalf of the 17 EU countries with missions in Pakistan, including Britain and France. 
A similar letter was sent to the Interior Ministry in September, diplomatic sources say.
The 18 aid organizations were appealing against their expulsion orders, issued late last year to 27 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in all.
The Western envoys said the impact of expelling the groups would be ""significant"", and warned that it would imperil some of development goals championed by Khan, who was elected in July on a populist platform to help the poor.
""Restricting INGO operations will affect millions of poor Pakistanis. In 2017 alone, the INGO sector reached 34 million people with humanitarian relief and development assistance,"" the counties aid in their letter, referring to international NGOs.
""This will mean thousands of Pakistanis employed by INGOs and local partners may lose their jobs.""
One of the 18 groups facing closure, ActionAid, which focuses on education, poverty alleviation and human rights, said this month the expulsion of the groups was part of a broader pattern.
""Pakistan's decision to shut down ActionAid and other International NGOs is a worrying escalation of recent attacks on civil society, academics and journalists,"" the group said.
Media groups have warned of a more difficult environment for them with increasing censorship and threats from the military, which denies intimidation.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has lost an appeal against an earlier decision to send him to trial over charges of illegal campaign financing, and his lawyer said he would challenge the decision in France's highest appeals court.
If Sarkozy stands trial, he would be the second French president in the dock since Jacques Chirac, who was president from 1995 to 2007. Chirac was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of misusing public funds.
The so-called ""Bygmalion"" campaign financing affair centers on accusations that Sarkozy's party, then known as the UMP, connived with a friendly public relations firm to hide the true cost of his 2012 presidential election campaign. 
France sets limits on campaign spending, and prosecutors allege that the firm Bygmalion invoiced Sarkozy's party rather than the campaign, allowing the UMP to spend almost double the amount permitted.
After five years in power, Sarkozy was defeated by Socialist Francois Hollande when he ran for a second term in 2012. He has since faced a series of investigations into alleged corruption, fraud, favoritism and campaign-funding irregularities.
Sarkozy has denied charges of wrongdoing and has vowed to have all cases dismissed. His lawyer said he would challenge the latest decision in France's supreme Court of Appeal.
Under French law, a suspect is not formally charged with a crime unless he is sent to trial.
On Oct. 8, Sarkozy lost a first appeal against facing trial over separate influence peddling and corruption charges.
In that case, Sarkozy is suspected of helping a prosecutor get promoted in return for leaked information about a separate criminal inquiry. 

Sarkozy lost presidential immunity from legal prosecution a month after he left office.

""Thank you for donning our national colors.""
Dancers in woven skirts and necklaces crafted from red flowers and feathers in their hair sang and clapped to welcome the royal couple to the Polynesian kingdom, made up of 170 mostly uninhabited islands. 
Red-and-white balloons and streamers dotted the route of their motorcade into Nuku'alofa, the capital, while schoolchildren in red and white uniforms waved small plastic British and Tongan flags and cheered excitedly. 
Tonga is the only sovereign constitutional monarchy in Oceania that retains its own royal family, while the region's other constitutional monarchies, like Australia and New Zealand, recognize Britain's Queen Elizabeth as their head of state.
The couple dine with Tupou before an audience on Friday with Prime Minister ‘Akilisi Pōhiva, who briefly found himself at the center of a diplomatic storm in August, when he called for China to forgive mounting debt in the region.
Tonga is one of seven island nations in the South Pacific indebted to China, which is building influence in the region.
The visit by the British royal couple, who announced last week that they are expecting a child, follows a tour of Fiji and Australia, where they will return for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in Sydney, before wrapping up in New Zealand.

Turkey's purchase of the S-400 systems, which are not compatible with NATO defenses, has unnerved the United States and NATO member countries, which are already wary of Russia's presence in the Middle East.
Akar told Anadolu that selected personnel would be sent to Russia to receive training and return to work in Turkey, according to Hurriyet. It was not clear where he was speaking. 
The United States has warned Turkey that going through with the purchase of S-400s could result in Washington imposing sanctions and halting other existing procurements, but Ankara has pressed on with the deal.
Turkey has said that its Western allies, namely the United States, have failed to cooperate with it in its efforts to boost its defense capabilities, and that Ankara has had to look outside of the NATO to meet its needs.
While pursuing S-400 project, President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey's ties with NATO remain strong, and Ankara has sought to secure defense deals with other countries as well.
Last year, Turkey signed a letter of intent with France and Italy to strengthen cooperation on joint defense projects. As a first step, the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium and Turkish companies will look into a system based on the SAMP-T missile systems.
Turkey is also buying  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets from the United States, but United States has warned that their purchase could be jeopardized if it does not drop the S-400 purchase plan.
""There were some issues stemming from the S-400s, political and judicial developments, but the political and military conditions we have now do not cause concerns,"" Akar told Anadolu. 
Akar said the F-35 program was continuing as planned, with the third and fourth jets to be delivered in March next year.
Erdogan has previously said that Turkey would continue to pay its installments to procure the jets, but that it would look elsewhere if Washington decided to halt the delivery.

Turkey and the United States have also held talks on the possible sale of a Raytheon Co Patriot missile defense systems as an alternative to the S-400 systems.

Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, appeared on Wednesday in the Federal Court of Appeal in the capital Abu Dhabi. 
He was arrested on May 5 at Dubai airport after a two-week research visit and formally charged last week with spying on the Gulf state, where he is being held in solitary confinement.
The court agreed to the review after the defense lawyer, assigned to the case on Oct. 10, argued that the evidence retrieved from Hedges' devices contained only publicly available information, his wife, Daniela Tejada, said in a statement.
The session was closed to the public because it concerned national security and court officials could not be reached immediately for comment.
The British Foreign Office did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but British authorities have said they raised Hedges' case with the UAE several times.
The UAE's attorney general has said Hedges was charged with spying for a foreign state, without naming it, and jeopardizing the military, economic and political security of the country.
""The UAE invests considerable time and money painting itself as a progressive and tolerant country, but Hedges' case shows the face of an autocratic government with a fundamental lack of respect for the rule of law,"" Human Rights Watch deputy Middle East director, Michael Page, said in a statement this week. 
More than 120 academics from around the world issued a petition last week urging the UAE authorities to release him.
According to Durham University's website, Hedges is a doctoral student in the School of Government and International Affairs whose research interests include civil-military relations, political economy and tribalism.
Last year, he co-authored an article in an academic journal on the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member.
The UAE is a tourism and trade hub for the Middle East, but tolerates little public criticism of its monarchy or policies and has been waging a war against the Islamist ideology of the Brotherhood.

OSLO (Reuters) - Military forces from 31 countries began NATO's largest exercise in decades, stretching from the Baltic Sea to Iceland, on Thursday, practicing military maneuvers close to Russia, which itself held a huge military drill last month.
As temperatures fell below freezing across training grounds in central Norway, giving a taste of what it means to defend NATO's vast northern flank, some 50,000 troops, 250 aircraft and 10,000 tanks, trucks and other land-based vehicles were ready.
""Forces are in position, they are integrating and starting combat enhancement training for major battlefield operations over the next two weeks,"" Colonel Eystein Kvarving at Norway's Joint Headquarters told Reuters.
Dubbed Trident Juncture, the exercise is by far the biggest in Norway since the early 1980s, a sign that the alliance wants to sharpen its defenses after years of cost cuts and far-flung combat missions.
Increasingly concerned about Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014, Norway has sought to double the number of U.S. Marines receiving training on its soil every year, a move criticized by Moscow. 
Russia last month held its biggest maneuvers since 1981, called Vostok-2018 (East-2018), mobilizing 300,000 troops in a show of force close to China's border which included joint drills with the Chinese and Mongolian armies.
NATO's war games were originally meant to involve 35,000 troops, but the number grew in recent months and included the late addition of an aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman with some 6,000 personnel.
NATO fears Russia's military build-up in the region could ultimately restrict naval forces' ability to navigate freely, and on Oct. 19 the Truman became the first American aircraft carrier to enter the Arctic Circle since before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Although a solid majority of Norwegians support membership of NATO, whose secretary general is former Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, some parties on the left would prefer that the country quit the alliance and form some type of military cooperation arrangement with its Nordic neighbors.
""The effect of this activity will increase the tension between Norway and Russia,"" Socialist member of parliament Torgeir Knag Fylkesnes said of the exercise, adding that the presence of an aircraft carrier caused particular concern.
""You have to be quite hawkish to view this as something that brings peace in any way,"" he told Reuters.

The stench of burning plastic and fumes from nearly a dozen recycling factories wafts through the neighborhood, even as more container-loads of plastic waste are unloaded. 
Pulau Indah - ironically, the name means ""beautiful island"" in Malay - is one of many towns in Malaysia where illegal plastic recycling factories have popped up in recent months as the Southeast Asian nation became the top choice for plastic waste exporters from around the world. 
The trigger for this dumping deluge was a Chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year, which disrupted the flow of more than 7 million tonnes of plastic scrap a year. 
Malaysia quickly became the leading alternative destination, importing nearly half a million tonnes of plastic waste between January and July from just its top 10 source-countries.
Dozens of factories have opened up in Malaysia to handle that waste, many without an operating license, using low-end technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal. 
""The situation is getting worse, especially with more and more illegal plastic recycling factories,"" Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia's minister of energy, technology, science, climate change and environment, told parliament last week. 
Used plastic is recycled into pellets, which are then used to manufacture other plastic products, but the process comes with pollution risks. Plastic unsuitable for recycling is burnt, which releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. Or it ends up in landfill, potentially contaminating soil and water sources.
Yeo said she does not want Malaysia to be the ""trash can"" for developed nations, but Housing Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin, who oversees the waste management department, told Reuters that the government also does not want to miss out on a business that could be worth billions.
Both ministers are members of a government committee studying its options for dealing with the growing pile of plastic waste.
BURNING PLASTIC
In the Pulau Indah industrial zone, Reuters reporters saw nearly a dozen recycling plants, many of them without signboards or company names, though government data shows only two factories in that area have a license to import plastic waste.
One of the bigger ones, Jingye Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, was shut down in August for not having a license, according to an official notice seen by Reuters.
But workers in the factory and others nearby say it reopened within weeks, and when Reuters reporters visited earlier this month, it was operating. Plastic waste was stacked up within the premises and all along the road. 
The factory supervisor declined to comment.
Company records show Jingye was set up in Malaysia in October 2017, three months after China said it would ban imports of foreign waste from 2018. Reuters could not reach the owners of the factory and no contact details were listed in records.
One worker in the industrial zone, who did not want to be identified, said there were as many as eight illegal factories in the zone and many openly burned plastic that cannot be recycled. 
""Every night they burn. I see black smoke at night, so I go over and ask him 'why are you trying to kill me?' They ignore me,"" he said.
In the nearby district of Kuala Langat, authorities found 41 factories operating illegally, many of them run by Chinese companies, according to Housing Minister Zuraida. Around 30 were shut down by authorities in the last three months after residents complained of open burning of plastic and health complications.

STRICTER RULES
It is unclear how the illegal factories are sourcing plastic waste. Zuraida said some of the 95 companies that have a permit to import and recycle such waste are subcontracting to illegal factories as they lack the capacity to handle such volumes. 
Malaysia's imports of plastic waste from its 10 biggest source-countries jumped to 456,000 tonnes between January and July, versus 316,600 tonnes purchased in all of 2017 and 168,500 tonnes in 2016.
The United States, the world's top exporter of plastic waste, sent 178,238 tonnes of such waste to Malaysia between January and July, nearly twice as much as it sent to second top destination, Thailand, according to the United Nations' trade database and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. 
Britain, another big plastic waste exporter, sends a quarter of its waste to Malaysia, also more than any other country.
Environment Minister Yeo estimated that the plastic recycling industry would earn Malaysia 3.5 billion ringgit ($841.95 million) this year.
Zuraida said she planned to introduce new rules soon that will make it harder for factories to qualify for an import license. 
""I understand plastic recycling is quite lucrative. So I am also thinking should we miss this economic opportunity? This is something the committee will study,"" Zuraida told Reuters.
If such an option is pursued, Malaysia would do so on strict terms, require high-end, green technology and allow factories to operate only in heavy industrial areas, she said.
The factories are currently located haphazardly, including near or within residential areas. In Kuala Langat, southwest of Kuala Lumpur, a massive recycling factory nestled between palm plantations was shut down three months ago.
But 10-foot (3 meter) tall towers of plastic waste - mostly consumer packaging material from the United States, Britain, France, Netherlands, Germany and Australia - were still piled in the front yard. A large plot of land next to the factory has been turned into a dumping site for scrap.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2018 02:54AM ET</span>",Former Malaysian PM Najib faces six more corruption charges over state funds,"By Rozanna Latiff and Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Former Malaysian premier Najib Razak was charged with six counts of criminal breach of trust involving government funds worth more than $1.5 billion on Thursday, adding to the 32 charges he already faces for money laundering and graft.
His former treasury chief, Irwan Serigar Abdullah, was also charged with criminal breach of trust, becoming the highest-ranking civil servant to be charged since Najib was unexpectedly ousted in a general election in May. 
The two pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Each charge carries a jail term of up to 20 years, a financial penalty and a whipping sentence, but both Najib and Irwan would be exempted from whipping as they are over the age of 50.
""Nothing in the charges show that any of the acts I undertook resulted in any benefit to me,"" Najib said at a press conference after the court hearing.
""There shouldn't be any belief that any of the monies stated in the charges were lost, or that there were any elements of self-interest.""
The new administration led by Mahathir Mohamad has been cracking down on corruption and has charged several former senior government officials, including Najib's former deputy.
A particular focus is how billions of dollars went missing from state fund 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), founded by Najib in 2009.
Four of the six charges filed on Thursday involving about 4.78 billion ringgit relate to a settlement agreement between 1MDB and Abu Dhabi state fund IPIC, said Azam Baki, a deputy commissioner at the anti-graft agency. 
In 2017, 1MDB had agreed to pay $1.2 billion to the Abu Dhabi fund, in a settlement agreement following a dispute between the two over bond payments, according to the companies.
The 1MDB-linked charges allege Irwan and Najib committed the breach of trust offense with 220 million ringgit of government funds meant for Kuala Lumpur International Airport Berhad, 1.3 billion ringgit meant for a subsidy and cash aid program and 3.3 billion ringgit of other government funds. 
Najib's lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said his client did not personally benefit from these transactions. 
""These were funds that were initially allocated for a purpose, but on priority was revised, in the face of urgency and dire straits the nation was placed into. For the purposes of settlement of the IPIC issue, an executive decision had to be undertaken very honestly,"" Shafee told the court. 
He said the other two charges relate to a pipeline project and the East Cost Rail Link (ECRL), a $14 billion project that was the centerpiece of China's infrastructure push in Malaysia. 
The project, signed under Najib's premiership, was suspended by Mahathir who has said the deal was ""unfair"" to Malaysia.
BAIL AMOUNT
The judge released Najib and Irwan after setting a bail of 1 million ringgit each. 
Prosecutors had earlier asked for 3 million ringgit bail for Najib, but the former premier's lawyers said it was getting difficult for Najib to settle bail after having paid 4.5 million ringgit in bail since July.
""I would like to ask that my client is given at least three weeks for him to settle the 1 million bail because it has become very difficult for my client, even before and in the latest case,"" Shafee said, adding Najib's bank accounts remain frozen.
The judge ordered the bail be paid in 10 days. 
Najib is already facing 32 money laundering, graft and breach of trust charges over transactions linked to 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is due to begin next year. 
His wife, Rosmah Mansor, was charged with money laundering earlier this month and had to pay bail of 2 million ringgit.
U.S. authorities allege that $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB and that about $700 million was diverted into Najib's personal bank accounts.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Leaders of Singapore's only parliamentary opposition party have appealed to supporters for financial help, saying they face the risk of bankruptcy as costs mount in civil cases they are fighting.
The three officials are being sued by two town councils controlled by the party between 2011 and 2015 for more than S$30 million ($21.7 million) in damages. The councils say the trio failed in their fiduciary duties - claims the defendants say are unfounded.
The three can lose their parliamentary seats if declared bankrupt, which will cut the party's seats to six in the 100 -seat assembly dominated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).
""We need financial resources to fight the legal battle and to deal with the prospect of being made a bankrupt,"" party chief Pritam Singh, former leader Low Thia Khiang, and party chair Sylvia Lim said in a joint post on a website set up to appeal for support in their case.
They said they have used personal savings and financial support from friends to pay almost S$600,000 in legal fees and will continue to fight the claims against them.
Singh took to the witness stand on Thursday in the hearing, which is expected to continue until early November.
The trio are being sued in separate cases by the town councils for wrongful payments made to companies. In one of the cases, audit reports by accounting firm KPMG said it had found ""pervasive"" management failures.
Town councils manage public housing developments, including any shops and community services within them.
Singapore politics has long been dominated by the PAP, which has won all the elections since the island's independence in 1965 with significant majorities. The next general election is due by early 2021.
""We have acted in good faith, and did what we believed to be in the best interests of our residents and the Town Council,"" the Workers' Party leaders said in the post.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A senior Khmer Rouge figure who ran Cambodia's most notorious prison during the genocidal regime is in intensive care in hospital, but his health has stabilized, the director of a prison where he is serving a life sentence said on Thursday.
Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch, was the first Khmer Rouge commander convicted of crimes against humanity in 2010, and sentenced in 2012 after a UN-backed tribunal rejected his appeal claim that he was a junior official following orders.
He was hooked up to an intravenous drip after being admitted to hospital at the weekend, but was able to talk, said Chat Sineang, the director of the Kandal Provincial Prison where Duch is serving his sentence. 
""I asked him whether he wanted us to let his family know
about his sickness and he said there was no need,"" Chat Sineang told Reuters.
""He was able to talk. He's still in an emergency unit attached to an IV drip.""
The 75-year-old Duch was taken to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in the capital Phnom Penh on Saturday, following diarrhea and breathing problems, he added. 
Up to 2 million people, or about a third of the population, are believed to have been killed or died of overwork and starvation during the Khmer Rouge's 1975-1979 reign of terror in Cambodia. Many were bludgeoned to death in mass executions.
The Supreme Court ruled that Duch, as the commander of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, codenamed S-21, should take full responsibility for the estimated 14,000 people killed there during the Khmer Rouge regime.
Two other accused, Nuon Chea and former head of state Khieu Samphan, are on trial for war crimes and genocide.
Now in their 80s and in declining health, they were sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for crimes against humanity.

Most Cambodians now alive were born after the bloody era.

U.S.-Cuban relations have deteriorated sharply since Donald Trump became president, returning to Cold War characterizations of Cuba and tightening trade and travel restrictions that had been eased by his predecessor Barack Obama.
Under Obama and former Cuban President Raul Castro, the United States and Cuba had restored diplomatic relations and forged a closer relationship.
""We regret the U.S. government is advancing on a course of confrontation with Cuba,"" Rodriguez told a 1-1/2 hour news conference in Havana.
Last week a senior Trump administration official said the White House planned to ramp up economic pressure on Cuba's military and intelligence services, as well as on Venezuela. 
Rodriguez also accused the United States of pressuring countries to reject a resolution Cuba will present at the U.N. General Assembly next week for the 27th year calling for an end to the U.S. economic embargo on the country.
He said Washington was trying to use human rights as a pretext to justify the embargo that itself ""violates the human rights of the Cuban people.""
Last week the United States presented a campaign on the plight of Cuban political prisoners at the United Nations. Protesting Cuban and Bolivian diplomats drowned out the launch by shouting, chanting and banging their hands on desks. 
The United Nations has traditionally voted overwhelmingly to condemn the embargo. Last year, the resolution was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly with 191 votes in favor.
Only the United States and Israel rejected the resolution which is non-binding but can carry political weight. Only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo, put in place more than 50 years ago.

Following a news conference focused on what Rodriguez called the U.S. decision to advance down a ""path of confrontation,"" he said Diaz-Canel would also transit through some western European capitals, without offering details.
Tensions between the island and the United States have escalated under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has reverted to Cold War characterizations of Cuba and partially rolled back the detente embarked upon by his predecessor Barack Obama.
Cuba and the Europe Union have improved relations in recent years, with the EU dropping all sanctions on the Communist-run island and negotiating a political dialogue and cooperation agreement.
Diaz-Canel, who took office from his mentor Raul Castro in April, made his first visit abroad as president to ally Venezuela. 
In September, Diaz-Canel made his first visit to the United States to participate in the United Nations General Assembly.
China and Vietnam are leading trading partners for Cuba, and trade with Russia has increased in the last two years as the countries renewed commercial, military and political ties.
Cuba has little trade with North Korea and Laos but maintains strong bilateral relations with them.

(Reuters) - A gunman walked into a Kentucky supermarket on Wednesday and shot a man dead then left the store and killed a woman in the parking lot, police said.
An armed bystander exchanged gunfire with the suspect in the lot of the Jeffersontown store before the shooter fled in a car. He was taken into custody soon afterwards, Jeffersontown Police Chief Sam Rogers said at a news briefing outside the store. There were no further injuries, he said.
The victims appeared to have been random and police did not offer a motive for the shooting that took place around 2:30 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) at a  Kroger Co  (N:KR) supermarket about 15 miles (24 km) from downtown Louisville, Rogers said.
""It does appear she was a random victim out in the parking lot,"" said Rogers. Asked if the male victim in the store was also killed at random, Rogers said. ""It does appear to be possibly the case.""
The names of the suspect and victims have not been released.
Steve Zinninger told Wave3 News that his father was waiting outside the supermarket while his mother shopped inside when he heard shooting and saw panicked people running from the store. 
Zinninger said the shooter casually walked toward his father in the parking lot and his father drew his gun and confronted the man from behind his car.
""He (the armed man) said, ‘please don’t shoot and I won’t shoot you,’ whites don’t kill whites,” Zinninger told Wave3 News.
Wave3 News reported that the female victim was black.
It was not clear whether Zinninger's father was the armed bystander who Rogers said exchanged gunfire with the suspect.
Video taken by a store owner showed the suspect wandering around the parking lot as bystanders shouted his location to police. The man then sped off, chased by a police officer on foot.
""Thanks to the quick response of the local police department, the suspect was apprehended and our store is secure,"" Kroger said in a statement.
Drew Butler said he was shopping in the store when he heard multiple shots. He and a woman barricaded themselves inside a room.
""After the fourth shot, I don’t know if there were five or fifteen,” Butler told Wave3 news.
Rogers said both the man and woman were shot multiple times.

SULAIMANIYA, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's new Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi was sworn in on Wednesday with only a partial Cabinet after lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on key postings including interior and defense.
A rowdy parliament session to approve Abdul Mahdi's government list created more uncertainty for Iraq, months after an inconclusive election, with parties and blocs wrangling over appointments.
The new premier faces the daunting task of rebuilding much of the country after a devastating war against Islamic State, as well as solving acute economic problems and power and water shortages.
Eight ministries have yet to be decided, ahead of a Nov. 2 deadline.
Among the 14 ministers who were sworn in, Thamer Ghadhban became Oil Minister and veteran Kurdish politician Fuad Hussein Finance Minister.
Ghadhban replaced Jabar al-Luaibi, who was recently made head of the new National Oil Company. Ghadhban helped resuscitate a flagging oil industry after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. He was interim oil minister from 2004-5 and a former energy advisor to outgoing premier Haider al-Abadi.
Abdul Mahdi was initially expected to nominate a full 22-member cabinet, including the defense and interior ministers. 
But lawmakers from Moqtada al-Sadr's bloc Saeroon, Abadi's Nasr Alliance, Vice President Ayad Allawi's Wataniya, and Sunni Muslim blocs left the room before voting on the remaining eight posts could take place.
""We decided to withdraw from the session, because we are not satisfied with the rest of the cabinet candidates,"" said Nasr lawmaker Ali Sined. ""It's enough to approve 14 ministers.""
Parliament will reconvene on Nov. 6 to vote on the remaining ministers, Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said. 
The unruly parliamentary session underscored the difficulties faced by Abdul Mahdi as he seeks consensus over his cabinet. 
A May general election saw Saeroon come first after campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. After uncertainty over the results, lawmakers eventually voted in President Barham Salih, the first time in modern Iraqi politics they picked a president, premier or parliament speaker without a backroom deal.
On Wednesday, however, some lawmakers accused proposed ministers of being former Saddam stalwarts, or corrupt.
The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent sacking of all of Saddam's Baath party officials stoked sectarian tensions, which then exploded into civil war. Under a de facto power sharing agreement, Iraq's presidency is now traditionally held by a Kurd, the premiership by a Shi'ite and the parliament speaker is a Sunni.
Earlier in the day, a Sunni Arab parliamentary bloc pulled out of talks on forming the government.

MAPASTEPEC, Mexico/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Thousands of Central American migrants began arriving at a town in southern Mexico on Wednesday on their march toward the United States, where President Donald Trump has declared them unwelcome and threatened to cut off aid to their home countries.
Men, women and children, mostly from Honduras, had set out early on foot from the town of Huixtla in the southern state of Chiapas to continue their slog toward the U.S. border, more than 1,100 miles (1,770 km) away. They began arriving in the town of Mapastepec, about 35 miles to the northwest, by the afternoon.
Their trek has drawn the ire of Trump, who has used the migrant caravan to fire up support for his Republican party ahead of Nov. 6 congressional elections.
It has also prompted Washington to put pressure on the Mexican government to halt the migrants' progress.
The caravan, which began as a march of a few hundred people from the crime-wracked Honduran city of San Pedro Sula back on Oct. 13, has swelled into the thousands as it was joined by migrants from El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
Mexican immigration authorities have told the migrants they will not be able to cross illegally into the United States, but private citizens have offered them supplies and rides.
Alex Mensing of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a group that organized a previous migrant caravan that angered Trump in April, said on Wednesday the current caravan comprises about 10,000 people. 
Pueblo Sin Fronteras is accompanying the caravan, which Mensing forecast would fragment in due course.
""It's very unlikely that 10,000 people will arrive together at a border city between Mexico and the United States,"" he told a conference call with reporters.
""There will be people who stay in Mexico, there will be people who go to different borders because everyone has their own plan and different support where they have family members.""
In Huixtla, residents and religious groups donated clothes, and local authorities provided vaccines, water and food.
""The people of Mexico have given us much more than we expected,"" said Honduran migrant activist Argelia Ramirez, one of a shifting group of de facto speakers for the caravan.
Neris Wong, who had walked for days from her native Honduras, covered her face with her hands as a medical worker at Mapastepec's town square tended a blister on her foot.
""I walked so much that I hurt myself. I don't have the right shoes for walking,"" Wong said.
Mexican authorities have tried to walk a fine line between responding to Trump's demands to close its borders while also respecting migrants' rights.
Mexico's interior ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday that about 4,500 people reached Huixtla, around 30 miles (50 km) north of the Guatemalan border. Reuters could not independently verify how many people had assembled in Huixtla.
The migrants camped out in the open on Tuesday night under pouring rain, with many seeking shelter in doorways or under shop awnings and bedding down early to prepare for the hike.

A separate group of least 1,000 migrants, also mostly Hondurans, has been moving slowly through Guatemala toward Mexico. Some media put the number above 2,000.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China, backed by Russia, failed on Wednesday to stop a United Nations Security Council briefing by the chair of a U.N. inquiry that accused Myanmar's military of genocide against Rohingya Muslims and urged the 15-member council to push for justice. 
""Atrocities continue to take place today,"" Marzuki Darusman, chair of the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar, told reporters ahead of the council briefing. ""It is an ongoing genocide that is taking place.""
Global pressure is mounting on Myanmar to act on accountability after a Myanmar military crackdown in the western state of Rakhine last year drove some 700,000 of the largely stateless minority over the border into Bangladesh.
Darusman told the Security Council that remaining Rohingya in Rakhine were ""at grave risk"" and returning those who have fled ""in this context is tantamount to condemning them to life as sub-humans and further mass killing.""
Myanmar has rejected the findings of the U.N. report.
""We are willing and able to take on the accountability issues for any alleged human rights violation where there is sufficient evidence,"" Myanmar's U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan told the Security Council.
The military crackdown followed attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts. Myanmar has denied committing atrocities against the Rohingya, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants.
""The crimes we have heard echo those committed in Rwanda and Srebrenica some twenty years ago. The Security Council acted in those two situations. It acted too late to prevent them which is all to our lasting shame but it did act to ensure accountability,"" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce told the council. 
Britain coordinates council action on Myanmar and Pierce said she would push for ""accountability that genuinely ends the Burmese military's impunity."" 
The U.N. inquiry's report, released in August, called for the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, targeted sanctions and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
""National sovereignty is not a license to commit crimes against humanity or genocide,"" Darusman told the council. ""The Rohingya and all of Myanmar's people, in fact the entire world, is looking at you to take action."" 
However, diplomats say council veto powers China and Russia are likely to protect Myanmar from any action. Myanmar's U.N. ambassador said the country would never accept an ICC referral.
Britain, France, the United States and six other members requested Wednesday's briefing, but China called a vote to try to stop it. Nine countries voted in favor of the briefing - the minimum needed - while China, Russia and Bolivia voted against and Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan abstained.
China's U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu told the council ""it should not get involved in country-specific human rights issues"" and that the briefing would be counterproductive to efforts to solve the situation.

Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the nine members who called the meeting of ""intentionally torpedoing"" council consensus on the issue.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 05:21PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russia opposes U.S. OneWeb satellite service, cites security concerns","By Maria Kolomychenko
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's state security agency is opposing a high-level deal for the U.S. OneWeb satellite startup to bring Internet access to remote parts of the country because it says the project could be used to gather intelligence and damage national security. 
OneWeb, which plans to use a constellation of hundreds of satellites to provide a worldwide Internet network, struck a deal with Russian space agency Roscosmos in 2015 to send them into orbit and it clinched a joint venture with a subsidiary of the agency to service Russia.
But now, after objections from Moscow, OneWeb is relinquishing its majority stake in the venture, according to two industry sources and a Russian state procurement document.
Speaking at a conference in Moscow, Federal Security Service official Vladimir Sadovnikov said the FSB was against the project servicing Russia for security reasons since it could potentially hand a foreign Internet service provider a monopoly over rural and remote areas.
""Some of Russia's regions would become totally dependent on a foreign satellite service,"" Sadovnikov said, adding that Moscow had not received any conclusive evidence that OneWeb's satellites would not be used for intelligence gathering.
""The only way to address the threats of foreign satellite networks like OneWeb, especially in the Arctic region and Far North, is to restrict their usage in Russia,"" Sadovnikov said. 
He added that Russia favored setting up a similar network partnering with India, China and countries which he described as non-aggressive. 
Moscow's ties with the West are at a post-Cold War low following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and rows over sanctions, Syria, alleged election meddling and a poisoning attack on a former spy in Britain. 
Sadovnikov conceded that there were satellite projects similar to OneWeb in scale such as Iridium which were already in use, but they were not used widely and are therefore not seen as a threat. 
Roscosmos and Oleg Ivanov, Russia's deputy minister for digital development and communications, declined to comment. 
RUSSIAN CONTROL
Late on Wednesday, OneWeb issued a statement to Reuters confirming that its joint venture with the Roscosmos subsidiary would be majority Russian owned and operated locally.
The OneWeb system ""is designed to fully respect the regulatory and cultural requirements of its many partner countries"", the statement said.
The company said it recognized that security was of paramount concern to every country in which OneWeb will operate. It said its system would ensure all Internet traffic remained secure. It said the OneWeb system would begin launching early next year.
Almost 45 percent of the world population does not have access to the Internet, according to Internet World Stats. OneWeb aims to make it available to everyone, including on aircraft and other high-speed transport. The project is meant to be fully online by 2027.
Russia is important to the success of the project as it has many remote and far-flung areas where high-speed broadband is not available. 
OneWeb was founded by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) manager Greg Wyler and closed an $1.7 billion investment deal with Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Bharti, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Hughes, Virgin Group, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank.
It plans to create a network of 900 satellites, most of which will be sent into orbit by 21 Soyuz launch vehicles from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Guiana Space Center. 
The contract for the launch was signed by OneWeb, Arianspace and Roscosmos in 2015. It will cost OneWeb $1 billion to have the satellites sent into orbit, Igor Komarov, Roscosmos' former CEO, said after signing the deal. 
The first launch was scheduled for late 2017, but the company has pushed the date back several times. The launch is now scheduled for between December 2018 and February 2019, according to Wyler. 
In 2017, OneWeb strengthened its partnership with Roscosmos by creating a joint venture with satellite operator Gonets, a subsidiary of Roscosmos, to develop the project in Russia. OneWeb currently holds a 60 percent stake and Gonets has the rest. 
However, Gonets now intends to increase its stake to 51 percent and is looking for a contractor to estimate the cost of the deal, a document submitted by Gonets in the Russian state procurement system showed. 
Gonets is a state company and is therefore required to publish details of all procurement orders in line with Russia's anti-corruption legislation. 
Two industry sources - one at the FSB, and the other an official at the Ministry for Digital Development and Communication - confirmed to Reuters that Gonets would become a controlling stakeholder in the joint venture with OneWeb.
This is a key condition for OneWeb operating in Russia, although there are other conditions as well, the source at the FSB said without detailing what those other conditions were. 
""OneWeb is an important project for Roscosmos and Russia's space industry, but national security issues come first. There are many doubts regarding that project, especially because of the sanctions against us,"" said the source at the FSB. 

OneWeb submitted a request to receive a frequency band in Russia, but was refused by authorities, according to Russian media reports confirmed by a communications official. A source at the Ministry for Digital Development and Communications said OneWeb would be given permission after legal issues regarding the joint venture were completed.

The press room overlooks the palace's central courtyard, letting journalists see visitors come and go. But soon after Macron took office last year, aides said he would relocate it from within the palace walls to a street nearby.
Late on Wednesday, Macron's office announced in a statement they would implement the plan by the end of the year even though the presidential press association, which represents accredited journalists covering Macron, has urged him to reconsider.
""This new press room will offer improved working conditions for a greater number of journalists,"" the Elysee said. 
Journalists said moving the office out of the Elysee would undermine a symbol of transparency and accountability, highlighting Macron's preferred communications strategy of using Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to bypass the media.
Although the Elysee said the move would help accommodate more journalists in a new, more secure environment, government sources told Reuters the main goal was to prevent easy access to advisers and staff who might leak sensitive information.

Asked this year about the future of the press room, Macron told reporters the planned relocation would be part of wider efforts to rearrange Elysee offices amid pressure to cut costs, while his aides said presidency staff needed a new meeting room.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Saudi crown prince vows to bring Khashoggi killers to justice,"By Marwa Rashad, Stephen Kalin and Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed on Wednesday that the killers of Jamal Khashoggi would be brought to justice, in his first public comments since the journalist's murder sparked global condemnation.
Striking a defiant tone, Prince Mohammed told international investors at a major conference in Riyadh that the furor over Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul would not derail the kingdom's reform drive.
His comments came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that as Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, the crown prince bore ultimate responsibility for the operation that led to Khashoggi's death.
""We will prove to the world that the two governments (Saudi and Turkish) are cooperating to punish any criminal, any culprit and at the end justice will prevail,"" Prince Mohammed said to applause.
The world's top oil exporter has come under increasing pressure over the death of Khashoggi, a columnist and one of the crown prince's most prominent critics.
The crisis has strained Riyadh's ties with the West and led dozens of Western politicians, top world bankers and company executives to boycott the conference that opened in Riyadh on Tuesday.
French President Emmanuel Macron told King Salman in a phone call on Wednesday that Paris, in coordination with partners, could take action against those held responsible for the murder, the Elysee palace said.
However, French reaction has been relatively guarded, as Paris tries to retain its influence with Riyadh and protect commercial relations spanning energy, finance and arms sales. From 2008 to 2017, Saudi Arabia was the second biggest purchaser of French arms, with deals totaling 11 billion euros ($12.7 billion), including 1.5 billion euros last year alone. 
Saudi Arabia first denied any involvement in Khashoggi's disappearance but a Saudi official eventually attributed his death on Oct. 2 to a botched attempt to return him to the kingdom. Turkey has dismissed Saudi efforts to blame rogue operatives and urged the kingdom to search ""top to bottom"" for those responsible. 
Britain, also a major weapons supplier to the kingdom, described Riyadh's explanations as lacking credibility. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that Britain would prevent all suspects in the killing from entering the country, shortly before she spoke to King Salman.
The Trump administration and the U.S. defense industry are scrambling to save the few actual deals in a much-touted $110 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia.
STRAINED TIES
Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia and Turkey would work together ""to reach results"" on a joint investigation and described cooperation between the two countries as ""special"", despite criticism from Ankara. 
""The incident that happened is very painful, for all Saudis... The incident is not justifiable,"" the crown prince said on a discussion panel at the conference.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Prince Mohammed on Wednesday and the two discussed the steps needed to bring to light all aspects of Khashoggi's death, a presidential source said. 
But in the bluntest sign yet of strained ties, one of Erdogan's advisers wrote in a Turkish newspaper that Prince Mohammed had ""blood on his hands"".
Saudi authorities did not respond to a request for comment about the remarks by Trump or the Erdogan adviser but Prince Mohammed painted a different picture of relations with Turkey.
""There are now those who are trying to take advantage of the painful situation to create a rift between the kingdom and Turkey,"" he said.
""I want to send them a message that they cannot do this as long as there a king named Salman bin Abdulaziz and a crown prince named Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, and a president in Turkey named Erdogan.""
In his comments to the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he wanted to believe Prince Mohammed when he said lower level officials were to blame for Khashoggi's death. But the U.S. president suggested responsibility lay higher up.
""Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,"" Trump said.
""DON'T SPREAD RUMORS""
The Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh was overshadowed by Khashoggi's killing, with more than two dozen high-level participants withdrawing.
But Saudi Arabia showed it could still do business despite the furor, signing deals worth $50 billion at the conference on Tuesday. The event was attended by hundreds of bankers and company executives.
Prince Mohammed, 33, the architect of Riyadh's reform drive, was upbeat on the economy, predicting growth of 2.5 percent this year.
He seemed relaxed on the panel he shared with Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa and Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. He joked about Hariri's detention in the kingdom last year, saying the Lebanese prime minister was free to leave after attending the conference.
""Prime Minister Saad is staying in the kingdom for two days so I hope you don't spread rumors that he was kidnapped,"" Prince Mohammed, who is also known as MbS, said.
Hariri, who has Saudi citizenship, was summoned to Riyadh a year ago, briefly detained and compelled to resign as prime minister in a speech read out on television from Saudi until France intervened to free him. 
ECONOMIC REFORM DRIVE
The Saudi central bank governor tried to reassure foreign banks that withdrew from the conference that they would not be penalized and may apply for licenses to operate in the country, the Middle East's largest economy. 
During the panel MbS touted Saudi Arabia's success in its efforts to transform its oil-dependent economy and make the deeply conservative kingdom a more tolerant society. 

Despite the boycott of the investment conference by big hitters, including in Wall Street, some senior international bankers including from HSBC and Japan's biggest lender MUFG attended.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Counting on victory, Brazil's Bolsonaro looks to shape policy","By Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's right-wing presidential front-runner, Jair Bolsonaro, has begun to shape policies and choose high-ranking ministers for the government he plans to form after his expected landslide victory in Sunday's run-off election.
Following a meeting at his home on Wednesday, rural caucus lawmakers said Brazil's agriculture and environment ministries may remain separate, apparently ditching Bolsonaro's plan for a merger that caused a storm of criticism from environmentalists.
""If it's best for Brazil that there is an agriculture and an environment ministry, we will talk about it after the election,"" his agriculture adviser Nabhan Garcia told reporters, indicating Bolsonaro was open to dropping his campaign promise to farmers.
Downgrading the environment ministry would be seen as contrary to Brazil's commitment to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, and could hurt Brazil's export market by angering environmentally aware consumers abroad. 
But another Bolsonaro promise to the farm lobby, the easing of gun control laws to allow them to arm themselves against rising crime in rural areas, could happen before he takes office on Jan. 1 if he defeats left-wing Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad as expected.
The Speaker of Brazil's lower chamber of Congress, Rodrigo Maia who aims to stay in the job, said he intends to move ahead with the issue after Sunday's vote.
""We have a well balanced bill. People want security on their farms and there are a lot of robberies and land invasions,"" Maia told reporters in Rio.
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain who has vowed to crackdown on corruption and crime, has said he will change the law to typify land invasions as criminal acts of terrorism.
Bolsonaro has been criticized for campaigning on generalities and avoiding debate on precise policy plans. He is expected to follow free-market economic policies under economist and investor Paulo Guedes, his pick for finance minister.
Selections to head ministries and state-owned companies will be announced within 30 days after the election, the head of Bolsonaro's PSL party, Gustavo Bebianno, said on Tuesday. 
Bolsonaro also intends to make changes in the leadership of state firms including Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (Eletrobras), Bebianno added.
""The menu already has many names. To avoid speculation, we will only give them after the election,"" he said.
Bebianno said central bank President Ilan Goldfajn was a ""good name"" to continue and Bolsonaro had not ruled him out. Bolsonaro and Guedes will make the decision, Bebianno said.
Controversy surrounding the use of mass online messaging in support of Bolsonaro has failed to derail his substantial lead over Haddad. An Ibope opinion poll on Tuesday showed Bolsonaro had 57 percent voter support to Haddad's 43 percent, slightly narrower than 59-41 percent in the previous survey.
Bolsonaro has denied Haddad's accusations that he asked supporters to fund mass messaging on the mobile messaging application WhatsApp, which would violate campaign laws. Brazil's top electoral court last Friday approved the opening of a probe into the matter.
Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman, has vowed to fight to let users forward text, audio and video messages over WhatsApp to hundreds of recipients. WhatsApp owner  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Tuesday it had no plans to change its restrictions in the country that limit message forwarding to 20 recipients at a time.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",Russia will target European countries if they host U.S. nuclear missiles: Putin,"By Olesya Astakhova and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would be forced to target any European countries that agreed to host U.S. nuclear missiles following Washington's withdrawal from a landmark Cold war-era arms control treaty.
Speaking at a news conference after holding talks with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Putin said he wanted to discuss what he called dangerous U.S. plans to leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with U.S. President Donald Trump.
The two leaders are expected to hold talks in Paris on Nov. 11.
Russia has called Trump's decision to quit the 1987 treaty, which eliminated both countries' land-based short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles from Europe, dangerous. Trump has accused Russia of violating the treaty, something Moscow denies. It says Washington is the one violating it. 
U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton told Putin on Tuesday that Washington would press ahead with plans to quit the pact despite objections from Russia and some European countries.
Putin told reporters on Wednesday that Russia would have to respond in kind and would do so swiftly if the United States quit the pact.
""Answering your question directly, can we respond,"" Putin said, when asked what Russia would do if Trump made good on his pledge to leave the treaty. ""We can, and it will be very fast and very effective,"" he said. 
""If the United States does withdraw from the INF treaty, the main question is what they will do with these (intermediate-range) missiles that will once again appear. 
""If they will deliver them to Europe, naturally our response will have to mirror this, and European countries that agree to host them, if things go that far, must understand that they are putting their own territory at risk of a possible counter-strike.""
LOOMING ARMS RACE
Putin said he did not understand why it was necessary to put Europe in such danger, saying it was a situation that Russia itself wanted to avoid if possible.
NATO's top official on Wednesday blamed Russia for breaching the treaty, but said he did not believe the Russian threat would lead to new deployments of U.S. missiles in Europe.
Russia has the option of deploying intermediate-range missiles in its European exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, a move that would put a swath of Europe in range.
Putin said he feared the world might be about to slip into an arms race, saying the fate of another U.S.-Russian arms control treaty - the new START pact - which governs strategic nuclear missile launchers and is due to expire in 2021, was also unclear.

""If all this is dismantled, then nothing will be left when it comes to limiting the increase in arms,"" said Putin. ""And then the situation will be, in my view, extremely dangerous. All that will be left is an arms race.""

ANTAKYA, Turkey (Reuters) - A Japanese journalist held hostage by Islamist militants for 40 months left for Japan from Turkey on Wednesday after being freed and said he was happy to be going home.
Jumpei Yasuda, a 44-year-old freelance journalist who was reported to have been captured by an al Qaeda affiliate after entering Syria from Turkey in 2015, was released a day earlier after three years in captivity.
Japanese diplomats in Turkey earlier confirmed that the released man was Yasuda, and Japan's foreign minister said the journalist would be brought home as soon as possible.
Speaking to Reuters on board a flight from Antakya in southern Turkey en route to Istanbul, from where he flew back to Tokyo, Yasuda said he did not know what the future held for him.
""I am happy that I can return to Japan. At the same time, I don't know what will happen from here or what I should do,"" he said. ""I am thinking about what I need to do.""
He also said he had not spoken Japanese for 40 months and was struggling to find the right words.
In an earlier video released by Turkish officials, Yasuda gave thanks for his freedom and said he was safe. 
""My name is Jumpei Yasuda, Japanese journalist. I have been held in Syria for 40 months, now in Turkey. Now I'm in safe condition. Thank you very much,"" a bearded Yasuda said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had earlier voiced relief, while still waiting for confirmation of the identity of the freed man.
Both Abe and Foreign Minister Taro Kono thanked Qatar and Turkey for their cooperation in freeing the man. A government spokesman said that no ransom was paid for Yasuda's release.
""He looks to be in good health, but our staff will check his condition and transport him to Japan as soon as possible,"" Kono told reporters earlier on Wednesday.
Yasudo's three years in captivity were not the first time he had been detained in the Middle East.
He was held in Baghdad in 2004 and drew criticism at home for drawing the government into negotiations for his release.
In Tokyo, Yasuda's parents spoke to reporters outside their house.
Yasuda's mother, Sachiko Yasuda, choked back tears as she clutched a white handkerchief.
""I could do nothing but pray. So I've been praying every day,"" she said.
His father, Hideaki Yasuda, said all he wanted was to see his son in good condition.
""Above everything else, I want to see him being fine,"" he said. 

""When he's back, I want to tell him one thing, and that'll be 'good job hanging in there',"" he said.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:35PM ET</span>",UK PM May receives show of loyalty after talk of leadership challenge,"By William James, Kylie MacLellan and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May received a show of support from her Conservative Party on Wednesday at a meeting in parliament, shifting the focus away from talk of an imminent leadership challenge over her Brexit strategy.
May has angered both supporters of Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers since failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week by raising the possibility of extending a post-Brexit transition period to help ease the deadlocked negotiations.
But her arrival at the packed meeting was greeted with cheers and some of those who heard her speak said it had gone well. Other attendees complained the event had been heavily stage managed to distract from their dissatisfaction.
May had asked to address the powerful ""1922 Committee"" after persistent criticism over the direction of the Brexit talks. 
""She's brilliantly united the party ... well at least for tonight,"" said one pro-Brexit lawmaker who attended the meeting.
With just over five months to go until Britain's scheduled departure from the EU on March 29, May's Brexit negotiations have stalled over a disagreement on a fallback plan for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. 
Many business leaders and investors fear internal party politics could scupper an agreement, thrusting the world's fifth largest economy into a ""no-deal"" Brexit they say would spook markets and clog up the arteries of trade.
Indeed, sterling has already weakened in recent days over the prospect of a leadership challenge.
""People spoke very freely to her about their concerns but a lot of people came back to the fact that they really wanted her to realize that they backed her in delivering for the country and for government,"" said former interior minister Amber Rudd as she left the meeting.
""PULL TOGETHER""
An Ipsos MORI poll on Wednesday showed a record 78 percent of voters lacked confidence in May to get a good deal from Brussels, compared with 70 percent in September. 
""And yet, the public don’t put all the blame at her door – and nor is there much evidence that they would have much more confidence in anyone else,"" said Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI.
Many Conservative Party lawmakers are wary of toppling a leader on the eve of Britain’s most significant political and economic move since World War Two. Many also fear an election could bring the opposition Labour Party into power.
""There is an appetite among the majority of the party to pull together because the risks are too high,"" said another lawmaker who attended the meeting but spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Ever since losing her party its majority in parliament with a botched bet on a 2017 snap election, May has faced talk of a leadership challenge. 
A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the 1922 Committee to demand such a vote.
The number of letters held by the committee chairman is not made public. The Sunday Times newspaper said 46 had now been sent and the BBC's political editor said on Monday that the 48 number had not yet been reached. 
But, with the Brexit clock ticking down and little sign of a plan to satisfy her critics, there was a change of tone in the British media this week, upping the ante before the meeting.
Some newspapers carried unusually bloodthirsty language by unidentified opponents. One said May was entering ""the killing zone"", while another said May should ""bring her own noose"" to the meeting.

Lawmakers said that language crossed a line for many Conservatives and had been a point of common concern for those speaking in the meeting.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:34PM ET</span>",NATO chief sees new U.S. missile deployments in Europe as unlikely,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO's top official on Wednesday blamed Russia for breaching a landmark nuclear arms pact that Washington is talking about quitting, but said he did not believe the Russian threat would lead to new deployments of U.S. missiles in Europe.
The NATO allies are due to meet on Thursday to hear Washington explain the thinking behind President Donald Trump's move to quit the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which rid Europe of land-based nuclear missiles.
European allies see the INF treaty as a pillar of arms control and, while accepting that Moscow is violating it by developing new weapons, are concerned its collapse could lead to a new arms race with possibly a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles stationed on the continent.
In his first remarks since Washington announced on Saturday that it planned to pull out of the INF Treaty, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg lay blame on Russia for violating the treaty by developing the SSC-8, a land-based, intermediate-range Cruise missile which also has the name of Novator 9M729.
But he said he did not think this would lead to reciprocal deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe as happened in the 1980s.
""We will assess the implications for NATO allies, for our security, of the new Russian missile ... but I don't foresee that allies will station more nuclear weapons in Europe as a response to the new Russian missile,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
He spoke a day after senior U.S. official John Bolton informed Russian President Vladimir Putin of the plans in Moscow.
Trump has said that the United States will develop new intermediate-range missiles unless Russia and China agree to halt development of their own. 
Military experts believe the United States would be better off modernizing its long-range missile deterrent and ensuring that it could penetrate sophisticated Russian air defenses, rather than developing a new class of medium-range rockets. 
""It's an extremely dangerous intention,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of Trump's comments when asked about them by reporters on a conference call. ""It will make the world more dangerous.""
The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.
U.S. Cruise and Pershing missiles deployed in Britain and West Germany were removed as a result while the Soviet Union pulled back its SS-20s out of European range.
But since 2014, the United States accuses Russia of breaching the INF by developing the SSC-8 though Moscow denies it is in violation and says the planned U.S. withdrawal from the INF pact is dangerous.
""All allies agree that the United States is in full compliance ... the problem, the threat, the challenge is Russian behavior,"" Stoltenberg said. ""NATO is in favor of arms control but to be effective, arms control agreements have to be respected by all parties,"" Stoltenberg added.
STRAIN ON NATO
A U.S. exit from the INF treaty would put another strain on NATO allies already shaken by Trump's demands for higher defense spending by the Europeans.
""It is another headache for the secretary general because there is no agreement in NATO about what to do,"" said Lukasz Kulesa, an arms control expert at the European Leadership Network think-tank. ""European allies are not really sure where the U.S. strategy is going,"" he said.
The treaty requires the United States and Russia ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.""
At a NATO summit in July all 29 allies, including the United States, said they were ""fully committed to the preservation of this landmark arms control treaty."" 
NATO envoys are due to be briefed by a U.S. arms control official on Thursday in Brussels. They are concerned about the fate of other arms control and safety pacts with Russia, including the 2010 New START nuclear treaty which can be extended beyond 2021 by mutual agreement.

Stoltenberg said he still hoped the United States and Russia could agree to extend the New START treaty, which also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers, although Trump has described it as a bad deal.

A Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 has conducted frequent air strikes targeting the Iran-aligned Houthi group and has often hit civilians, although it denies doing so intentionally.
Medics and residents in Bayt al-Faqih, a town 70 km (40 miles) south of Hodeidah city, said twelve people were also wounded.
They said bombs fell on a vegetable packaging factory in aal-Masoudi neighborhood and the victims were workers there.
Houthi media said 19 were killed and 10 were wounded in the same area.
Residents said violent clashes erupted in the southern outskirts of Hodeidah, a port city that pro-government forces have been trying to capture from the Houthis since the renewal of an offensive in September.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said the alliance is investigating the incident.
""We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated, as all reports of this nature are, using an internationally approved, independent process. Whilst this is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further,"" he said.
The coalition sometimes admits ""errors"" and pledges to hold accountable anyone who caused civilian deaths.
The coalition entered Yemen’s conflict after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country, already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula, to the verge of widespread famine.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Argentine police fire rubber bullets at anti-austerity protesters,"By Gabriel Burin and Maximilian Heath
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and waters cannon at protesters who marched on Wednesday in front of Congress against the government's 2019 budget bill, which contains steep spending cuts aimed at erasing the country's fiscal deficit.
Thousands of activists gathered, led by teachers, social organizations and leftist groups opposed to President Mauricio Macri's austerity measures. Small clusters of protesters hurled rocks, sticks and trash at police who shot rubber bullets and used metal barriers to control the crowd.
Some protesters were seen hurling tear gas canisters back at police lines. Authorities quickly reinforced with a large group of motorcycle police who descended on the crowd.
The same riot control measures were used to push back protesters late last year when Congress approved cuts to Argentina's pension system.
Tensions are rising in Latin America's No. 3 economy, which is projected by the budget bill to contract 2.4 percent this year and 0.5 percent in 2019. Public utility subsidy cuts are forcing home heating and electricity bills higher, fueling inflation expected by the government at 42 percent this year.
The legislators began discussing the budget in a plenary session shortly before noon. Macri needs the budget to pass to maintain his economic adjustment plan and continue efforts to turn Argentina's recession-hit economy around.
As police moved to stem the violence, lawmakers inside the capitol building squabbled and argued loudly over sticking points, at times disregarding calls for order.
The budget features sharp reductions in government spending and tax increases aimed at cutting the primary fiscal deficit from a projected 2.7 percent of gross domestic product this year to zero in 2019. 
Macri has committed to balancing the budget at the behest of the International Monetary Fund, which signed a $57 billion standby financing agreement with the government earlier this year. Macri went to the fund for help after market jitters about the country's increasing debt load caused a slide in the peso.
The local currency is down about 50 percent so far this year. On Wednesday it weakened 1.35 percent 37.15 to the greenback. Argentina is in the emerging markets spotlight as it prepares to host a meeting of the G20 at the end of November. 
Analysts expect the budget to pass, but are cautious about the government's ability to implement austerity measures. Some economists also fear the government may relax austerity measures ahead of the 2019 presidential election for political gain. 
Because Macri's ""Cambiemos,"" or ""Let's Change"" party, does not hold a majority in either chamber of Congress, it negotiated with some provinces to minimize the social impact of budget cuts in exchange for votes needed to pass the bill.
""We have important support, based on an agreement signed by the president with provincial governments to ratify several measures, among them the approval of the national budget,"" Congressman Luciano Laspina, who is affiliated with Macri's political party, said in an interview with local station Radio Mitre.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Italian budget standoff may consign euro zone integration drive to slow lane,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An uncompromising challenge to EU budget rules by Italy is providing the first big test for reforms introduced to save the euro zone nine years ago as financial crisis threatened to tear it apart.
The reforms remain a work in progress, and in urgent need of fuller implementation before the bloc's next crisis strikes.
But the defiance from Rome that has locked it into an unprecedented standoff with Brussels - and given fresh legs to a discredited image of financially responsible northern euro zone nations pitted against a profligate south - seems certain to delay that process and probably dilute it for good.
In May 2010, the then 16 countries sharing the euro clubbed together to create a rescue fund whose first task was to save Greece from going bust.
The ensuing bailout program, only concluded in August when the country exited its third rescue package, produced a consensus that closer economic cooperation was needed to better protect the system against future shocks.
With that in mind, euro zone states are now moving toward giving their bailout fund new powers of economic monitoring.
They also aim to strengthen a second fund designed to protect the banking system, extend national guarantee schemes for bank deposits across the whole currency bloc and introduce a euro zone budget.
Germany and its neighbors insist that, before they take on more bloc-wide financial commitments, financial risks within it must be substantially reduced.
But as a populist government in debt-laden Italy lays out plans to spend more borrowed money in clear contravention of EU rules, the deposit scheme and euro zone budget are becoming a more distant prospects.
""It is going to be more difficult now. When you talk about deposit insurance, the appetite is smaller. Italy is an additional argument not to even think about it,"" one senior euro zone official said.
The EU is due to present the next phase of the integration package in December - and officials expect it to underwhelm.
""We are still heading for some minimalist package of reforms. We are going to get some ESM (bailout fund) strengthening, we are going to get the backstop to the Bank Resolution Fund and not a lot more,"" a second senior official said.
""The idea of a euro zone fiscal capacity does not seem to have a lot of viability, I am skeptical whether it will translate into something in reality,"" the second official said.
DISCIPLINE BY MARKETS
Italy's refusal to keep in check its bloated public finances also ruins the positive impression that southern countries - notably the bloc's third sovereign bailout recipient Portugal - made with reforms that helped counter the German focus on more fiscal discipline.
And it might bring back discussions, championed by Berlin, about setting up a debt restructuring mechanism for countries that lose market access - a fate that could theoretically befall Italy if investors begin to doubt its ability to repay a debt pile equivalent to 133 percent of GDP.
""My fear is that because of the situation in Italy, Germany can say that market discipline is a good thing because the (EU) Commission cannot enforce the rules,"" a third official said.
""Maybe this can also start to convince France, if we have countries that deliberately break the rules and don't really care about the Stability and Growth Pact (on fiscal discipline) any more,"" he said.
But while officials agree that ultimately only the markets hold the power to force Italy to change its fiscal policy - a view shared by the government in Rome - leaving it only to investors to exert pressure could be dangerous.
""The markets will discipline irresponsible behavior, but they do it very late and they do it in a very extreme way,"" the second official said.
The Pact requires governments to cut their structural deficits, which exclude one-offs and business cycle swings, every year until the books are balanced. Public debt must be cut every year too.
If they don't, the Commission can start disciplinary steps that can end in fines -- a prospect Rome now faces if it ignores the Commission's demand to change the 2019 budget so that the structural gap falls rather than rises. 
Italy has no supporters among other euro zone governments.
But with the challenge to Brussels having enhanced the popularity of ruling coalition heads Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio among domestic voters, it is still unlikely to yield.
Unless markets force them to, they certainly have no incentive to back down before European Parliament elections in May, officials believe.
This makes the current clash far more dangerous for Brussels and supporters of closer economic integration than previous spats over fiscal policy with France, Spain or Portugal, or indeed previous Italian administrations, a fourth official said. 

""In the past, we had to deal with governments breaking EU rules but at least willing to cooperate. In the case of Italy, we have an uncooperative government,"" the official said.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 10:59PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ecuador no longer to intervene with UK for WikiLeaks Assange - foreign minister,"By Alexandra Valencia
QUITO (Reuters) - - Ecuador does not plan to intervene with the British government on behalf of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in talks over his situation as an asylee in the South American country's London embassy, Ecuador's foreign minister said on Tuesday.
Foreign Minister José Valencia said in an interview with Reuters that Ecuador's only responsibility was looking after Assange's wellbeing, after the Australian national sued the country over new conditions placed on his asylum in the London embassy.
""Ecuador has no responsibility to take any further steps,"" Valencia said. ""We are not Mr. Assange's lawyers, nor are we representatives of the British government. This is a matter to be resolved between Assange and Great Britain.""
The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment after normal business hours.
Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer advising Assange, said in an email that ""developments in the case in recent times"" showed the need for Australia's government to intervene to assist ""one of its citizens who faces real danger.""
This position marks a departure from Ecuador's previous practice of maintaining dialogue with British authorities over Assange's situation since granting him asylum in 2012, when he took refuge in Ecuador's London Embassy after British courts ordered his extradition to Sweden to face questioning in a sexual molestation case.
That case has since been dropped, but friends and supporters have said that Assange now fears he could be arrested and eventually extradited to the United States if he leaves the embassy.
WikiLeaks, which published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets when Assange ran the operation, faces a U.S. grand jury investigation.
Valencia said he was ""frustrated"" by Assange's decision to file suit in an Ecuadorean court last week over new terms of his asylum, which required him to pay for medical bills and telephone calls and to clean up after his pet cat.
""There is no obligation in international agreements for Ecuador to pay for things like Mr. Assange's laundry,"" he said.
Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno has said that asylum is not meant to be eternal, but he has expressed concern about the possibility that Assange may be extradited to the United States. Valencia said on Tuesday that he has not discussed Assange's situation with the United States' government.

Last December, Ecuador granted Assange Ecuadorean citizenship and sought to name him as a member of the country's diplomatic mission in Britain and Russia, which could have assured him safe passage to leave the embassy. Britain denied the request.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A Salvadoran judge on Tuesday ordered the arrest of a former military officer suspected of ordering the 1980 killing of Archbishop Oscar Romero, a Latin American human rights icon recently named a Roman Catholic saint.
The order called for the arrest of Alvaro Rafael Saravia, a 78-year-old former soldier who has been a major suspect for years. His case was dismissed in 1993 after an amnesty law banned criminal trials connected to the Central American nation's bloody civil war.
Some 75,000 people died in the conflict that lasted from 1980 to 1992 during a military dictatorship. Romero, shot dead while celebrating Mass in a hospital chapel, is thought to have been killed by a right-wing death squad.
The murder was one of the most shocking of the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in which thousands were killed by military death squads.
No one was brought to justice in Romero's case. 
It was reopened in May 2017, a year after the controversial amnesty law was overturned.
Judge Rigoberto Chicas said there is sufficient evidence to charge Saravia for participating in Romero's killing, and ordered the police and Interpol to search for him, a court spokesman said. Saravia's wherabouts are unknown. 

Romero's homilies had blasted the U.S.-backed military dictatorship while voicing solidarity with the poor. Pope Francis declared him a martyr who had been killed for hatred of the faith. He was made a saint in October.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:34PM ET</span>","Publicity, transport, food: migrants flock to more caravans after Trump broadsides","By Delphine Schrank
TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - For years, an annual caravan of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico to the U.S. border received modest publicity until President Donald Trump condemned it in April, pitching the procession into the glare of the world's media - and into the homes of thousands of potential migrants.
Though only a fraction of the 1,500 migrants made it to the United States, coverage of their trek in vehicles and on foot inspired many considering the journey to see caravans as a safer way to travel than the perilous trip many had for years undertaken alone, dozens of migrants told Reuters.
""It was a real success,"" 20-year-old Honduran Antonio Perreira said of the impact of April's caravan, as he rested with 14 friends on the way to Mexico.
When another caravan set off in Honduras on Oct. 13, it quickly became larger than the one Trump had castigated six months earlier, swelling to an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people.
Perreira and his friends from Via Nova, a municipality near the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, were among them.
To stop the caravan, Trump has threatened to cut off aid to Central America and to close the U.S.-Mexico border. The mostly Honduran migrants will likely face bureaucratic hurdles in Mexico and possible deportation as they inch northward.
But even if it disperses, more caravans are forming, migrants say, posing a challenge to Mexico's government and offering Trump an opportunity to campaign hard on illegal immigration before Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Henry Martinez, 33, from Honduras, said relatives in his home town of Choluteca told him 1,000 more people were setting out from there at the end of last week.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the departure from Choluteca. However, Casa del Migrante, a migrant shelter in Guatemala City, said over 1,000 people who entered from Honduras were moving through Guatemala toward Mexico's border.
A solderer and painter who left behind four children and his wife with a heavy heart to search for work, Martinez said he started his journey with about $100. By Monday, that had dwindled to pennies.
Such destitution lies behind a caravan expected to leave San Salvador on Oct. 31, said one of its organizers, Alex, who declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals. At least 1,000 people have joined the caravan's WhatsApp group, he said.
Alex said he and his co-organizers contacted members of the Honduran caravan, who told them to seize the moment.
""They will go ahead, and we will follow,"" he said. ""How else can we leave our country? We have no money for food or travel.""
BORN ON FACEBOOK 
Born first as an idea on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the caravan gathered momentum as news of it spread fast on television, social media and word of mouth in Honduras, a country of nine million. 
In Santa Rosa de Copan, about 100 miles from San Pedro Sula, Adalberto Gonzalez, 22, stumbled into a gathering of townsfolk at a gym planning to catch up with the caravan.
A nurse who said he loved his job but had not been paid for a year, Gonzalez hustled out of town with a group the next morning. Gonzalez said he and others believed the caravan would protect them from robbers, rapists and corrupt police.
Daniel Morales, 22, said the streets and houses of his San Pedro Sula neighborhood Medina were ""abandoned"" and that he had left last week looking for work with 500 neighbors. It was not immediately possible for Reuters to verify his account. 
April's caravan reached the U.S. border with about 400 people amid the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy, which led to at least 2,500 mainly Central American children being separated from their parents.
But more than 50 Honduran migrants interviewed by Reuters in recent days said they were worried less about what would happen to them in the United States than the need to flee violence, unemployment and corruption at home.
All expressed deep skepticism that anything would change in Honduras.
Maria del Carmen, a Honduran single mother, squeezed a small daughter to her leg as she talked of being separated from her children. ""I put my faith in God,"" she said. She left a son in a pastor's care and headed north with her two small girls.
Around her, about 3,000 other people bedded down on a plaza in the Mexican city of Tapachula on cardboard and plastic bags or tucked themselves into doorways.
Many believe they have nothing more to lose.
""We don't care if Trump cuts off payments,"" said Alexander Fernandez, who told of losing ""everything"" - a thriving business with five employees, his car, his house - when the MS-13 gang extorted him out of his ironmonger's shop.

He walked fast with the caravan, carrying nothing but the clothes he was wearing and a cap to ward off the searing sun. ""That U.S. aid never reached us anyway.""

(Reuters) - Six young patients died and 12 others became sick following an outbreak of adenovirus at a rehabilitation center in Haskell, New Jersey, the state's Health Department said on Tuesday.
Adenoviruses frequently cause mild illness, with cold-like symptoms, particularly in young children. But the children affected in this case have compromised immune systems, the health department said. 
The 18 patients range in age from a toddler through young adulthood and most are under 18 years old, health department spokeswoman Nicole Kirgan said in an email. The department is not releasing exact ages of any patients because of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy reasons, Kirgan said.
The Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, which includes a pediatrics center, has been instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends, the department said.
""This strain of virus tends to cause outbreaks in centers of communal living and has ... unfortunately led to deaths,"" Dr. Shereef Elnahal, the state's health department commissioner, said on Twitter. ""We take this very seriously.""
Health department officials were at the center on Tuesday and also on Sunday and found minor hand-washing deficiencies, the department said. Health officials are working with the center on infection control issues.
The health department will continue an active on-site surveillance and has recommended measures to protect against the further spread of infection, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Twitter.
""Heartbroken that several children have lost their lives in an adenovirus outbreak in Haskell,"" Murphy said. 
After experiencing cases of adenovirus in its pediatric unit, the center notified government health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is fully cooperating with them and has sought out their guidance, the Wanaque center said in a statement emailed by Rowena Bautista, administrator of the center. 
""As a result, facility staff have diligently implemented all available infection control and prevention measures in order to protect the health and safety of the Wanaque Center’s residents,"" center officials said.
The facility's pediatrics center serves newborns to 22-year-olds who are ""medically fragile"" and provides an individualized program for each child, the center's website said. From preschool through high school, children learn in classrooms that are handicapped accessible and set up for ventilator use, it said.
Haskell is located about 32 miles northwest of New York.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A United Nations investigator voiced concern about human rights being sidelined during U.S. and South Korean talks with North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, warning on Tuesday: look at what happened in Myanmar.
Tomas Ojea Quintana is the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea, who reports on the rights situation to the U.N. General Assembly and the Geneva-based Human Rights Council. He held a similar role on Myanmar from 2008 to 2014 as the country began a transition to democracy from decades of harsh military rule. 
A year after the transition began in 2011, Quintana said he raised concerns about the Myanmar military committing crimes against humanity and called for a commission of inquiry. The Myanmar military has denied such accusations.
""The international community couldn't reach a decision in this respect - they were endorsing the transition, putting aside human rights, and now somehow we see the consequences,"" he said. 
A Myanmar military crackdown in Rakhine state last year against Rohingya Muslims drove some 700,000 of the largely stateless minority over the border into Bangladesh. A U.N. inquiry into the crisis accused Myanmar's military of genocide.
The crackdown followed attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts. Myanmar has denied committing atrocities against the Rohingya, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants.
Quintana said that while the situations in Myanmar and North Korea were not completely the same ""at some point we shouldn't undermine ... the principles of human rights because sooner or later it will come back.""
He said he strongly supported the rapprochement with Pyongyang and summits by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, but it was not clear if human rights had even been discussed. 
""The human rights situation at the moment has not changed on the ground in North Korea despite this important progress on security, peace and prosperity,"" Quintana told reporters, adding that what was needed now is ""a signal from North Korea that they will discuss human rights at some point.""
Japan and the European Union are again drafting an annual General Assembly resolution that traditionally condemns North Korea human rights abuses. North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights abuses.
North Korea's U.N. mission said in a statement on Monday that the General Assembly resolution politicizes human rights. 

""The human rights issue is found in Western countries where the misanthropy and abnormal way of life are rampant,"" the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested nearly 17,000 members of family units attempting to cross the U.S. border with Mexico in September, a 31 percent increase over the previous month, according to official statistics released on Tuesday.
In a news briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Trump administration officials pointed to the increase in migrant families as evidence of a ""border crisis"" because those groups are more difficult for immigration enforcement officials to detain and deport because of protections granted by U.S. law to migrant children.
President Donald Trump's administration has expressed alarm at the change in the makeup of migrants attempting to cross into the United States from mostly single adults to children and families traveling together.
About 40 percent of those apprehended in fiscal 2017 and 2018 were unaccompanied children or families with children, compared with 10 percent in 2012, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.
According to numbers released on Tuesday, U.S. border officials arrested nearly 397,000 people in total at the southern border in the 2018 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a significant increase over the 304,000 apprehended in 2017 but largely in line with arrest trends of migrants at the U.S. southern border over the past decade. 
Border arrests dropped in the months after Trump took office in January 2017 but have rebounded over the past year. Experts believe that Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric dissuaded potential migrants from crossing in the first months of his presidency.
Trump has vowed to begin cutting millions of dollars in aid to Central America over a caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants fleeing violence and poverty at home.
He has called the caravan, which is currently in southern Mexico, a national emergency as he seeks to boost his Republican Party's chances of maintaining control of Congress in the Nov. 6 elections.
Earlier this year, Trump's administration tried to deter families from traveling to the border by instituting a ""zero tolerance"" policy, separating thousands of children as their parents were prosecuted.
About 2,500 children and parents were separated before Trump abandoned the policy in June after a public outcry. A federal judge ordered the families reunited, a process that is still incomplete.

""There is now a clear and present danger of an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen: much bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said.
He described the scale of what was being faced in Yemen as ""shocking"" given that only two famines had been declared in the world in the past 20 years - Somalia in 2011 and a localized famine in South Sudan last year.
A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. Iran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis.
Lowcock said the United Nations currently coordinates the delivery of aid to some eight million people in Yemen and that the humanitarian crisis has been deepened by an economic crisis and continued fighting around the country's key Hodeidah port. Yemen traditionally imports 90 percent of its food.
He appealed for a humanitarian ceasefire, protection of the supply of food and essential goods across the country, a larger and faster injection of foreign exchange into the economy through the central bank, increased humanitarian funding and support, and for the warring parties to engage in peace talks.
""Beyond the sheer numbers, while millions of people have been surviving on emergency food assistance for years, the help they get is enough merely to survive. Not to thrive. The toll is unbearably high,"" Lowcock said. 

""The immune systems of millions of people on survival support for years on end are now literally collapsing, making them – especially children and the elderly – more likely to succumb to malnutrition, cholera and other diseases,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sandra Day O'Connor, a pioneer in the legal profession who made history in 1981 by becoming the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court and remained on the bench for a quarter century, announced on Tuesday that she has been diagnosed with dementia.
""Some time ago, doctors diagnosed me with the beginning stages of dementia, probably Alzheimer's disease,"" O'Connor, 88, said in a letter issued by the court. Alzheimer's is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills.
O'Connor, who had served as a state judge in her native Arizona, was appointed to the nine-member court by Republican former President Ronald Reagan during his first year in office and she retired in 2006. She was considered a centrist on the conservative-leaning court.
As a result of her diagnosis, O'Connor said she has withdrawn from public life.
""I will continue living in Phoenix, Arizona, surrounded by dear friends and family. While the final chapter of my life with dementia may be trying, nothing has diminished my gratitude and deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life,"" O'Connor added.
O'Connor became the Supreme Court's first woman justice nearly two centuries after the country's top judicial body was established in 1789, but her place in history went beyond breaking gender barriers.
    Over time, she emerged as the court's ideological center, casting key votes in cases on the most contentious issues of her era, including a ruling that helped preserve a woman's right to have an abortion and another upholding affirmative action - the use of racial preferences in student admissions - on college campuses.
When Republican former President George W. Bush replaced her with conservative Justice Samuel Alito, the already-conservative court moved further to the right.
""Justice O'Connor is of course a towering figure in the history of the United States and indeed the world,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. ""She broke down barriers for women in the legal profession to the betterment of that profession and the country as a whole.""
O'Connor grew up on a ranch in Arizona before attending Stanford University in California. She was one of only five women in her class at Stanford Law School. Although she graduated near the top of her class, she was rejected for most law firm jobs. 
    She and her husband, John, whom she met in law school, later settled in Phoenix where she became a prominent Republican politician in the state. She was elected as a state trial judge in 1974 and in 1979 was named to a state appeals court.
After retiring from the court, O'Connor dedicated herself to improving civics education, starting a group called iCivics that provided free online resources for middle and high school students. In 2009, Democratic former President Barack Obama presented her at the White House with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor a president can give.
O'Connor retired mainly so she could care for her husband, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Reagan, who died in 2004, also was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

An estimated 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer's, almost two-thirds of them women, according to the Alzheimer's Association. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.

TAPACHULA, Mexico/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - A group of more than a thousand Central Americans in Guatemala headed toward the Mexican border on Tuesday as the first caravan of migrants paused in southern Mexico on its planned journey toward the U.S. border.
U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to begin cutting millions of dollars in aid to Central America and called the caravan in Mexico a national emergency as he seeks to boost his Republican Party's chances in the Nov. 6 congressional elections.
The caravan, which has been estimated at 7,000 to 10,000 mostly Honduran migrants fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands, is currently in the town of Huixtla in Chiapas state around 31 miles (50 km) north of the Guatemalan border.
Mexico's government said in a statement on Tuesday that it had received 1,699 requests for refugee status, including children. The government estimates there are around 4,500 people in the group.
Hundreds of migrants were resting in Huixtla on Tuesday, as religious groups and companies donated clothes. Local authorities provided vaccines, food and drink.
""When we heard the caravan was coming (we joined)...people in Guatemala are also suffering from poverty. So this is an opportunity to improve my family's life,"" said Elsa Romero, a Guatemalan mother of four.
Migrant Alexander Fernandez said the column planned to move again early on Wednesday morning.
Separately, Casa del Migrante, a migrant shelter in Guatemala City, said more than 1,000 people who set out from Honduras were moving through Guatemala toward the Mexican border. Some local media said there were more than 2,000.
Trump and fellow Republicans have sought to make the caravan and immigration issues in the election, which will determine whether their party keeps control of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
Honduran authorities say that at least two men have died so far on Mexican roads during the advance of the caravan. One of the men fell off a truck in Mexico, and the other died trying to get onto a truck in Guatemala, authorities said.
The caravan in Mexico is still far from the United States border - more than 1,100 miles (1,800 km).
Mexico, which has refused Trump's demands that it pay for a border wall between the countries, tries to walk a fine line between showing solidarity with the Central American migrants and responding to Washington's demands to control its borders.
Mexico hopes to disperse the convoy long before it can reach the border, telling migrants to register with authorities in order to submit applications for asylum in Mexico.

That process can last weeks, and migrants are supposed to stay where they register while applications are processed. If they violate those rules, they face deportation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Saudi authorities staged the ""worst cover-up ever"" in the killing of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi this month. 
Asked by a reporter in the White House Oval Office how the Khashoggi killing could have happened, Trump said: ""They had a very bad original concept. It was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups."" 
Khashoggi's death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 has caused global outrage and strained relations between Riyadh and Washington. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was a U.S. resident and columnist for The Washington Post.
Trump's comments about the incident in recent days have ranged from threatening Saudi Arabia with ""very severe"" consequences and mentioning possible economic sanctions, to more conciliatory remarks highlighting the country's role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.
On Tuesday, Trump said the Khashoggi matter was handled badly by Saudi officials. ""Bad deal, should have never been thought of. Somebody really messed up. And they had the worst cover-up ever,"" Trump said.
Riyadh initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi's fate before saying he was killed in a fight in the consulate, a reaction that has met with skepticism from several Western governments, straining their relations with the world's biggest oil exporter.
The kingdom has since changed parts of its official narrative about the killing, further deepening international concern.

SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's (O:FB) messaging service WhatsApp has no plans to change its group messaging limits in Brazil, an executive said on Tuesday, resisting calls from the leading presidential candidate to allow easier forwarding of viral messages.
Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right lawmaker forecast to clinch the race on Sunday, vowed last week to ""fight"" to let users forward text, audio and video messages to hundreds of contacts on a platform that has become a key political battleground.
With few traditional campaign resources and almost no TV ads until this month, Bolsonaro stormed to the front of a crowded presidential race with an outsized social media presence and grassroots organizing via WhatsApp and other online platforms.
He denied accusations from his leftist rival Fernando Haddad last week that he had asked supporters to fund secret bulk messaging campaigns over WhatsApp, which would be a violation of electoral law.
Advocacy groups concerned with an explosion in the number of hoaxes and misleading propaganda texts and videos on the encrypted platform have called on WhatsApp to lower its forwarding limit in the country from 20 recipients to five, as is the case in India.
""We're pretty comfortable with that number 20,"" Victoria Grand, vice president of policy and communications at WhatsApp, told journalists in Sao Paulo on Tuesday. She called the policy as an ""experiment"" that ""could change over time.""
With just five days to go before the vote, she said there was no way that WhatsApp could change those limits before Brazilians choose their next president. She highlighted efforts to shut down accounts engaged in spamming activity, along with a marketing campaign encouraging users to be skeptical of rumors.
Independent fact checkers and social media experts say that has not been enough to stop a flood of falsehoods and conspiracy theories distorting political debate without public oversight.
""It is very worrying. We are walking on ice, because fake news is manufactured on an industrial scale, but the monitoring and fact checking is a slow and time-consuming process,"" said Thiago Tavares, head of SaferNet Brasil, a non-governmental organization that monitors social media for potential crime.
Tavares, a member of an advisory council to Brazil's top electoral court on social media and the election, is one of many calling for WhatsApp to further restrict forwarded messages that effectively turn the service into a broadcast platform.
Unlike Facebook's open platform, which the company monitors for abusive content, messages circulating in WhatsApp groups of up to 256 use end-to-end encryption, which keeps them hidden even from the platform's administrators.
WhatsApp has more than 120 million users in Brazil, a country of nearly 210 million people, rivaling the reach of Facebook's main platform in one of the company's biggest global markets.
BOLSONARO DECLINES DEBATE
Opinion polls show Bolsonaro has a lead of around 18 percentage points over Haddad, making a last-minute surge for the leftist candidate seem an increasingly distant possibility.
Haddad, running for the Workers Party (PT), has demanded that he and Bolsonaro debate before Sunday anywhere and in any format, saying Brazil's democracy will suffer if voters cannot hear and compare their ideas.
But Bolsonaro said in a radio interview on Tuesday that he would not do that, saying that he was not physically fit enough due to a near-fatal stabbing at a rally last month.
Haddad and his allies have said they are gravely concerned that Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old retired Army captain and seven-term congressman who has openly praised Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, could fall back into authoritarian ways.
A cadre of high-ranking ex-military brass have supported Bolsonaro and are poised to take powerful roles in government if he wins.
""We are not a threat to democracy. On the contrary, we are the guarantee for liberty and democracy,"" Bolsonaro said in the radio interview.
He pointed to the political corruption that grew under successive PT governments and involved every major party as evidence that a Haddad government would allow graft to continue. Haddad has said he would fight against corruption.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",German halt to Saudi arms sales could put squeeze on Eurofighter,"By Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's hardline halt to arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi may jeopardize a big UK-led Eurofighter order from Riyadh and could hit jobs at a shipyard in struggling northeastern Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been more outspoken than fellow major arms exporters the United States, Britain and France about stopping sales to Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi's case is cleared up, a stance that a senior conservative ally said could also affect previously approved orders.
Berlin is now reviewing all Saudi sales, including contracts approved in September for more patrol boats built by privately-held Luerrsen and four Cobra counter-battery radar systems built by a consortium that includes France's Thales, Airbus and the U.S. defense company  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).
German authorities approved more than 400 million euros worth of Saudi arms supply contracts in the first nine months of 2018, but have not specified the value of equipment not yet delivered.
Germany accounts for just under 2 percent of total Saudi arms imports, a small percentage internationally compared with the United States and Britain - but, crucially, also makes components for other countries' export contracts.
The biggest impact may be on a 10-billion-pound ($12.99 billion) agreement by Saudi Arabia to buy 48 new Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets from Britain, given that a third of their components would come from Germany, industry sources said.
The deal, nailed down in a memorandum of understanding in March, has not been finalised yet, and is not reflected in BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc's 2018 financial statements.
BAE declined to comment on the issue, as did officials from the German-based Eurofighter consortium. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment.
Nearly four years in the making, the Saudi Eurofighter order would secure thousands of jobs at BAE, and help extend production of the European warplanes until a next-generation fighter jet to be designed in coming years goes into production.
Saudi Arabia is also one of the few remaining export markets for the Eurofighter, given the warplane program's losses to the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet in other tenders, including a decision expected soon from Belgium. 
PATROL BOATS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Of more immediate concern are three patrol boats currently under construction at the Luerrsen shipyard in Wolgast, in the financially strapped northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It employs 300 people, Stern magazine reported. Of 33 boats ordered in total, 16 must still be approved, it said.
Luerssen declined to comment on the Saudi work, but said it would respect any political decision on the fate of the boats while underscoring the importance of the orders for the yard.
Germany has taken a far tougher approach on arms sales to Riyadh following Khashoggi's killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which has stirred international outrage, than major allies such as the United States, France and Britain.
U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced concern that shelving arms sales to Riyadh could push Saudi Arabia, its key Arab ally against Iran, to place orders with Russia and China.
Tim Stuchtey, executive director of the Brandenburg Institute for Society and Security (BIGS), said Germany faced a tough dilemma - whether to follow its moral instincts or pursue a realpolitik-led agenda of arms sales out of economic interest.
Merkel is guided in part by the March 2018 governing accord with her coalition partners, the left-leaning Social Democrats, who insisted on language that bans arms sales to any parties to the devastating war in Yemen - where Saudi-led Arab forces intervened in 2015 - except for certain previously approved items and those that will remain in the purchasing country.
Divergent views in Europe on the issue also underscore the challenges facing an ambitious Franco-German program to develop a future fighter jet, he said. ""As long as we don't have unified European rules for arms exports, we will always have this problem. It will be difficult to square French and British attitudes about arms exports with German moral imperatives.""
PRICE OF FOREIGN POLICY 
If Berlin does halt work on approved orders for the Saudi patrol boats, it may have to compensate the shipyard, which invested heavily to be able to execute the work, said Jan Techau, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think-tank.
""Ultimately, the question is, how much is a principled foreign policy worth,"" he said. ""If the shipyard in Wolgast suffers damage due to a policy shift, it may cost money. That's the decision they'll have to make.""
Arising in part from its Nazi past, Germany's cautious approach to weapons sales, and past moves to slow down approvals for exports, have raised eyebrows in other European countries.
It has already prompted France to market certain weapons as ""100 percent French"" - not subject to disruption by suppliers in other countries, according to one executive.
Norbert Roettgen, who chairs the German's parliament's foreign affairs committee, told broadcaster ZDF on Monday that Germany's credibility was at stake if it did not halt all arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia until the ultimate responsibility for Khashoggi's killing is established, or serious consequences were seen in Saudi Arabia.
But industry experts say blocking work on contracts vital to its partners also raises questions about Germany's viability and reliability as a partner for future projects.
""It's clear,"" Techau said, ""that global supply chains require agreements among partners, and that coordinated positions are needed on a European level, but that is not yet the case today.""

Ashraf Al-Qidra, spokesman for Gaza's health ministry, said 17-year-old Muntaser al-Baz died in hospital from being shot in the head by Israeli troops.
An Israeli military spokeswoman said soldiers had come under attack near the border fence and used riot dispersal means and live fire and had no details of Palestinian casualties who were on the Gaza side of the border.
She said one Gazan breached the fence trying to throw an explosive device at the troops and was shot. 
Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of the territory and the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel’s founding in 1948.
Since the protests began, 208 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan police on Tuesday won permission from a court to ask Chinese phone manufacturer Huawei to help recover data from a phone used by a police informant who has alleged a plot to kill President Maithripala Sirisena. 
Informant Namal Kumara said at a news conference last month he had discussed the plot by phone with a senior police officer. He has since been questioned but not charged with any offence.
Former Sri Lankan defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also a target of the plot, Kumara said.
Officials at the Criminal Investigation Department of police on Tuesday told the court that some of Kumara's phone data, which could be evidence, had been deleted and they needed Huawei's technical help to retrieve it.
Sri Lankan law prevents police from asking Huawei to help without first obtaining explicit permission from a court. The court granted it on Tuesday. 
A man named as M. Thomas from India's southern state of Kerala was arrested in Sri Lanka on Sept. 22 on suspicion of involvement in the plot. 
Thomas appeared in court on Tuesday and requested that he not remain in CID custody, saying there had been death threats against him by the CID. The magistrate denied Thomas' request. 

The alleged plot briefly threatened to cause tension between Sri Lanka and its much larger neighbor India, after an Indian newspaper report that Sirisena had accused India's intelligence services of involvement - a claim New Delhi and Colombo have both denied.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States targeted Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency on Tuesday with sanctions against eight individuals, including two linked to the Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
The individuals, who also include two Pakistanis and four Afghans, were designated global terrorists by the Treasury Department, an action that allows the U.S. government to freeze property or interest in property under American jurisdiction.
U.S. sanctions have targeted Taliban members involved in suicide attacks and other lethal activities in Afghanistan, as well as Iranians who provide material and financial support, Treasury said in a statement.
""Iran's provision of military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban is yet another example of Tehran's blatant regional meddling and support for terrorism,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""The United States and our partners will not tolerate the Iranian regime exploiting Afghanistan to further their destabilizing behavior.""
Mnuchin was visiting the Middle East this week to discuss ways to fight terrorist financing and upcoming Iran sanctions. The Taliban sanctions also were imposed by the seven members of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a U.S.-Gulf initiative to stem finance to militant groups.
The U.S. government will continue to target those that provide financial support to the Taliban until there is a negotiated peace settlement, Treasury said.
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on Tuesday added Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and Qassem Soleimani, commander of the guard's Quds Force, to their lists of people and organizations suspected of funding terrorism, the Saudi state news agency SPA said.
The new Taliban-related designations follow a spate of violence in Afghanistan that preceded the country's parliamentary elections last week.
On Thursday, U.S. Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Smiley, was confirmed as one of two Americans wounded in an attack that killed the police chief of the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.
The attack, which the Taliban claimed responsibility for, was a devastating blow to Afghanistan's government, decapitating the security command of one of the country's most strategically important provinces and demonstrating the insurgents' ability to strike even top leaders.

The Quds Force-linked Iranians targeted in the Taliban sanctions were Mohammad Ebrahim Owhadi and Esma'il Razavi, according to the Treasury Department. The others were Abdullah Samad Faroqui, Mohammad Daoud Muzzamil, Abdul Rahim Manan, Hafiz Majid, Sadr Ibrahim and Abdul Aziz. The Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions against Naim Barich, who had been designated in 2012 under international narcotics sanctions.

BOSASSO, Somalia (Reuters) - Fighting between clans in Somalia's breakaway Somaliland region has killed more than 50 people, a witness at the scene and an official in neighboring Puntland said on Tuesday.
""There has been fierce clan fighting yesterday and today. Over 50 people died but they have not been buried because the fighting is still going on,"" Ahmed Ismail told Reuters from Dhumey village.
""The injured are dying of blood loss because there are no hospitals here,"" he said, adding that some had been taken to hospitals further away. 
Dhumey is in an area controlled by Somaliland, but which has been claimed by Puntland for years.
""We understand 51 people died and 120 others were injured in fighting, with clans exchanging heavy weapons fire for the second day,"" Abdullahi Ali Hirsi, interior minister of Puntland, told Reuters.
""It is unfortunate that other clan militias equipped and paid by Somaliland have sided with the two fighting clans. We call for ceasefire and urge the clan elders to stop the war and participate in a peace conference to be held by Puntland.""
Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 and operates as an independent state but has not won international recognition.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Washington is pressing ahead with its plan to quit a nuclear arms control pact, senior U.S. official John Bolton said on Tuesday, signaling that a meeting with Russian leader President Vladimir Putin had not deflected the White House from its plan.
Bolton had a 90-minute meeting in the Kremlin with Putin, at which the Russian leader had taken the White House to task over what he said were a series of unprovoked steps against Moscow.
Russia has said that if U.S. President Donald Trump makes good his threat to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF), Moscow will be forced to respond in kind to restore the military balance.
But speaking at a news conference after his talks with Putin, Bolton, who is national security advisor to Trump, gave no indication of any change of course on the INF treaty.
""There's a new strategic reality out there,"" Bolton said, saying that a Cold War-era treaty no longer met the demands of the world as it is now.
""In terms of filing the formal notice of withdrawal, that has not been filed but it will be filed in due course.""
Earlier, in opening remarks at his meeting with Bolton, Putin had made an acerbic reference to the U.S. coat of arms.
""We barely respond to any of your steps but they keep on coming,"" Putin told Bolton. 
""On the coat of the arms of the United States there's an eagle holding 13 arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other. My question is whether your eagle has gobbled up all the olives leaving only the arrows?"" 
Bolton, who told Putin he hoped to be able to address some of Putin's concerns about the troubled state of U.S.-Russia relations, quipped that he had not brought any olives. 
Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, speaking to reporters after the talks finished, sounded a conciliatory note, saying that Moscow viewed Bolton's visit as a sign Washington wanted to continue dialogue on the issue. He said Moscow wanted the same thing.
Bolton and Putin came to a preliminary agreement that the U.S. and Russian leaders will have a bilateral meeting in Paris on Nov. 11, on the sidelines of events to commemorate the end of World War One. 
Signed by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, the INF treaty required the elimination of all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe. 
Its demise could raise the prospect of a new arms race and of Europe once again hosting U.S. land-based ballistic and cruise missiles. 
Gorbachev, now 87, has warned that unraveling it could have catastrophic consequences. Countries such as Poland have, however, backed Trump's move.

Bolton has said he thinks the treaty is outdated because it does not cover countries such as China, Iran and North Korea which he says remain free to make intermediate-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

Hollywood actress Jolie met with Venezuelan refugees in Lima, Peru this week to draw attention to their plight.
The U.N. has estimated some 2.6 million Venezuelans have left their oil-rich nation, with the majority departing since 2015 amid a crippling economic crisis under President Nicolas Maduro.
""After having spoken to so many people it's clear to me, very clear, that this is not a movement by choice,"" Jolie told reporters in a presentation with Peru's foreign minister.
""I heard stories of people dying because of a lack of medical care and medicine... people starving, and tragic accounts of violence and persecution,"" she said.
Jolie's visit comes amid a backlash against Venezuelans in some South American countries where they have settled.
Peru was one of the first countries to create a special residency program for Venezuelans, allowing them to work legally in the Andean country of 32 million people. But as the number of Venezuelans here has climbed to nearly half a million, Peru has tightened entry requirements, citing security concerns, and cut the residency program short.
Jolie met with Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra and said they discussed ways the international community can help host countries like Peru accommodate Venezuelans.
""As in nearly every displacement crisis, the countries that have fewer resources are being asked to do the most,"" Jolie said, thanking Peru and other ""very generous"" countries like Ecuador and Colombia for hosting displaced Venezuelans.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 01:11PM ET</span>",How the Brexit deal is shaping up,"By Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Even as British Prime Minister Theresa May battles critics in her own party, she may be closing in on a Brexit deal which has been stymied by arguments over the Irish border. Here's how:
IS A DEAL POSSIBLE?
It might be almost done. Negotiators on both sides thought they may have cracked it 10 days ago, EU diplomats told Reuters. The stumbling block seemed to be May calculating that an EU demand for a special ""backstop"" clause for Northern Ireland could not win support from her own party and allies in parliament -- at least not just for the moment.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
Both sides want to avoid a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland -- customs posts that could reignite violence against British rule. Britain says Brexit won't mean physical customs checks. The EU says it might -- and so it wants London to sign a treaty clause that could leave Northern Ireland inside the EU customs space. May and pro-British Belfast allies reject that as dividing the province from the mainland. Instead, May wants the EU to let all of the UK stay in the customs area for a time.
AND THE SOLUTION?
The EU has tried to ramp up assurances that its ""Northern Ireland-only"" backstop will not be triggered. Those assurances had previously been simply that a political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship, due to be agreed this year alongside the withdrawal treaty that would smooth Britain's March exit, would state that a way would be found to avoid customs posts. 
But, EU sources tell Reuters, negotiations this month saw the EU offer to strengthen that idea in the withdrawal treaty itself, bending an EU ""red line"" about pre-empting trade talks as part of an overall package deal to break the deadlock.
They also offered to extend the treaty's transition period, when nothing will change, by a year to the end of 2021 to help ensure that a customs deal is ready to avoid a hard border. There could also be mechanisms to cooperate on any backstop.
BUT THERE'S STILL A HITCH?
There's three.
SNAG ONE
The EU sees May's ""all-UK"" backstop, keeping all of Britain inside the EU customs union, as a dodge to grab unfair advantage by giving a special deal intended for a small, troubled province to Europe's third-biggest economy. It will insist on tough talks after Brexit to limit Britain's access to the EU single market, even if it keeps customs ties that keep Ireland's border open.
SNAG TWO
Brussels still wants a ""Northern Ireland-only"" backstop -- in case trade talks fail. It will play down the risk and may offer special joint mechanisms to oversee how the backstop works. But it's still a problem for May. Her Belfast allies have threatened to vote down her budget next week and there is talk of a party leadership challenge. So she probably needs to wait.
SNAG THREE
The deal effectively keeps Britain in the EU customs union for the foreseeable future. The EU's terms for accepting May's ""all-UK"" solution may prompt accusations she has abandoned a vow to quit the customs union quickly in order to strike trade deals with other countries. EU negotiators, diplomats say, would play along with language to help May deny that it's a customs union -- but she would have a lot of explaining to do on such a deal.
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

Time will tell. EU officials are waiting to see how May can handle her domestic problems and are prepared to have to wait until December for a deal that can then be ratified by both parliaments. Later than that and there will be more talk of a ""no deal"" in which Britain lurches chaotically out on March 29.

Tanga Regional Police Commander Edward Bukombe said the boat went down early on Monday off East Africa's Indian Ocean near Tanzania's maritime border with Kenya.
“Of the people onboard, 12 were Ethiopians and another person, who was the boat captain, (his) nationality has not been identified because he is still missing. Seven people died in the accident and five have been rescued,” Bukombe told Reuters.
He said they were still searching for the missing person.
Bukombe said Tanzania's immigration service was in touch with the Ethiopian Embassy to arrange proper burial arrangements for the dead and decide on how to deal with those rescued at sea. “After questioning the survivors told us that they were going to South Africa,” he said.
Bukombe added that investigators had yet to identify those who had organized and financed the trip, saying the missing captain could have helped much more with the investigation.
He said it was not unusual for Tanzanian police to intercept and detain Ethiopian migrants on their way to South Africa, the continent's largest and most developed economy, though migration was more common overland than by sea.

The press room currently overlooks the palace's central courtyard, letting journalists see visitors coming and going. But soon after Macron took office last year, aides said he would relocate it from within the palace walls to a street nearby.
Journalists said moving the office out of the Elysee would undermine a symbol of transparency, highlighting Macron's preferred communications strategy of using Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to bypass the media.
The press room closure would be ""nothing less than a lock-down of the Elysee and the decision would impinge on reporters' freedom to inform,"" the presidential press association, headed by Reuters reporter Elizabeth Pineau, said in a statement on Tuesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump scrapped a proposal to move news briefings out of the White House earlier last year after journalists and the White House press association objected.
Asked earlier this year about the future of the Elysee press room, Macron told reporters the planned relocation would be part of wider efforts to rearrange Elysee offices amid pressure to cut costs.

His aides said presidential advisers needed a new meeting room and that the new press room, located on a site with less access to presidential activity, would be bigger.

May will make a rare appearance at a meeting of the party's so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers in parliament, where she can expect a rowdy crowd and difficult questions. How she goes down with restive Conservative lawmakers, some of whom would like to topple her, will be closely watched.
With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, Brexit talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
May again failed to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week and her decision to signal the possibility of extending a post-Brexit transition period, keeping Britain under EU governance with no say in it, to help end the deadlock has angered both hardline supporters of Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers.
Britain's Sunday newspapers were full of anonymous attacks on her, the violent nature of which have since been condemned by even her harshest critics. One said May was entering ""the killing zone"", while another said May should ""bring her own noose"" to the 1922 committee meeting.

Two rockets were launched from the Hamas-ruled enclave on Oct. 17. But the group took the unusual step of denying it had carried out an attack. Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said there was reason to believe that was true.
One of the rockets wrecked a house in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba, causing no casualties, the other landed in the Mediterranean Sea. Israel responded with air strikes that killed a militant in Gaza. 
Soon afterwards, video appeared on social media showing lightning illuminating the night sky in Gaza and then two flaming rockets streaking into the air.
Israel's best-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, reported on Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet now believed the lighting set off a launch mechanism.
Asked about the report, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, a member of the security cabinet, told Israel Radio: ""I won't discuss security cabinet meetings and I don't know which ministers are chatting with journalists, but I can say that as far as we know, Hamas did not intend to fire those rockets.""
Hamas officials had no immediate comment.
The rocket launchings coincided with Egyptian efforts to broker a long-term ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, which have fought three wars in the past 10 years.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government on Tuesday approved the exhumation and reburial of the decades-old remains of hundreds of babies left in unmarked graves at the site of a former church-run home for unwed mothers in the western town of Tuam.
Findings last year by an official inquiry that ""significant quantities"" of remains were stored in underground chambers horrified Ireland, reviving anguish over how women and children were once treated at state-backed Catholic institutions.
Almost 800 children could be interred in the grounds, according to a local researcher who first brought the issue to light in 2014 by comparing the number of death certificates issued to recorded burials at the site.
The infant mortality rate at Church-run institutions was significantly higher than in wider Irish society at that time, with death certificates mostly blaming infections like measles, gastroenteritis, bronchitis, tuberculosis and pneumonia.
Relatives have alleged the babies were mistreated because they were born to unmarried women.
""Every effort will be made to locate and recover all juvenile remains from the site,"" Children's Minister Katherine Zappone told a news conference, saying the testimony of relatives who had lost relatives at the home will live with her forever.
""I am committed to ensuring that all the children interred at this site can have a dignified and respectful burial,"" she said. 
Run by nuns from the Bon Secours order, the home operated from 1925 to 1961 and was demolished in the 1970s. Remains dated from between 35 foetal weeks and 3 years of age were found at the site which is now an estate of low-rise, modest homes.
The Church's prestige and authority have been greatly diminished over the past three decades by a series of scandals over pedophile priests, abuse at Magdalene laundries, forced adoptions of illegitimate babies and other painful issues.
During Pope Francis' recent visit to Ireland where he begged forgiveness for the multitude of abuses suffered at the hand of the church, he was handed a letter by Zappone calling for a substantial contribution to the cost of action at the site.
She said on Tuesday that the Vatican had not yet responded but that the Bon Secours order had offered a voluntary contribution of 2.5 million euros towards the estimated 6 to 13 billion euro cost. 
Described as a ""chamber of horrors"" last year by then prime minister Enda Kenny, excavating the site would not be easy, Zaponne said, first requiring legislation and then a phased approach that she was unable to put a timeline on.

She also said that Ireland must prepare itself for ""further truths to come to the fore"" next year when a wider inquiry into the so-called ""mother-and-baby homes"" reports on institutions where tens of thousands of unmarried pregnant women, including rape victims, were sent to give birth.

Journalists asked Macron during a visit to a naval defense show whether France would follow Germany in halting weapons sales to Riyadh after it admitted to the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate.
""This has nothing to do with what we're talking about. Nothing. So I won't answer that question. I'm sorry but as long as I'll be in office this is how it will be, whether people like it or not,"" he told reporters, visibly irritated.
""It's not because one leader says something that I must react to it every time. So I won't answer that,"" he added, after a journalist asked a follow-up question.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called the killing of Khashoggi a ""monstrosity"" and vowed to halt all German arms exports to Riyadh until the case is cleared up.
Her economy minister, Peter Altmaier, called on other European Union member states to follow its example in stopping arms exports to Saudi Arabia to increase pressure on Riyadh over the death of Khashoggi which has caused an international outcry.
Macron has sought to play down the importance of trade relations with Riyadh, saying that Saudi Arabia was not a major client of France.
However, from 2008-17 it was the second-biggest purchaser of French arms, with deals totaling more than 11 billion euros ($12.6 billion) for tanks, armored vehicles, munitions, artillery.

""A big mistake people think this is a lot of money so let me help everyone,"" Laurie Ruckel, a trusts and estates lawyer at Loeb & Loeb law firm in New York, said on Tuesday. ""There are plenty of people who know how to exploit that ignorance.""
Ruckel said the crush of publicity that falls on a lottery winner is something that most people do not usually experience, even those with a high net-worth. She said prize recipients should create a trust and hire a team of lawyers, financial advisers and security. 
The drawing will be held at 11 p.m. ET (0300 GMT Wednesday).
Anyone who hits all six numbers to win the jackpot can choose an immediate cash payment of $904 million or receive the $1.6 billion prize over 29 years. 
Before the last drawing on Friday the jackpot rose by several million dollars. Lottery officials said any increase in the $1.6 billion jackpot would likely occur around midday on Tuesday.
The Mega Millions jackpot, along with a Powerball lottery prize that stands at $620 million, has caused lotto fever to sweep across the United States over the last few days. 
""I'll never win, but you gotta give it a shot,"" Hank Kattan, 75, said in Manhattan on Monday. ""I'd like to change my way of life.""
Mega Millions set a record for lottery jackpots after nobody won the $1 billion prize on Friday. The previous record was a $1.586 billion jackpot for a Powerball drawing in 2016.
Lottery players face odds of 1 in 303 million of winning the Mega Millions drawing. In comparison, the odds of getting killed by a shark are 1 in 3.7 million in a lifetime, according to the International Shark Attack File.
Tickets sold for Tuesday's drawing are expected to cover 75 percent of all possible number combinations, lottery officials said.
Wednesday's Powerball lottery prize stands at $620 million, making it the fifth-largest jackpot in U.S. history, after no one got all six numbers in Saturday's drawing. The lump sum cash payout is estimated at $354.3 million.
The $1.6 billion jackpot, a jaw-dropping amount to the average person who can afford a $2 ticket, is still less than two weeks of profit for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). A $1.5 million investment in  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 1986 would be worth about $1.6 billion today.
If more than one person wins, the jackpots would be divided proportionately, as happened in 2012 with a Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million, a lottery official said.
Mega Millions tickets are sold in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. Several states allow online ticket purchases, but they prohibit out-of-state and foreign purchases.
States receive a percentage of lottery ticket sales and then use the money to support public schools or meet other needs. 

Both lottery jackpots have been increased recently by rule changes that have reduced the chances of winning. The odds of winning Mega Millions were raised a year ago from 1 in 259 million to generate larger prizes.

The Saudi state news agency SPA quoted a statement from the security services saying Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force, and the force's Hamed Abdollahi and Abdul Reza Shahlai were named on the list.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2011 alleged that Soleimani, Abdollahi and Shahlai were linked to a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's former ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, and imposed sanctions on them.
Iran at the time dismissed the accusations as false and demanded an apology from the U.S. government.
The office of the Revolutionary Guards and Iran's foreign ministry were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. The Quds Force is the extraterritorial branch of the Revolutionary Guards.
The SPA also said the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a U.S.-Gulf initiative to stem finance to militant groups, had designated as terrorist-linked several people associated with the Afghan Taliban, some of whom were Iranians.
The center was established in May 2017 during U.S. President Donald Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and the United States co-chair the group and Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also members.

The Trump administration aims to create a security and political alliance with the Sunni Gulf Arab states to counter Shi’ite Iran’s influence in the region, especially in Syria and Iraq.

SHAHAT, Libya (Reuters) - Graffiti covers the ruins of Cyrene in eastern Libya, a city founded by Greeks more than 2,600 years ago that once attracted tourists but is now neglected and the target of vandals.
Insecurity and looting has hit Libya's archaeological sites in the chaos and fighting that has followed the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, as rival groups struggle to consolidate control of the country.
Libya is home to five of UNESCO's World Heritage sites, listed for their outstanding universal value. The sites include the ruins of the Roman city of Leptis Magna and Sabratha, which is famous for its amphitheatre.
There are also prehistoric rock carvings in the Akakous mountains deep in the southern Sahara desert near the border with Algeria.
In the east, tourists once trekked to Cyrene, a site founded by Greeks and later expanded by Romans, nestled in the mountains some 200 km (124 miles) east of Benghazi.
But with foreign tourists gone and the sites visited only by Libyan families on weekend trips, locals have seized land at the sites and vandals have even smeared graffiti on columns and walls.
That presents a challenge to local authorities trying to protect the ruins located in the small community of Shahat.
""In Cyrene, instead of speaking to one owner, now we speak to 50 with different backgrounds,"" said Ahmad Hussein, the head of the antiquities department of a parallel administration in charge of eastern Libya.
""Some of the owners have built houses on these sites,"" he said.
The challenge is worsened by a law in 2013 that allowed people to reclaim land confiscated under Gaddafi. Some people took that literally and annexed what they felt they deserved.
Hussein wants to hold those who seized land accountable.
TWO GOVERNMENTS, FEW VISITORS
The effort to preserve ruins is further hampered by the fact that Libya has two governments. One administration backed by the United Nations sits in Tripoli, while the east has a parallel government.
In a rare positive sign, Hussein said that about 1,700 artifacts had been returned since 2011 after they were looted inside the country. Many other items are smuggled abroad though. 
Leptis Magna in northwestern Libya has been able to escape vandalism thanks to local history fans and relative security at its location near the city of Misrata.
Sabratha has been repeatedly hit by fighting between rival factions and UNESCO last year issued an appeal to protect the site. The site received no help.
In the capital Tripoli, a lone director is trying to preserve some 18 Roman graves, dating back some 1,700 years which were found in 1958 in the western suburb of Janzour.
""There is no support for this site,"" said al-Amari Ramadan Mabrouk, director of the Janzour antiquities office.
Libyan families come occasionally but otherwise spiders and dust cover the graves.

""I cannot give a number for tourists who visit Libya ... but I can say that, before 2011, tourism was popular in Libya,"" he said.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 10:53AM ET</span>",The squadron of ex-military men behind Bolsonaro's rise in Brazil,"By Brad Brooks and Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The man who will likely be Brazil's next Defense Minister greeted two reporters waiting outside the door, then politely sent them packing.
""I do apologize,"" he said, before slipping back into a cramped hotel conference room in the capital of Brasilia. ""On orders from Bolsonaro, it is radio silence until the election is over."" 
The patrician, gray-haired fellow was 70-year-old Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira, a retired four-star Army general. The world may soon be hearing a lot more from him and a cadre of high-ranking ex-military brass now poised to help lead the world's fourth-largest democracy. Their ascension has many here worried about a return to the days when the armed forces called the shots in Brazil. 
Heleno is the dean of a small group of former generals behind the rise of presidential contender Jair Bolsonaro, who is predicted to win easily in this Sunday's election over his leftist opponent Fernando Haddad. A combative far-right former Army captain, Bolsonaro has vowed to crack down on crime, end corruption and steam roll anything in his path.
Most of Bolsonaro's inner circle have retained close ties to Brazil's current military leadership. For example, Antonio Hamilton Mourão, a four-star general who is serving as Bolsonaro's vice presidential running mate, just retired from active duty in February.
High-ranking service members have largely steered clear of politics since Brazil's 21-year dictatorship ended in 1985. But appalling levels of street crime and entrenched government graft have emboldened former military leaders to get involved in the electoral process. While some Brazilians are wary about what they see as encroachment by the military on sacred civilian space, others welcome the change.
""There is an awareness among the public that the military can put this house in order,"" Heleno said earlier this year. ""We are fully aware a coup is not the way forward. The path will be the next election.""
For over a year, Heleno and about a dozen other retired generals and conservative academics, known as the Brasilia Group, have gathered weekly in an unmarked conference room at the Brasilia Imperial Hotel, just two miles west of the presidential palace.
Around a black table littered with stained white porcelain coffee mugs and flanked by 14 burgundy chairs, they have hashed out strategy and tried to hone the rough edges off Bolsonaro, a candidate best known for his homophobic, misogynist and racist outbursts.
In recent interviews with Reuters, Brasilia Group members steered away from granular details about how a potential Bolsonaro administration would govern. 
Instead, they returned consistently to the theme of law and order. Nearly 64,000 people were murdered in Brazil last year, the most in the world. The country is still struggling to shake off the vestiges of an epic corruption scandal that has engulfed the highest levels of government and business.
Many Brazilians are thrilled at the prospect of Bolsonaro taking a firm hand. He won over 49 million votes in the Oct. 7 first-round election, close to the majority that would have avoided the head-to-head runoff with Haddad. 
""Organized crime rules Brazil right now,"" said Kenyson Santos, a 24-year-old retail worker in the capital. ""You think I am worried about the military taking over? Given our reality, they would be a great alternative.""
But plenty of others are alarmed at possible backsliding toward authoritarian rule, even if it comes through the ballot box instead of tanks in the streets.
University of Chicago political scientist Michael Albertus, whose research has focused on Brazil's transition from dictatorship to democracy, said the country ""is in a dangerous moment.""
""(Bolsonaro's) government would give the military carte blanche to do all manner of things,"" Albertus said. ""They will be far more powerful than they have ever been since Brazil transitioned back to a democracy.""
(For a graphic on the ex-military brass in Bolsonaro's inner circle, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NY0TpK) 
ORDER AND PROGRESS?
Bolsonaro has served for nearly three decades in Congress with little distinction. Long dismissed as a gadfly, he has often praised the nation's military regime, which took power in 1964 as part of a coup d’état that toppled a leftist government. 
But explosive events in Brazil over the past five years paved the way for his rise.
In 2013, millions took to the streets in a series of largely spontaneous protests over high taxes, lousy services and the corrupt political class looming over it all.
A tumultuous presidential election the following year split the country. Leftist President Dilma Rousseff narrowly defeated a conservative challenger. Within two years she would be impeached and tossed from office for fudging public accounts. She and her supporters called it a coup. A massive graft investigation known as Operation Car Wash, meanwhile, ensnared scores of business leaders and politicians. A painful recession ravaged the economy. 
Amidst the resulting chaos, Bolsonaro, not tarnished by corruption charges, saw an opening to position himself as a clean candidate who could govern Brazil with rigid discipline, according to members of the Brasilia Group.
Bolsonaro first reached out to retired four-star Army general Oswaldo Ferreira, the former commander of Brazil's Army engineering corps. The two men trained together decades earlier at the Black Needles Military Academy, Brazil's version of West Point.
Ferreira in turn recruited his military mentor Heleno, who in 2004 helped crush criminal gangs in Haiti as the first commander of a United Nations peacekeeping operation. Their network expanded from there.
Bolsonaro is not the only former military man entering politics. One of his confidants, former Army General Paulo Chagas, said he, too, was inspired to run for office out of concern that Brazil is coming apart. This month Chagas failed in his bid to become governor of Brasilia, Brazil's federal district.
But he predicts victory for Bolsonaro, and much misery ahead for ""troublemakers.""
Bolsonaro has advocated more freedom for police to gun down suspected criminals and wants the military to help wipe out drug gangs that control slums in Brazil's largest cities.
Crooked politicians are in the crosshairs, too. Chagas said Bolsonaro, if elected, would deepen corruption investigations that uncovered a sprawling pay-to-play bribery scheme in the nation's public works. 
Wrong-doers ""will pay for the damage they did to the nation,"" he said. 
The tough talk is already having a chilling effect.
More than a dozen government officials and members of civil society groups who spoke with Reuters said they are hearing echoes of the dictatorship. 
""I lived through the regime. In my gut, the atmosphere, the energy in the air, is starting to feel the same,"" said one high-ranking executive branch official, who refused to be named, citing fear of retribution from the likely Bolsonaro government. ""It is the worst possible situation I could imagine.""
CLEANING HOUSE
Back at the Imperial Hotel, two other members of the Brasilia Group - Ferreira and Alessio Ribeiro Souto, who is likely to be the next minister of education - agreed to speak with Reuters outside their War Room.
Dressed in ironed jeans and crisp shirts, the men were courteous and formal, a marked contrast to Bolsonaro's folksy and often offensive slang. They and other group members have worked to temper the firebrand candidate, advising him to speak calmly during press interviews.
Ferreira and Souto emphasized that they were mere technicians working under the orders of Bolsonaro. They said they were not involved in the day-to-day operations of the campaign, rather in figuring out how to execute the strategic vision they were shaping if he is elected.
Ferreira, who retired in 2017, spent his career building roads and bridges for the Army, mainly through the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest to open it to development. He says a priority of a Bolsonaro government would be to finish hundreds of projects that civilian governments have failed to complete.
Souto is a retired three-star general who oversaw the Army's technology center. He said he would urge that creationism be taught in Brazil's schools alongside evolution, part of Bolsonaro's plan to remake schools to please his large base of religious conservatives.
Souto also shares Bolsonaro's view that the nation's school history books should call the 1964-85 period a movement to battle communism, rather than a dictatorship.
This time, change will come through votes, not a military takeover, Souto vowed.
""The only instrument that we know we can now use to obtain peace and harmony is democracy,"" he said. ""And its pillars are liberty, truth, courage and morality.""

608,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Canadian PM says it would be hard to scrap big Saudi arms deal,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, under pressure to punish Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said on Tuesday it would be very hard to scrap an arms deal with Riyadh worth up to $13 billion as critics have demanded.
Trudeau said the 2014 agreement for light armored vehicles, signed by Canada's previous Conservative government and a Canadian unit of U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), had been written in such a way that taxpayers would have to pay a large amount of money to end it.
""The contract signed by the previous government ... makes it very difficult to suspend or leave that contract,"" Trudeau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying his Liberal administration was looking at a number of options.
Trudeau said that ""I do not want to leave Canadians holding a billion-dollar bill because we're trying to move forward on doing the right thing."" Trudeau added that he found it ""incredibly frustrating"" that the terms of the contract with the Saudis meant he could not discuss it in more detail.
The opposition left-leaning New Democrats said on Monday in Parliament that Canada should not be arming the Saudis when they are attacking civilian targets in the war in Yemen. The New Democrats, who will be competing for the same voters as Trudeau in 2019 elections, last week called the Khashoggi matter ""the latest addition in a series of horrible acts by Saudi Arabia.""
Trudeau repeated the government's position that Canada could suspend export permits for the armored vehicles if it determined they had been misused.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called the killing a ""monstrosity"" and vowed to halt German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the case is cleared up.
Trudeau repeated Ottawa's condemnation of the murder of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and critic of the Saudi crown prince who disappeared three weeks ago after entering Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul.
""Countries around the world need to know that there are things they simply cannot do, and killing a journalist who disagrees with the regime is right up there at the top,"" Trudeau said.
Relations between Canada and Riyadh have been tense since a diplomatic dispute over human rights earlier this year. In August, Saudi Arabia froze ties with Ottawa after Canada urged the release of jailed civil rights activists in the kingdom.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:42AM ET</span>",Hundreds of migrant children held in U.S. tent city for months: filings,"By Tom Hals and Kristina Cooke
(Reuters) - U.S. authorities have held some immigrant children who entered the country illegally and without a parent in a temporary ""tent city"" in Texas for months, violating a 20-year-old court order on how long minors can be detained, according to court filings by civil rights lawyers and immigration advocates.
More than 500 children have been housed in tents near Tornillo, Texas since August, and 46 have been held there since June, according to a Friday court filing in Los Angeles federal court by civil rights organizations and advocacy groups representing migrant children. 
The filing opposes a government request to exempt the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which runs the tent city as a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), from oversight by a court-ordered monitor. 
Under the terms of a 1997 court settlement known as the Flores agreement, U.S. authorities must quickly move immigrant children out of prison-like detention centers, either releasing them to guardians or placing them in state-licensed shelters with access to schooling and legal counsel, generally within 20 days. Tornillo is not such a licensed facility. 
The Tornillo tent city was opened in June as a temporary emergency measure as the number of children in ORR custody rose sharply. 
Neither ORR nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to requests for comment. In an Oct. 12 fact sheet, HHS said the temporary shelter was necessary because of the number of unaccompanied minors in its care and so that “the Border Patrol can continue its vital national security mission to prevent illegal migration, trafficking, and protect the borders of the United States.”
The tent city houses no children who were separated from their parents. The facility has 3,800 beds and housed about 1,500 children as of Oct. 12, according to a government fact sheet. 
""None of the children at Tornillo were receiving schooling or regular mental health care, among other benefits to which they would be entitled if they were placed in a licensed shelter,"" said a court filing from Leah Chavla, a human rights lawyer who visited Tornillo on Sept. 24.
The administration of President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central theme of his presidency. 
On Monday the president vowed to reduce or curtail tens of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to three Central American nations, and he called a caravan of migrants bound for the United States a national emergency.
The administration has regularly complained that the Flores settlement has limited its ability to hold illegal immigrants until they can be deported. 
The court filings also show the percentage of children at Tornillo who were released to sponsors ""dropped significantly"" in August from June, according to the court filings.
The Department of Homeland Security said in September it planned to withdraw from Flores.

(The story was refiled to correct the penultimate paragraph to show the percentage of children at Tornillo who were released to sponsors dropped significantly instead of the number dropped significantly.)

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Committee said on Tuesday that France's ban on the niqab, the full-body Islamic veil, was a violation of human rights and called on it to review the legislation.
France had failed to make the case for its ban, the committee said, giving Paris 180 days to report back to say what actions it had taken. The panel's findings are not legally binding but could influence French courts. 
""In particular, the Committee was not persuaded by France’s claim that a ban on face covering was necessary and proportionate from a security standpoint or for attaining the goal of 'living together' in society,"" it said.
The panel of 18 independent experts oversees compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Implementation of its decisions is not mandatory, but under an optional protocol of the treaty, France has an international legal obligation to comply ""in good faith"".
There was no immediate reaction from French authorities.
The same committee came to similar conclusions on the 2008 case of a woman sacked by a creche for wearing a veil. In September, a top French judge was quoted by newspaper Le Monde as saying that while not binding, the panel's decisions might still influence French case law.
RISK OF MARGINALIZATION
In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding, upheld France's ban on full-face veils in public, saying it did not violate religious freedom. 
But the U.N. Human Rights Committee disagreed with this in its statement on Tuesday, saying the ban disproportionately harmed the right of women to manifest their religious beliefs and could lead to them being confined at home and marginalized.
The committee's findings come after complaints by two French women convicted in 2012 under a 2010 law stipulating that ""No one may, in a public space, wear any article of clothing intended to conceal the face."" 
In its findings the panel said the ban had violated the two women's human rights and called on France to pay them compensation. 
Under the ban, anyone wearing the full-face veil in public is liable to a fine of 150 euros or lessons in French citizenship. 
The committee's chair Yuval Shany said that he and several others on the 18-member panel considered it a form of oppression.
Several countries in Europe have introduced legislation on Islamic dress. Denmark's parliament enacted a ban on wearing of face veils in public in May. Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have also imposed some restrictions on full-face veils in public places.
France has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million or more out of a population of 67 million. The place of religion and religious symbols worn in public can be a matter of controversy in the staunchly secular country.

According to French media Metronews, some 223 fines were handed out in 2015 for wearing a full veil in public.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>","Vatican 'suffragettes' want vote, change, in a man's Church","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholic women say there's a clerical stained glass ceiling in the Vatican, and they want to shatter it. 
They want to vote in major policy meetings. They want Pope Francis to deliver on his promise to put more women in senior positions in the Holy See's administration. And some of them say they want to be priests.
""Knock knock! Who's there? More than half the Church!"" several dozen Catholic women chanted outside the Vatican on Oct. 3, the first day of this year's synod of bishops from around the world.
The role of women in the Church has been a recurring theme at the month-long meeting, which brings together some 300 bishops, priests, nuns and lay participants. Only about 35 are women. 
The subject has come up in speeches on the floor, in small group discussions and at news conferences by participants in the gathering, officially titled ""Young People, Faith and Discernment of Vocation"".
Only ""synod fathers"", including bishops and specially appointed or elected male representatives, are allowed to vote on the final recommendations to be sent to the pope, who will take them into consideration when he writes his own document. Other participants are non-voting observers, auditors or experts.
Some of the attendees have pointed to what they say is a contradiction in the rules of the synod, which takes place every few years on a different theme.
This year, two ""brothers"", lay men who are not ordained, are being allowed to vote in their capacity as superiors general of their religious orders. 
But Sister Sally Marie Hodgdon, an American nun who also is not ordained, cannot vote even though she is the superior general of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chambery.
""I am a superior general. I am a sister. So in theory, logically you would think I would have the right to vote,"" Hodgdon, who is also vice president of the International Union of Superiors General (UISG), an umbrella group of Catholic nuns, told reporters.
The membership of female religious orders is about three times larger than that of male orders. 
GENDER IN THE CHURCH
A petition demanding that women have the right to vote at synods has collected 9,000 signatures since it opened online at the start of this meeting. It is sponsored by 10 Catholic lay groups seeking change in the Church, including greater rights for women and gays and a bigger role for the laity. 
""If male religious superiors who are not ordained can vote, then women religious superiors who are also not ordained should vote. With no ontological/doctrinal barrier, the only barrier is the biological sex of the religious superior,"" it reads. 
The cause has won some influential clerical male backers.
At a news conference on Oct. 15, superiors general of three major male religious orders - the Jesuits, the Dominicans and one branch of the Franciscans - expressed support for changes in synod rules in order to allow women to vote in the future.
Backing also came from Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich, president of the German Bishops Conference and one of the most influential Catholic leaders in Europe.
""We must face up to the often uncomfortable and impatient questions of young people about equal rights for women also in the Church,"" Marx said in his speech to the synod.
""The impression that the Church, when it comes to power, is ultimately a male Church must be overcome in the universal Church and also here in the Vatican. It is high time.""
The Holy See, as the offices of the central administration of the 1.3 billion-member Church are known, and the State of Vatican City have a combined work force of about 4,100 people. About 700 are women. 
Of the approximately 60 departments in the Holy See, about 10 must be headed by priests because they deal with governance and jurisdiction over other ordained ministers or other sensitive doctrinal matters, the Church says. 
Francis has promised to put more women in senior roles in those other 50 departments. But more than five years after he was elected, there are only six women in such roles. Five are lay women and one is a nun. None of them heads a department.
Francis told Reuters in June he had to ""fight"" internal resistance to appoint 42-year-old Spanish journalist Paloma Garcia-Ovejero as deputy head of the Vatican's press office.
He declined to name those who had resisted, but said he had to use ""persuasion,"" an apparent reference to the powerful conservative wing of what has been an institution run exclusively by males for 2,000 years.
The Vatican Museums, which are part of the State of Vatican City, are headed by Barbara Jatta, the first woman to hold the high-profile post which oversees nearly 1,000 employees.
The pope's critics, including former Irish President Mary McAleese, say he is moving too slowly.
""How long can the hierarchy sustain the credibility of a God who wants things this way, who wants a Church where women are invisible and voiceless in Church leadership?"" she said at a conference in Rome in March.
TIME FOR CHANGE 
Sister Maria Luisa Berzosa Gonzalez, one of the participants at the current synod, thinks it is time for change - in the synod, and in the wider Church.
The Spanish nun, whose energy belies her 75 years, has dedicated her life to educating the poor and underprivileged in Spain, Argentina and Italy and is still going strong.
""With this structure in the synod, with few women, few young people, nothing will change. It should no longer be this way. Its participation should be broadened,"" she told Reuters.
Berzosa, who took her vows in 1964, said she supports a female priesthood, a position not very common among nuns her age.
The Church teaches that women cannot become priests because Jesus chose only men as his apostles.
Proponents of a female priesthood, like 32-year-old Kate McElwee, who organised the protest on the synod's opening day, say Jesus was merely acting according to the norms of his times.
""Some women feel called by God to be priests. They discern a vocation to the priesthood just as men do,"" said McElwee, the Rome-based executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, a U.S. lobbying group.
McElwee has found kindred spirits in nuns like Berzosa. 
The nun said she knows women won't be priests in her lifetime because change comes slowly and piecemeal in the Church.
Still, between one easy laugh and another, her frustration slipped through.
""I lead spiritual exercises, I develop a deep rapport with people, I teach them how to pray, and then someone else comes along to say the Mass,"" Berzosa said. ""It's not fair.""

CNN Turk did not give further details about the meeting, which two Greek government sources said had been scheduled.
Last week, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the Turkey's navy had stopped a Greek frigate from harassing a Turkish research vessel in the Mediterranean, calling on Greece to ""abstain from acts that would cause an escalation in the region."" 
Greece denied any harassment of the Turkish ship. 
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their respective continental shelves for decades, hampering attempts to explore for hydrocarbons in the Aegean Sea that separates the neighbors.
Former Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, who resigned last week, said on Saturday that Athens planned to extend its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea, to the west of the country. The planned measure would not affect the Aegean region.
As a signatory to the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, Greece says it can extend its territorial waters to 12 miles from the coast from six miles at present, though it has not sought to do so in the waters stretching toward Turkey.

Soros, one of the world's biggest donors to liberal groups and causes, has become a hate figure for right-wing campaigners in the United States and eastern Europe, and the target of a hostile media campaign by the nationalist government in his native Hungary.
An employee at the home in Katonah, New York, opened the package, revealing what appeared to be an explosive device. Soros was not home at the time, the New York Times reported. 
Authorities were contacted at around 3:45 p.m., the Town of Bedford Police Department said in a statement.
Bomb squad technicians detonated the package in a nearby wooded area, police told the newspaper.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Rights group accuses Palestinian Authority, Hamas, of using systematic torture","By Ali Sawafta
RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Security forces of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority and Gaza's rival Hamas group routinely arrest and torture critics and opponents to try to stifle dissent, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday.
Officials of the PA and Hamas denied the allegations of systematic abuse, made by the New York-based rights group, and said they were ready to investigate reports of mistreatment.
In a report, Human Rights Watch said it documented more than two dozen cases of Palestinians detained by the PA or Gaza's ruling Hamas Islamists ""for no clear reason beyond writing a critical article or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posting or belonging to the wrong student group or political movement"".
Palestinian forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza often put detainees into painful stress positions for prolonged periods - a practice similar to that which Israel has inflicted on Palestinians in its custody, the report said.
""The habitual, deliberate, widely known use of torture, using similar tactics over years with no action taken by senior officials in either authority to stop these abuses, make these practices systematic. They also indicate that torture is governmental policy for both the PA and Hamas,"" it said.
In the 25 years since Palestinians gained a degree of self-rule under interim peace deals, ""their authorities have established machineries of repression to crush dissent"", the report added.
In comments to Reuters, Palestinian Authority and Hamas officials denied any pattern of mistreatment.
""We do not have a policy of torture. This is a violation of the law,"" said Eyad Al-Bozom, spokesman of the Hamas-run ministry of interior in Gaza.
""We have taken action against officers who violated the law, including issues of torture. Some were detained and put on trial, others were demoted,"" he said.
Major-General Adnan Al-Dmairi, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority's security forces, said: ""Arrests are being carried according to the law and we are committed to upholding the law.""
The rights group, urging a cut-off of foreign aid to Palestinian security forces in the West Bank, said evidence it collected contradicted contentions that abuse occurred only in isolated cases and that wrongdoers were held to account.
Human Rights Watch said it had met Palestinian intelligence services in the West Bank but was unable to accept a Hamas offer to come to Gaza because Israel refused to grants permits to HRW officials to cross into the enclave.
In May, Israel revoked a work permit issued to Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's local representative, accusing the U.S. national of supporting a boycott against it, an allegation he denied. Shakir challenged the decision in an Israeli court, and the case is continuing.
Hamas, which advocates Israel's destruction, wrested control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.

""As the Fatah-Hamas feud deepened despite attempts at reconciliation, PA security services have targeted supporters of Hamas and vice versa,"" Human Rights Watch said.

MAZATLAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Thousands of people were evacuated, buildings boarded up and classes canceled on Mexico's Pacific coast as Hurricane Willa threatened to batter tourist resorts with high winds and heavy rains on Tuesday.
Residents on Monday night sealed off windows and doors with large wooden planks on hotels facing the historic downtown boardwalk of Mazatlan, a popular coastal city in the state of Sinaloa, as tourists strolled nearby and palm trees swayed in a light breeze. 
Forecast to be one of the most powerful hurricanes to enter Mexico from the Pacific in recent years, Willa is expected to strike a few miles south of Mazatlan as soon as Tuesday afternoon. 
At a gas station on the city's outskirts, a steady line of cars queued up to refuel and shop at the neighboring convenience store. 
Station attendant Zulema Pardo said residents had been streaming through for hours to stock up on basic items, buying enormous jugs of water and gasoline, and leaving the bread shelf completely empty.
    ""People are really scared,"" she said. ""People are crazy and worked up.""
Late on Monday the storm was advancing about 175 miles (280 km) south-southwest of Mazatlan, Mexico, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Several other tourist getaways in Nayarit, as well as the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco state, also lie near the path of the storm, which is forecast to bring a ""life-threatening storm surge, wind and rainfall,"" the NHC said. 
Willa, which was a Category 4 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, was blowing maximum sustained winds of near 130 miles per hour (215 kph) on Monday night with higher gusts, the NHC said.
Headed northward, Willa is forecast to weaken after hitting the coast, the hurricane center said. 
Antonio Echevarria, governor of Nayarit, said more than 10,000 people were being evacuated and schools would be closed. He warned locals not to defy the storm. 
""Let's not play the macho. Let's not act like superheroes,"" he said. ""It's a very strong hurricane, very potent, and we don't want any tragedies.""
Sinaloa also canceled classes in much of the state.
Up to 18 inches (45 cm) of rainfall could pummel the storm zone, the NHC said. Even buildings up to 500 meters (1,640 feet) from the coastline could lose power and suffer physical damage, Mexico's National Meteorological Service (SMN) said.
Despite the looming threat, some tourists appeared unfazed. 
""It doesn't ruin the pleasure of being here,"" said vacationer Angel Avelar, popping open a beer while dangling his feet off the boardwalk. 

""Maybe things will be different tomorrow.""

The carrier has been in service since 2001 but Paris is looking to build a vessel that would take into consideration expected technological advances post-2030 and be capable of carrying a planned new Franco-German fighter jet.
""The Charles de Gaulle will need a successor,"" Florence Parly said in a speech at a defense exhibition in Paris.
""The first step, which starts today, is the study phase to determine what and how we want our future aircraft carrier to be. We have given ourselves 18 months,"" she said.
Three other Western aircraft carriers have been built since the Charles de Gaulle was first deployed. The U.S. Navy's Gerald R. Ford and America, and the British Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth, which cost about 3.1 billion pounds ($4.03 billion). 
Parly said the study will assess the size requirements, propulsion options - both conventional and nuclear - and aircraft-launching capabilities.
A number of French defense firms, ranging from Rafale warplane maker Dassault to systems' contractor Thales, are among companies involved in the study phase. 

The French navy recently completed an 18-month mid-life upgrade of the Charles de Gaulle. Its most recent activity was as part of support operations against Islamic State militants in the Levant region and its battle group is due to return to sea in the first quarter of 2019.

The operation is aimed at giving vulnerable families shelter and stamping out people-trafficking, the regional prefect's office said in a statement. Migrants would be rehoused in shelters in the area and surrounding regions.
President Emmanuel Macron promised earlier this year not to allow another camp to mushroom in nearby Calais, after the previous government dismantled what become known as the ""jungle"" in late 2016.
Police have intervened several times since to forcibly remove people from the Grande-Synthe suburb of Dunkirk, a focal point for migrants for several years and increasingly so since the destruction of the Calais shanty town.

The election was largely procedural as the party had unanimously nominated him as the only candidate for the position earlier this month.
Trong, 74, became the first Vietnamese leader to hold the two titles since founding president and revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.

Hundreds of thousands of Iranians travel to the Iraqi city of Kerbala each year for the ritual of Arbaeen, which marks the end of a 40-day mourning period for the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, Imam Hussein.
Iran's Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, visiting the Iran-Iraq border area, was quoted by state television as saying that ""three terrorist groups that wanted to target Arbaeen mourners were arrested.""
Tasnim news agency quoted Alavi as saying the arrests took place in southwestern Khuzestan province in recent days, and 15 people were arrested.
""The detainees confessed that they wanted to carry out suicide attacks to kill the pilgrims,"" Alavi said.
He gave no indication when the attacks were due to take place, but the culmination of the pilgrimage this year falls at the end of October.
Shi'ites are considered apostates by hardline Sunni Islamist insurgents in Iraq. Armed Sunni groups in Iran have also increased attacks on military and civilian targets in recent months.
Iran stepped up security in border areas after five gunmen killed 25 people at a military parade in the city of Ahvaz, in Khuzestan province, in September. 
Islamic State militants and an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement claimed responsibility for the attack, but neither claim provided convincing evidence. 
At least 10 Iranian security personnel including Revolutionary Guards were kidnapped on the border with Pakistan last week. A Sunni separatist group said it had seized them as revenge for the oppression of Sunni Muslims.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan touched down in Fiji on Tuesday for the first royal visit to the South Pacific nation since a military coup 12 years ago saw it suspended from the Commonwealth for eight years until democratic elections.
Hundreds of spectators waved small plastic Fijian and British flags as Harry, wearing a gray suit with three medals, and Meghan, dressed in a cream long-sleeved dress and matching hat, stepped on to the tarmac outside the capital of Suva.
""Regardless of the drizzling rain, Fijians are out in numbers with their umbrellas to welcome their royal highnesses,"" the Fiji government said on social network Twitter, alongside pictures of crowds waiting to greet the couple. 
Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama received the couple, who were presented with a bouquet of tropical flowers before the inspection of an honor guard standing to attention in red and white military uniforms.
Thousands of men, women and school children lined the route of the couple's official motorcade into central Suva, with many spectators smiling, waving and holding up handwritten signs.
""Welcome to Fiji, Prince and Princess,"" read one that appeared to have been written on an old carton. 
Harry and Meghan will be feted in a ceremony at a park in Suva, mirroring a welcome for Queen Elizabeth in 1953. Men in traditional skirts with garlands of leaves and flowers lined up waiting to perform a ceremony. 
The former British colony of 300 tropical islands, with a population of about 910,000, was suspended from the British Commonwealth and isolated internationally after Bainimarama, then army commander, seized power in a bloodless coup in 2006.
Although it was reinstated in 2014, after Bainimarama won democratic elections, mending Commonwealth ties has taken a long time, while Fiji has deepened relations with strategic rivals such as China.
Before Tuesday, the last British royal visit to the island was by Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth's daughter, in July 2006. 
The couple, who married in May and announced last week that they were expecting a child, next travel to Tonga and return to Australia for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games before wrapping up their tour in New Zealand.

Fiji is due to hold elections on Nov. 14, with Bainimarama's Fiji First party favored to win over an opposition led by Sitiveni Rabuka, who himself led the country's first military coup in 1987.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge is made up of nearly 35-km (22-mile) of bridge and road sections, and a 6.7 km (4-mile) tunnel between artificial islands to allow shipping to pass unhindered.
President Xi Jinping presided over the inauguration early on Tuesday but said little except to declare the bridge officially open to a burst of fireworks projected onto a screen behind him. 
Vice premier Han Zheng said the bridge would help drive China's strategic blueprint for a ""Greater Bay Area"" around the Pearl River Delta modeled on other global economic dynamos like San Francisco Bay and Tokyo Bay.
""Standing at this new historical starting point, we firmly believe that the opening of the bridge will further develop the special advantage of Hong Kong and Macau,"" Han said in a speech at the ceremony.
Graphic showing Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge - http://tmsnrt.rs/2pZ0YNU
The bridge, which snakes across the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong's Lantau island and passes Macau's glitzy casinos, will begin operations on Wednesday when some bus services begin.
Arrangements are being finalised for trucks and private vehicles will need special permits to use it.
According to Chinese media, authorities will use facial recognition systems to detect yawning drivers on the bridge, as a safety measure. If a driver yawns three times, an alarm will go off, media has reported.
Hong Kong authorities have defended the bridge's HK$120 billion ($15.31 billion) price tag, saying it would consolidate Hong Kong's position as a regional aviation and logistics hub. 
Some critics, however, see the bridge as a white elephant that is part of a multi-pronged push by China to exert greater control over Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises to preserve the city's high degree of autonomy and individual freedoms denied in mainland China.
The bridge was first proposed in the late 1980s, but it was opposed at the time by Hong Kong’s British colonial government, which was wary of development that might draw the city closer to Communist China. 
TROUBLED WATERS
The bridge's opening comes at a challenging time for China as it faces pressure from a trade war with the United States, volatile financial markets, mounting public debt and a slowing economy.
President Xi's visit to the southern economic powerhouse of Guangdong had been shrouded in secrecy, with state media making little mention of his itinerary before he showed up for the bridge opening.
Some media commentators have seen Xi's trip to Guangdong as an opportunity for Beijing to reaffirm its commitment to economic liberalization. 
Some point to the apparent symbolism of his visit to the crucible of China's boom on the 40th anniversary of the launch of its reforms, when it began a transformation from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy with Chinese characteristics.
Xi has come under fire from some businessmen and analysts for his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability, rather than proactively pushing market liberalization.
He said last month, however, that China was still determined to reform and wanted to work with all parties to build an open world economy. 
He said on Sunday the ruling Communist Party would always support private firms' development, and any acts to weaken the private economy were wrong, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Some Hong Kong media have dubbed Xi's trip, his second to Guangdong since taking office in 2012, as a ""southern tour"", echoing a high-profile 1992 visit to the special economic zones of the south by former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Deng's trip helped reaffirm China's commitment to reform after the international condemnation following the 1989 killings of protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ).
A senior Western diplomat said Xi's southern tour was an opportunity for him to say something significant on economic and market reforms, and to re-affirm Deng's legacy, noting that Xi had displayed ""very little evidence of that"" in recent years.

A vehicle packed with explosives was parked near a restaurant and a crowded market area in Qayyara, south of the city of Mosul, police said. Health official said the death toll might rise as some of the wounded were in a critical condition.
No group immediately claimed responsibility, but Islamic State militants often carry out such attacks.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, dislodging the group from all territories it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also composed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017.
The group's fighters have since waged a campaign of kidnapping, killing and bomb attacks targeting civilians and security forces.
An interior ministry spokesman said the blast was a result of a “terrorist attack by a car bomb”.

More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh last year, according to U.N. agencies, following a counter-insurgency operation launched by Myanmar's military after attacks on security posts by Rohingya militants in August last year.
A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar's military of gang rapes and mass killings with ""genocidal intent"" and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report, blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.
However Australia, which has previously provided training for Myanmar's army and refrained from imposing sanctions, on Tuesday responded to the U.N. report by targeting four of the men named, and one other senior commander.
""I have now imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against five Myanmar military officers responsible for human rights violations committed by units under their command,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.
A separate document named the officers; Aung Kyaw Zaw, Aung Aung, Maung Maung Soe, Than Oo and Khin Maung Soe. It said financial dealings with them can now attract penalties of A$1.7 million ($1.2 million) for companies and 10 years jail for individuals. 
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not pick up a call seeking comment on Tuesday.
The United States imposed similar restrictions on top generals in August. Like the United States, Australia omitted Myanmar's military chief, Min Aung Hlaing from the sanctions. 
The European Union imposed similar restrictions in June.

The train came off the rails on Sunday on a curve while moving at almost 87 miles per hour (140 kmh), nearly twice the speed limit of 46 mph (74 kmh), in the island's mountainous northeast, the head of a government investigation team said.
Chief investigator Wu Ze-cheng told Reuters earlier it was not clear whether the speed-control system, called automatic train protection, had switched off by itself or had been manually disabled before the accident, which also injured 187 people.
A spokesman for Taiwan Yilan District Court told Reuters the driver told his bail hearing he switched off the system himself to boost the train's power when it had slowed down on an earlier stretch of the journey.
""He should have turned the system back on at the next stop,"" said the court spokesman, Huang Yong-sheng.
""The defendant is highly suspected to have been negligent."" 
Reuters was not able to reach the train driver, You Zhen-zhong, 48, for comment. He was granted bail of T$500,000 ($16,167) and barred from leaving Taiwan after being detained for the investigation. 
You had been treated in hospital after the accident.
You's public defender, Kou Tua-jai, said the driver knew he had to turn the protection system back on, but he had failed to do so because he was busy communicating with other coordinators due to a separate problem with the train's speed.
""He admitted that he's responsible for dereliction of duty, but he’d like to raise one point: there was something wrong with the train,"" Kou told Reuters. 
Kou said the driver said the speed shown on the train's indicator was not its real speed.
Chief investigator Wu said more investigation was needed to determine why the driver failed to turn the protection system back on.
He said it was not immediately clear if the speed shown on the train's indicator was different to its actual speed.

The disaster was Taiwan's deadliest rail accident since a 1981 collision that killed 30 people.
The head of the state railway administration, Lu Jie-shen, had offered to resign but that was not accepted by the transport minister, the railway authority said.
Premier William Lai apologized for the accident on behalf of the government.
""People expected the railway to be the safest,"" Lai told parliament.
""I apologize to the people on behalf of the Executive Yuan,"" he said, referring to the island's cabinet.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian opposition lawmakers have offered a deal to resettle 150 refugees from a Pacific detention camp, which if accepted by embattled Prime Minister Scott Morrison could strengthen his tenuous grip on power.
Morrison's government is on the verge of losing its majority, after a devastating by-election on Saturday, and key independents have warned their support hinges on him freeing children from the Australian-run detention camp on Nauru island.
The Australian government has steadfastly refused to allow any refugees arriving by boat to enter the country, instead detaining them in remote Pacific detention centers.
Nearly 1,300 asylum seekers have been detained in Papua New Guinea and Nauru for more than five years after being intercepted while trying to travel to Australia by boat.
New Zealand has offered to resettle 150 refugees, a proposal Canberra has previously said it would only accept if opposition lawmakers agreed to change the law to prevent any refugee from ever traveling to Australia in future.
Amid warnings by aid agencies of a health crisis on Nauru, the opposition Australian Labor Party said it would agree to a compromise amendment which would only ban refugees sent to New Zealand.
""Labor is prepared to compromise with the government,"" deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek told reporters in Canberra.
""We understand that it is beyond time that these people who have been reported by their doctors and other support workers to be in the most desperate circumstances, find a new home.""
Morrison said he would consider the compromise.
Eleven child migrants were transferred from Nauru to Australia for medical treatment on Monday, only hours after two independents said they would only support the government if it stopped detaining children.
Morrison is poised to lose his one-seat parliamentary majority after voters, angry about the party's ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, deserted the ruling Liberal Party in a Sydney by-election. 
Turnbull was the sitting member for the Sydney seat and quit politics after being dumped.
Although counting continues, Morrison is likely to have to rely on the support of five independents to prevent a no confidence motion that could trigger an election. The next general election is due by May 2019. 
Two independents have said their support is conditional on the immediate resettlement of 52 children detained on Nauru.
Human rights groups warn all refugees on PNG and Nauru are in need of resettlement as a controversial resettlement deal with the United States stalls.
In 2016 Australia and the United States agreed to a refugee swap which would see Australia take people from Latin America and in return the United States would take up to 1,250 refugees held in the Australian camps. Two years on, only 422 refugees have been given U.S. resettlement.
""Lives are at risk,"" said Catherine Stubberfield, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.

""They need to step in now and make sure that further harm and even deaths are not occurring.""

643,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 08:18PM ET</span>",Trump threatens to cut Central America aid over migrant caravan,"By Makini Brice and Delphine Schrank
WASHINGTON/TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday vowed to begin curtailing millions of dollars in American aid to three Central American nations and called a caravan of migrants bound for the United States a national emergency, as he sought to boost his party's chances in Nov. 6 congressional elections.
""Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them,"" Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts.
The caravan, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands, is in southern Mexico, inching toward the distant U.S. border. 
Trump and his fellow Republicans have sought to make the caravan and immigration campaign issues ahead of the midterm elections, in which his party is fighting to maintain control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
""Remember the Midterms!"" Trump tweeted. 
Trump's remarks also seemed aimed at piling pressure on Mexico to stop the caravan, something that he complained the Mexican police and military had failed to do.
Mexico, which has refused Trump's demands that it pay for a border wall between the countries, tries to walk a fine line between showing solidarity with the Central American migrants and responding to Washington's demands to control its borders.
The caravan was moving north again on Monday as migrants left the southern Mexican city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border, bound for the town of Huixtla, also in Chiapas state.
Some shielded themselves from the midday sun with umbrellas, others with bits of cardboard on which they had slept the previous night. As they left the city and crossed a highway, Mexican drivers honked their horns in support. 
U.S. administrations have long seen aid programs as an essential part of efforts to stabilize the countries of Central America and stem the flow of migrants leaving. 
But since Trump became president last year, the United States has already moved to sharply decrease aid to the region.
In 2016, the United States provided some $131 million in aid to Guatemala, $98 million to Honduras, and $68 million to El Salvador, according to U.S. data. By next year, those sums were projected to fall to $69 million for Guatemala, $66 million for Honduras and $46 million for El Salvador - a reduction of almost 40 percent for the three nations.
Later on Monday, Trump headed to Texas, a key border state, to campaign for Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who is seeking re-election.
Speaking to reporters, Trump stepped up his criticism, saying that despite getting a ""tremendous amount of money"" in U.S. foreign aid, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ""like a lot of others, do nothing for our country."" 
Trump also said, without providing evidence, that ""Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"" are mixed in with the caravan, a claim immigration advocates disputed.
'POWER OF THE PURSE'
Democratic Representative Nita Lowey said Trump's threat to cut foreign aid ""ignores that Congress, not the president, is entrusted by the Constitution with the power of the purse."" Lowey said Congress provides assistance to Central American countries to address the root causes of why people want to leave in the first place.
""Cutting funding would make the problem worse, not better,"" Lowey added in a statement.
The migrants - men, women and children - have defied threats by Trump that he will close the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as Mexican government warnings.
Argelia Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the caravan, said there were about 10,000 people in the group and that around 6,000 of them would seek to remain in Mexico. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq estimated the caravan includes more than 7,000 people.
""Donald Trump can say what he wants. At the end of the day, he knows he's not the king of the world,"" Ramirez told Reuters. ""We're fighting for a cause, and I think God will end up moving the hearts of all the American people.""
The caravan is still a long way - more than 1,100 miles (1,800 km) - from the U.S. border. Mexico hopes to disperse the convoy long before it can reach the border using bureaucratic procedures, telling migrants to register with authorities in order to submit applications for asylum in Mexico.
That process can last weeks, and migrants are supposed to stay where they register while applications are processed. If they violate those rules, they face deportation.
Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete told a media briefing on Monday that 1,128 Hondurans had sought refugee status in Mexico. He said 82,166 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador had been returned to their homelands in 2018.
He did not give a clear answer when asked if federal police would accompany the migrants to the U.S. border or stop them. Officers had instructions to keep watch over the caravan and help the national migration agency, Navarrete said. He did not provide further details of how the police would be deployed. 
Separately, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told a business summit that those in the caravan who did not follow the rules were unlikely to be able to remain in Mexico or reach the United States.
A spokesman for the president's office in El Salvador, Roberto Lorenzana, said the country had slashed migration to the United States by 60 percent over the past few years, a feat its Central American neighbors had not matched.
In Guatemala, a border crossing with Mexico and another with Honduras have been closed indefinitely, said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for that country's migration agency.

Army Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that while National Guard troops are currently supporting the Department of Homeland Security on the border, the Pentagon had not been asked to provide additional support. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops along the border in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, according to the Pentagon.

644,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Trump Says He’s ‘Not Satisfied’ as Mnuchin Meets Saudi Prince,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s still not satisfied with Saudi Arabia’s explanation of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s death as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
Trump, speaking to reporters Monday on the White House lawn before leaving for a rally in Houston, said he had spoken with the Prince Mohammed and is awaiting findings from the “tremendously talented people” dispatched to Turkey and Saudi Arabia who were due to return to the U.S. within the next day to brief him on their findings.
“I will know very soon” what happened to Khashoggi, Trump said. “I am not satisfied with what I’ve heard.” Trump didn’t elaborate on his conversation with Prince Mohammed, nor did he say which agency is investigating Khashoggi’s death or what they are examining.
Meanwhile, Mnuchin met with Prince Mohammed on Monday to discuss the unfolding Khashoggi investigation, as well as combating terrorist financing, sanctions against Iran and Saudi economic issues, Treasury spokesman Tony Sayegh said on Twitter.
Following the meeting, the Saudi foreign ministry tweeted a photo of the two seated beside each other: “#Crown Prince meets with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and stresses the importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom’s #Vision2030,” referring to a Prince Mohammed’s plan to attract foreign investment.

— Foreign Ministry (@KSAmofaEN) October 22, 2018
Mnuchin proceeded with the meeting even as government leaders and corporate executives in Europe and around the world distanced themselves from the Saudi regime amid outrage over the killing. Trump is preparing to tighten oil sanctions on Iran and the administration is counting Saudi cooperation to make up for the loss of supply and soften potential price increases.
Mnuchin is in the Middle East for a previously planned trip to the region.
The Saudi government admitted late Friday that the dissident writer had died after what they said was a fight within the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, where he sought to obtain a document related to his planned wedding. Turkish media and officials have said the Washington Post contributor, a critic of the royal family, was killed and dismembered by a 15-man team that flew in from the kingdom for the day.
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said the White House is still gathering facts on Khashoggi’s murder and wants to preserve the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia, downplaying the role of the kingdom’s government in the death.
“I see things that are deceptive every day,” he said Monday at a CNN event in New York after he was asked if the Saudi government had been deceptive about Khashoggi’s death in its Istanbul consulate. “I see them in the Middle East, I see them in Washington.”
“We have our eyes wide open,” he added.
Kushner has developed a personal relationship with Prince Mohammed, who some Republican senators have said is responsible, directly or not, for Khashoggi’s death.
Kushner said he had advised Prince Mohammed to be “transparent” about the incident. Asked whether the administration is reassessing the crown prince as an ally, Kushner said that “once we have all the facts then we’ll make an assessment.”
“Right now as an administration we’re more in the fact-finding phase and we’re obviously getting as many facts as we can from the different places,” Kushner said. “We have to be able to work with our allies, and Saudi Arabia has I think been a very strong ally.”
He said the kingdom has helped the U.S. combat Iranian influence in the Mideast. Saudi Arabia and Iran are engaged in what amounts to a proxy war in Yemen, where they are supporting opposing sides in a bloody civil war. The kingdom has come under criticism for civilian deaths from its bombing campaign in the country.

The two men who were taken into custody were Adnan Gheith, who holds the largely ceremonial post of Palestinian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, and Jihad Al-Faqeeh, the head of Palestinian intelligence in the city.
They were arrested on suspicion of aiding the abduction a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, their lawyers said.
Gheith's lawyer, Mohammed Mahmoud, said his client was ordered to stay away from Jerusalem, remain in home detention for seven days and pay a 20,000 shekel ($5,500) fine.
The official Palestinian news agency, WAFA, said President Mahmoud Abbas had spoken by phone to both men following their release.
According to a report on Israel's Reshet 13 television, the Palestinian resident of Jerusalem abducted two weeks ago has both an Israeli identity card and U.S. citizenship.

The League's junior health minister Maurizio Fugatti was elected provincial governor on Monday with almost 47 percent of the vote, backed by a coalition including Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and local civic lists. 
The League, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, garnered more than 27 percent, almost twice as much as the center-left Democratic Party and quadrupling its vote at the previous regional election in 2013.
The League, which won 17 percent of the vote at a national election in March, has seen its popularity surge on the back of a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration, and is now Italy's leading party with more than 30 percent, according to opinion polls.
Trento is one of the two provinces in the region of Trentino Alto Adige, which enjoys autonomous legislative and administrative powers that give it a significant degree of independence from the central government.
In German-speaking Alto Adige, the region's other province, the Südtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) - a local party which normally governs with the center left - led the way with almost 42 percent of the vote. The League got 11 percent.
The SVP is now widely expected to govern Trentino Alto Adige with the League.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 03:09PM ET</span>",How the man behind Khashoggi murder ran the killing via Skype,"(Reuters) - He ran social media for Saudi Arabia's crown prince. He masterminded the arrest of hundreds of his country's elite. He detained a Lebanese prime minister. And, according to two intelligence sources, he ran journalist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by giving orders over Skype.
Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is one of the fall guys as Riyadh tries to stem international outrage at Khashoggi’s death. On Saturday, Saudi state media said King Salman had sacked Qahtani and four other officials over the killing carried out by a 15-man hit team.
But Qahtani's influence in the crown prince's entourage has been so vast over the past three years - his own rise tracking that of his boss - that it will be hard for Saudi officials to paint Qahtani as the mastermind of the murder without also raising questions about the involvement of Prince Mohammed, according to several sources with links to the royal court.
""This episode won't topple MbS, but it has hit his image which will take a long time to be repaired if it ever does. The king is protecting him,"" one of the sources with ties to the royal court said.
Qahtani himself once said he would never do anything without his boss' approval.
""Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the king and my lord the faithful crown prince,"" Qahtani tweeted last summer.
Qahtani did not respond to questions from Reuters. His biography on Twitter changed in recent days from royal adviser to chairman of the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones, a role he had held before.
Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the operation that led to Khashoggi's death and ""certainly did not order a kidnapping or murder of anybody"", a Saudi official said on Saturday. Officials in Riyadh could not be reached for further comment.
As the crisis has grown over the past three weeks, Saudi Arabia has changed its tune on Khashoggi's fate, first denying his death, then saying he died during a brawl at the consulate, and now attributing the death to a chokehold.
A senior Saudi official told Reuters that the killers had tried to cover up what happened, contending that the truth was only now emerging. The Turks reject that version of the story, saying they have audio recordings of what happened.
The kingdom has survived other crises in the past year, including the fallout of the crown prince's short-lived kidnapping of Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri in 2017. Hariri, too, was verbally humiliated and beaten, according to eight Saudi, Arab and Western diplomatic sources. The man leading that interrogation: Saud al-Qahtani.
France intervened to free Hariri, but Western capitals did not take Riyadh to task for detaining a head of government - and Prince Mohammed emerged emboldened, according to these Saudi sources.
This time is different, with some Western capitals increasingly critical of the murder and the Saudi explanation.
Germany has announced it will stop arms sales, while Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement asking for an ""urgent … clarification of exactly what happened Oct 2.""
President Donald Trump has swung between saying he is unhappy with the Saudi investigation but also that he does not want to jeopardize U.S. arms sales to the country.
SKYPE CALL
To stem the fallout of the Khashoggi killing, the crown prince, commonly known by his initials MbS, allowed Qahtani to take the fall, according to one source close to the Saudi royal court. 
A second senior Saudi official said Qahtani had been detained following his sacking by royal decree, but he continued to tweet afterwards. The sources with links to the royal court said he was not believed to be under arrest.
In the Khashoggi killing, Qahtani was present as he has been in other key moments of MbS's administration. This time, though, his presence was virtual.
Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi journalist often critical of Saudi Arabia and its leadership, walked into the Istanbul consulate at around 1 pm on Oct 2, to pick up some documents that would allow him to marry. 
Turkish security sources say he was immediately seized inside the consulate by 15 Saudi intelligence operatives who had flown in on two jets just hours before.
According to one high-ranking Arab source with access to intelligence and links to members of Saudi Arabia’s royal court, Qahtani was beamed into a room of the Saudi consulate via Skype.
He began to hurl insults at Khashoggi over the phone. According to the Arab and Turkish sources, Khashoggi answered Qahtani’s insults with his own. But he was no match for the squad, which included top security and intelligence operatives, some with direct links to the royal court.
A Turkish intelligence source relayed that at one point Qahtani told his men to dispose of Khashoggi. ""Bring me the head of the dog"", the Turkish intelligence source says Qahtani instructed. 
It is not clear if Qahtani watched the entire proceedings, which the high-ranking Arab source described as a ""bungled and botched operation"".
The Arab source and the Turkish intelligence source said the audio of the Skype call is now in the possession of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The sources say he is refusing to release it to the Americans.
Erdogan said on Sunday he would release information about the Turkish investigation during a weekly speech on Tuesday. Three Turkish officials reached by Reuters declined to comment ahead of that speech.
The senior Saudi official who laid out the official version of events – that Khashoggi had got into a fight – said he had not heard about Qahtani appearing via Skype, but that the Saudi investigation was ongoing.
QAHTANI’S RISE
Qahtani, 40, has earned a reputation at home as both a violent enforcer of princely whims and as a strident nationalist. In blogs and on social media, some liberal Saudi journalists and activists dubbed him the Saudi Steve Bannon for his aggressive manipulation of the news media and behind-the-scenes strategizing.
Qahtani wrote odes on Twitter to the royal family under the pen name Dari, which means predator in Arabic. Some of his opponents on social media call him Dalim, a figure in Arabic folklore who rose from being a lowly servant to much greater heights.
According to his biography on his Twitter account, Qahtani studied law and made the rank of captain in the Saudi air force. After launching a blog, he caught the eye of Khaled al-Tuwaijri, the former head of the royal court, who hired him in the early 2000s to run an electronic media army tasked with protecting Saudi Arabia’s image , according to a source with ties to the royal court.
Tuwaijri is under house arrest and could not be reached for comment.
Qahtani rose to further prominence after latching onto Prince Mohammed, who was part of his father Salman's court as Riyadh governor, then crown prince and finally king in 2015
Tasked with countering alleged Qatari influence on social media, Qahtani used Twitter to attack criticism of the kingdom in general and Prince Mohammed in particular. He also ran a WhatsApp group with local newspaper editors and prominent journalists, dictating the royal court’s line.
When Riyadh led an economic boycott against Qatar in June 2017, Qahtani ramped up his attacks on the small Gulf state. Online, he urged Saudis to tweet the names of anyone showing sympathy with Qatar under the Arabic hashtag ""The Black List"".
The high-ranking Arab official and Saudi sources with ties to the royal court said Qahtani was MbS's ""bad cop"" late last year when 200 people, including Saudi princes, ministers and business tycoons, were detained and put under house arrest at the Ritz Carlton in an anti-corruption sweep. Qahtani oversaw some of the interrogations, the Arab official said.
A KIDNAPPING
The extent of Qahtani’s power is perhaps best illustrated by the kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri last year, several of the Saudi and Arab diplomatic sources said.
The Saudis were incensed at the inability of Hariri, a Sunni Muslim and a Saudi client, to stand up to their regional rival Iran and Hezbollah, the Shi'ite paramilitary movement that acts as Tehran’s spearhead in the region. Hariri belonged to the same multi-party coalition government as Hezbollah.
The Saudis were particularly dismayed that Hariri had failed to deliver a message to a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to stop interfering in Lebanon and Yemen. Hariri claimed he had delivered the Saudi message, but an informer, planted by Qahtani in Hariri's circle, gave the Saudis the minutes of the meeting which showed that he had not done so.
The Saudis lured Hariri to Riyadh for a meeting with MbS. Upon his arrival on Nov. 3, 2017, there was no line-up of Saudi princes or officials, as would typically greet a prime minister on an official visit. Hariri later received a call that the meeting with the crown prince would take place the next day at a royal compound.
When Hariri arrived, he was ushered into a room where Qahtani was waiting for him with a security team, according to three Arab sources familiar with the incident. The security team beat Hariri; Qahtani cursed at him and then forced him to resign as prime minister in a statement that was broadcast by a Saudi-owned TV channel.
""He (Qahtani) told him you have no choice but to resign and read this statement,"" said one of the sources. ""Qahtani oversaw the interrogation and ill-treatment of Hariri.""
Another source said it was the intervention of French President Emmanuel Macron that secured his release following an international outcry.
Macron claimed credit in May for ending the crisis, saying an unscheduled stopover in Riyadh to convince MbS, followed by an invitation to Hariri to come to France, had been the catalyst to resolving it. Lebanese officials confirmed to Reuters that Macron's quick intervention secured Hariri's return.
Saudi officials could not be reached for comment about the sequence of events or Qahtani's involvement. French officials declined to comment when asked about Qahtani's role.
AN OFFER TO RETURN HOME
At least three friends of Khashoggi told Reuters that in the months after the journalist moved to Washington a year ago he received multiple phone calls from MbS’s right-hand man urging him to return to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi had balked, they said, fearing reprisals for his Washington Post columns and outspoken views.
Qahtani had tried to reassure the former newspaper editor that he was still well respected and had offered the journalist a job as a consultant at the royal court, the friends said.
Khashoggi said that while he found Qahtani gentle and polite during those conversations, he did not trust him, one close friend told Reuters. ""Jamal told me afterwards, 'he thinks that I will go back so that he can throw me in jail?"" 
The second senior Saudi official confirmed that Qahtani had spoken to Khashoggi about returning home. The ambush in Istanbul seems to have been another way to get him home.
How much did the crown prince know about his trusted aide’s plan to abduct Khashoggi? 
Most of the 15 hit-man team identified by Turkish and Saudi authorities worked for the kingdom's security and intelligence services, military, government ministries, royal court security and air force. One of them, General Maher Mutreb, a senior intelligence officer, who is part of the security team of Prince Mohammed, appeared in photographs with him on official visits earlier this year to the United States and Europe.
The high-ranking Arab official and the Turkish intelligence source said it was Mutreb's phone that was used to dial in Qahtani while Khashoggi was being interrogated. 
Reuters tried to contact members of 15-man team but their phones were either switched off, on voicemail or no longer in service.
The Saudi official said Deputy Intelligence Chief General Ahmed al-Asiri put together the 15-man squad from the intelligence and security forces. Asiri was one of the five officials dismissed on Saturday.
Another key figure was Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic expert specialized in autopsies attached to the Saudi Ministry of Interior. His presence – equipped with a bone-saw Turkish sources say was used to dismember the journalist – is hard to explain in an operation Saudi officials now say was aimed at persuading Khashoggi to return home.
It is hard to imagine that the crown prince could have not known about such a delicate operation, the Saudi sources with ties to the royal court say.
The Saudi official who spoke on Saturday said an existing standing order provided authorization to ""negotiate"" with dissidents to return home without requiring approval, but that the team involved with Khashoggi exceeded that authorization.
Another Saudi official close to the investigation said that Qahtani decided on his own to organize Khashoggi’s kidnapping and that he asked Asiri to get a team together, but that their plans had gone wrong.
Qahtani's final act may be to serve his boss by assuming the responsibility for the crisis that has hit Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi's murder. The Saudi king has sacked Qahtani and ordered a restructuring of the general intelligence agency. 

To head it, he named MbS.

""A coalition strike destroyed several buildings used by Daesh to launch attacks...One of those facilities used by Daesh was a mosque that was being used as a defensive fighting position and command center,"" a statement from the coalition said, using an Arabic-language acronym for Islamic State.
""The strike killed several Daesh as they were actively firing on coalition partner forces, which eliminated another Daesh capability from the battlefield,"" the statement added. 
The strike took place in As Susah, Syria. 
On Sunday, the coalition said it had killed militants in eastern Syria by striking a mosque that Islamic State used as a base.
The United States has led an international coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State since 2014. U.S. troops have served as advisers on the ground with Iraqi government forces and with Kurdish and Arab groups in Syria.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes killed 41 people, including 10 children, in eastern Syria and its environs on Thursday and Friday. Many were Iraqi relatives of Islamic State fighters, the UK-based monitor said.
However, the coalition said the strike on Thursday killed 12 militants, disabling a command center they had used to attack coalition forces and their allies.
""As the second coalition strike on an active Daesh fighting position originating from a mosque in less than a week, Daesh demonstrates desperation and the willingness to misuse protected structures to launch military attacks against SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) and coalition forces,"" the Monday statement said.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",India's Congress will not name Gandhi as PM candidate in election battle,"By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition Congress party said on Monday it would not name its leader Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate of an alliance seeking to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi in next year's general election.
Congress is working to build an opposition front with other parties in preparation for the vote, and spokesman Sanjay Jha said it would respect the ""aspirations"" of potential alliance partners though no alternative candidates will be nominated.
Jha said the party would be following the same strategy as it did in 2004 when its alliance defeated a coalition led by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) without formally naming a prime ministerial nominee.
""Defeating the BJP is our primary goal, and therefore the Congress party is going to be very politically accommodating because we believe that regional parties' aspirations and their ambitions will have to be respected depending upon relative strengths in different areas,"" he told Reuters on Monday.
Many of Congress's potential alliance parties are run by ambitious regional leaders with years of governance experience.
Echoing Jha's comments, senior Congress leader and former finance and interior minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said the party's main focus was on forging an alliance to win the election, due by May 2019.
""We want to form a coalition, make it win and then the parties involved will decide who becomes prime minister,"" he told TV channel News18 Tamil Nadu in an interview broadcast at the weekend.
SCION OF NEHRU-GANDHI DYNASTY
Gandhi, 48, is a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for nearly four decades since its independence from Britain in 1947.
Unlike Modi, a powerful orator who ran the western state of Gujarat before becoming prime minister, Gandhi has never held a ministerial position despite being a lawmaker since 2004 and critics question whether he has the charisma or experience to defeat Modi.
The decision by Congress not to impose Gandhi's candidacy could also be exploited by Modi to suggest the opposition alliance is indecisive and not fit for government, political analysts say.
It comes as the party struggles to hold together a so-called ""grand alliance"" ahead of not only next year's national vote but a series of state elections this year. Modi, meanwhile, is being buffeted by a jobs crisis and farm distress.
An opinion poll by TV channel Times Now predicted in August that nationally Congress would raise its seat count in the lower house of parliament next year to 78 from 44 in 2014.

The BJP is projected to continue its lead over other parties, though its seat strength could fall to 227 from 282 at the last election. A party needs to win 272 seats for a simple-majority out of the 543 seats in fray.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Armenian parliament votes down changes to electoral code,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - The Armenian parliament on Monday voted down changes to the country's electoral code ahead of an early election expected to be held in December.
The changes were proposed by the government led by former opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, who was put in power by a parliamentary vote in May after weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism.
Pashinyan resigned from his post last week in order for parliament to be dissolved and an early election held. He has said the composition of parliament does not reflect the country's new political reality and changes to the electoral code were necessary for the vote to be more democratic and fair.
The amendments needed 63 votes to pass, but received only 56 as many lawmakers from the former ruling Republican Party did not support the draft.
""The parliamentary majority and its supporters are doing their best to conduct a sabotage policy ... hoping to turn these election into a revenge tool,"" Pashinyan, who is now acting prime minister, said.
""Even if the elections are held according to the old electoral code, if won't change anything as people's victory is inevitable,"" he said.
Proposed amendments included conducting the vote only by party lists, the abolition of restrictions on the number of participants in coalitions formed after the first round, the reduction of the electoral thresholds to four percent from five percent for parties and to six percent from seven percent for blocks, the reduction of deadlines for the accreditation of observers and journalists and guarantees to ensure a free vote by the military.
The amendments were mostly welcomed by the Council of Europe's Venice Commission.
Early parliamentary elections can be called in the ex-Soviet republic of three million people if parliament fails twice to choose a new prime minister and the legislature is dissolved.
Public support for parties not affiliated with Pashinyan is very low - not only for the former ruling Republican party but also others including Prosperous Armenia and Dashnaktsutyun.
The My Step Alliance, which includes Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party, won 81 percent of the mayoral vote in the capital Yerevan last month.
Pashinyan, whose popularity rating is high, said earlier this month he wanted parliamentary elections to be held in the first half of December.

TAIPEI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait on Monday in the second such operation this year, as the U.S. military increases the frequency of transits through the strategic waterway despite opposition from China.
The voyage risks further heightening tensions with China but will likely be viewed in self-ruled Taiwan as a sign of support by President Donald Trump's government, amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing.
Reuters was first to report U.S. consideration of the sensitive operation on Saturday.
""The ships' transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Commander Nate Christensen, deputy spokesman for U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in a statement.
""The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,"" he added.
Taiwan's defense ministry said it closely monitored the operation and was able to ""maintain the security of the seas and the airspace"" as it occurred. 
There was no immediate comment from China. 
The U.S. Navy conducted a similar mission in the strait's international waters in July, which had been the first such voyage in about a year. The latest operation shows the U.S. Navy is increasing the pace of strait passages. 
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island's main source of arms. The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taiwan more than $15 billion in weaponry since 2010.
STATUS QUO?
China views Taiwan as a wayward province and has been ramping up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island. It raised concerns over U.S. policy toward Taiwan in talks last week with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Singapore.
As the United States prepared for a fresh passage through the strait, it told China's military that its overall policy toward Taiwan was unchanged.
Mattis delivered that message to China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe personally on Thursday, on the sidelines of an Asian security forum.
""Minister Wei raised Taiwan and concerns about our policy. The Secretary reassured Minister Wei that we haven't changed our Taiwan policy, our one China policy,"" Randall Schriver, a U.S. assistant secretary of defense who helps guide Pentagon policy in Asia, told reporters traveling with Mattis.
""So it was, I think, a familiar exchange.""
Taiwan is only one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which also include a bitter trade war, U.S. sanctions, and China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.
Taiwan's relations with China have deteriorated since the island's President Tsai Ing-wen from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party swept to power in 2016.
Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, responded to the July passage with a warning to the United States to avoid jeopardizing ""peace and stability"" in the strategic waterway. 
It has also viewed U.S. overtures toward Taiwan with alarm, including its unveiling a new de facto embassy in Taiwan and passage of the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages U.S. officials to visit the island. 
Military experts say the balance of power between Taiwan and China has shifted decisively in China's favor in recent years, and China could easily overwhelm the island unless U.S. forces came quickly to Taiwan's aid.
China has also alarmed Taiwan by ramping up military exercises this year, including flying bombers and other military aircraft around the island and sending its aircraft carrier through the narrow Taiwan Strait separating it from Taiwan.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",EU eyes Brexit customs deal to break Irish deadlock: sources,"By Alastair Macdonald and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union negotiators are looking at ways to promise Britain a customs deal that could stretch Brussels' Brexit red lines but might break a deadlock over the Irish border, EU sources close to the talks have told Reuters.
Accounts of how British and EU negotiators came close to a deal on Oct. 13 focus on how Prime Minister Theresa May balked at an EU demand for a ""backstop"" clause. This could put Northern Ireland in a special relationship with the EU that might distance it from the British mainland to avoid putting up customs posts on Britain's only EU land border, with Ireland.
But as the two sides try to rebuild momentum following a Brussels summit last week, the readiness of EU negotiator Michel Barnier's team in that outline deal to soften their refusal to pre-empt the outcome of later talks on a future EU-UK trade pact may help in unlocking an acceptable package.
EU diplomats briefed on the negotiations said a vital part of a complex package was to ""anchor"" a reference in the legally-binding withdrawal treaty to May's proposal to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs partnership with the EU -- thus avoiding special treatment for Northern Ireland.
Negotiators, who declined direct comment for this report, acknowledged in briefings to EU officials the difficulties of linking the treaty to a more general, and non-binding, political declaration of intent on future relations.
But the EU's shift, as talks move into an end-game where failure would see Britain crashing out of the bloc in March, is part of what one senior negotiator calls a ""jigsaw"" solution --elements of which on their own cross one side or the other's red lines but that, as a whole, form a package both can live with.
BACKSTOP
The EU is now considering May's ""all-UK backstop"" offer. Under this both Northern Ireland and the mainland would remain within an effective EU customs area, avoiding a ""hard border"" that risks reviving violence in the north against British rule.
One problem for the EU has been that May's proposal seemed to extend what was meant to be a specially favorable deal for one small region to Europe's third ranked economy. It could be considered only under tighter terms, the EU said. The second problem is that such talks should start only after Brexit.
Still, the EU has signaled a will to blur its distinction between Brexit treaty talks and post-Brexit negotiations -- a move that London has demanded since talks started. ""You cannot absolutely keep separate the withdrawal treaty and the declaration on the future relationship,"" Barnier's boss, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker, said two weeks ago.
Building an ""all-UK customs element"" into the treaty to be finalised soon would, EU officials argue, lend May credibility for her insistence to critics at home that Northern Ireland will never need to be treated differently from the mainland. 
The EU also volunteered to extend the post-Brexit status quo transition period by a year until the end of 2021. This would be to ensure more time to negotiate the kind of all-UK customs arrangement that would satisfy Brussels' demands that Britain abide by rules preventing it getting an unfair advantage in EU markets.
However, the EU still wants a ""Northern Ireland-only"" clause to fall back on in case that UK deal cannot be closed -- that in the end was a dealbreaker for London before last week's summit.
An early offer of an EU-UK customs arrangement, note EU officials, also runs a risk of angering Britons who want to hold May to her rejection of a customs union. The arrangement both sides are studying is very close to a customs union in EU eyes, but Brussels understands that May cannot call it that.
The timetable for talks has been shifted back as May faces stiff opposition within her own party and allies to the Irish and customs elements of a deal. But EU leaders expressed growing confidence after meeting May last week that the jigsaw would fall into place in time for parliamentary ratification by March.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 12:07PM ET</span>","With divorce deal almost done, May repeats rejection of EU proposal on Northern Ireland","By Kylie MacLellan and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will on Monday say that 95 percent of Britain's Brexit deal has been agreed but repeat her opposition to a European Union proposal for the Irish border, a major stumbling block, as criticism within her party grows.
Facing some of the fiercest attacks to date over her Brexit plans after again failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week, May will try to calm passions in parliament where her strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU supporters alike.
With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current proposed end date of December 2020 has further riled both pro- and anti-EU factions in her deeply split Conservative Party.
The extent of opposition to her plans could be laid bare on Wednesday when pro-Brexit lawmakers, including the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government, plan to stage a rebellion on a piece of legislation related to the province.
On Monday, in an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made in over a year of talks with the EU, she will tell parliament the government has reached agreement on everything from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" May will say, according to excerpts from her statement to parliament.
""The shape of the deal across the vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement is now clear.""
But the deal - the terms of Britain's divorce - cannot be signed off until the two sides settle on future management of the border between Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland.
British and EU leaders are both committed to keeping the border open, a crucial aspect of the 1998 Good Friday peace deal that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed.
The EU proposal - for Northern Ireland to remain in the bloc's customs union - has been rejected by May as it would potentially create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain, something ruled out by Northern Ireland's DUP party.
At an EU summit in Brussels last week, any agreement seemed just as far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and diplomats saying that May had offered nothing new to ease the deadlock.
Since then, her proposal to extend the transition period has stoked anger among Conservative eurosceptics, who fear she is leading Britain into a deal that will make Britain a ""vassal state"" indefinitely - unable ever to fully leave the EU or to forge its own free trade deals with other countries.
NATIONAL INTEREST
Critics of May used Britain's Sunday newspapers to rhetorically savage the British leader, with unnamed rivals using phrases such as ""assassination is in the air"".
A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the party's so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers to demand such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
Newspapers reported May had been summoned to address Conservative lawmakers in a private meeting on Wednesday. The Daily Telegraph said she had held a 90-minute conference call with her top ministers on Sunday to try and shore up support.
On Wednesday one prominent hardline Brexiteer, former junior Brexit minister Steve Baker, will try to block the EU's backstop plan by attaching amendments to legislation passing through parliament that would effectively make the proposal illegal. 
The Telegraph reported the DUP planned to join with 40 Conservative lawmakers to vote in support of the amendment. May's spokesman responded that the government would look at the amendment ""in the usual way"".
The scale of votes against the government could provide an indication of how many may ultimately refuse to back any final Brexit deal with the EU when it is voted on in parliament.
Britain's sterling currency suffered its worst day in a month on Monday as fears grew that the Irish border issue and Conservative infighting would see May face a leadership challenge. 
May used a piece in Monday's Sun newspaper to stress that the Brexit negotiations were not about her and her future.
""When I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom,"" she wrote.

""Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest - and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.""

Pomegranate exports were a key source of income for people in Saada in northwest Yemen, a province under the control of the Houthi movement aligned with Iran. Before the war began in 2015, farmers exported 30,000 tons of the fruit.
Those exports have fallen by around a third and farmers blame lack of fuel and water for irrigation and the impact of aerial bombing by a coalition of forces led by Saudi Arabia and armed by the United States, France, Britain and other Western countries.
Markets and roads have been targeted, making it much more dangerous and, crucially, more expensive to get pomegranates by truck to Yemen's main port in Hodeidah, the farmers say.
The coalition is fighting to restore the internationally-recognized government that was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Many bombs have fallen on civilian areas. The coalition denies targeting civilians deliberately.
""The pomegranates are dying because of lack of water because of the blockade,"" said farmer Rabeea al-Abdy.
He was referring to stringent measures put in place by the coalition on imports into Yemen that have slowed trade flows, including of commercial goods and vital supplies such as fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid.
The coalition says the measures are necessary to prevent the Houthis smuggling in weapons from Iran. Both the Houthis and Iran deny engaging in such smuggling.
Ali Saleh, an agricultural sales manager in Saada, said exports are down by a third from their pre-war peak.
""The war ... led to a rise in the prices of fuel. Farming necessities ... have seen a crazy rise in prices in comparison to the farmers' costs which has had a huge impact on production,"" he said.
Three-quarters of the Yemeni population, or 22 million people, require aid and 8.4 million people are on the brink of starvation, according to U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths.
The United Nations is trying to broker talks to end the war but in the interim aid officials say the key to reducing the risk of famine is not charity but improving the economy: exports of the humble pomegranate could be a small part of the answer.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Japan hopes to clinch a military logistics pact with India that will allow access to each other's bases, Tokyo's envoy said on Monday, in a tightening of security ties seen as designed to balance China's growing weight in the region.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting Japan this weekend for an annual summit with his counterpart Shinzo Abe, and the proposed Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement between the two militaries is on the agenda.
Under Modi and Abe, bilateral relations have rapidly expanded and the two countries conduct three-way naval exercises involving the United States in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. 
Japan's ambassador to India, Kenji Hiramatsu, said it was only natural for the two militaries to have a logistics-sharing agreement because of the large number of maneuvers they were carrying out each year. 
""We hope to start formal negotiations with regard to signing of the ACSA. It is high time we had mutual logistics support,"" he said. 
Under such a pact, Japanese ships would get access to fuel and servicing at major Indian naval bases including the Andaman and Nicobar islands, which lie near the Malacca Straits through which a large amount of Japan's but also China's trade and fuel supplies is shipped.
India's navy, which is increasingly sending ships further out as a way to counter China's expanding presence in the Indian Ocean, would get access to Japanese facilities for maintenance.
Modi's government signed a similar agreement with the United States in 2016 ending years of hesitation by previous administrations that worried about upsetting China.
Beijing has in the past expressed concern about multilateral and complex exercises, calling them destabilizing to the region.
Hiramatsu said Japan and India had a great deal of convergence with respect to freedom of navigation and transparency in the Indio-Pacific region.

General Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan's most feared anti-Taliban commanders, was shot dead when a member of the provincial governor's bodyguard opened fire on officials leaving a meeting with NATO forces commander General Scott Miller.
Razeq, nominally the Kandahar police chief, was one of the most powerful figures in the whole of southern Afghanistan.
He had a range of business interests and was accused of extracting millions of dollars from the border crossing into Pakistan at Spin Boldak, his home region and power base.
A member of the powerful Pashtun Achakzai tribe and a skillful operator in the region's complex tribal politics, he regularly clashed with Ghani's government in Kabul but enjoyed wide support and was impossible to remove.
The nomination of Razeq's younger brother Tadeen Khan as acting police chief of Kandahar followed heavy pressure from powerful tribal elders who forced the government to overlook his lack of experience and training.
Ghani's government initially rejected the demand on the grounds that Khan lacked qualifications, a senior Afghan official said, but gave way after the Achakzais threatened to boycott parliamentary elections.
""Ghani knows he will need the support of many tribes to retain power, so he has to listen to them and accept their demands,"" said Abdul Rashid Khan a political science professor at Kabul University.
Parliamentary elections, a dry run for the more important presidential election next year, will be held in Kandahar on Saturday after they were postponed for a week following Razeq's death in an insider attack at the provincial governor's office.
His death left a power vacuum in Kandahar, one of the most strategically important provinces in Afghanistan, on the southeastern border with Pakistan. 

""It would require a lot of consultations and appeasement to convince general Razeq's supporters and his tribe to approve someone else as the police chief,"" said a senior government official as he explained the reason behind Khan's appointment.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Belgium has chosen Lockheed Martin's (N:LMT) F-35 stealth jets over the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging F-16s, news agency Belga cited government sources as saying, in a move that would cement the U.S.-made war plane's position in Europe.
The country has been deliberating for months over a multibillion-dollar purchase of 34 new fighter jets, with the latest deadline for a decision being Oct. 29.
A defense ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the government's decision and did not confirm the end-October deadline.
Lockheed spokeswoman Carolyn Nelson did not confirm that a decision had been made but said the company remains confident that the F-35 is the right choice for Belgium.
""The F-35 offers transformational capability for the Belgian Air Force and, if selected, will align them with a global coalition operating the world's most advanced aircraft.""
If confirmed, the decision will make Belgium the 12th country to buy the radar-evading F-35 jets and could help to strengthen the U.S. aerospace company's position in forthcoming tenders in Switzerland, Finland and Germany.
The decision, the likely outcome of which was reported by Reuters last Friday, had been expected in July before the NATO summit in Brussels. The order for jets due for delivery from 2023 is estimated to be worth 3.6 billion euros ($4.14 billion). [nL2N1WV11Y]
Washington has extended the terms of the F-35 bid to Oct. 31 at Brussels' request, U.S. sources said, adding that any further delay would trigger changes in pricing. 
Lockheed has said its bid will give Belgian companies significant opportunities to contribute to the global F-35 enterprise.
EUROFIGHTER BLOW
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has previously said he would like to make the decision on the F-16 replacements before a national election in May and Defence Minister Steven Vandeput has said he hoped to settle the matter before he steps down at the end of the year.
A win for Lockheed would mark a setback for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, the four countries behind the Eurofighter program, who had mounted a strong lobbying campaign for the European war plane.
It is also likely to anger France, which did not submit a formal bid for the Rafale fighter built by Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) but had offered Belgium close defense cooperation to prevent a further spread of the F-35 in Europe.
Other European buyers of the F-35 include Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Turkey and Norway.

The Eurofighter is flown by Germany, Britain, Austria, Italy and Spain.

One migrant died after falling off the seven-meter high metal barrier on Sunday, while 22 others and 12 security personnel were injured, the interior ministry said.
Around 200 people got over into Melilla and were taken to a reception center, Spanish authorities said. But the rest who failed would be returned to their home countries, Morocco said, without giving details of the nationalities.
Morocco, which other Africans can visit without visas, has become a major gateway for migrants into Europe since Italy' tougher line and EU aid to the Libyan coastguard curbed the number of people coming from Libya.
More than 6,000 migrants have made it to Melilla and Spain’s nearby territory Ceuta so far this year, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
Others pay smugglers to get them across the 14 km (9 miles) of sea to Spain.
The vast majority of arrivals in Spain are men, primarily from Guinea, Mali and Morocco, the UNHCR says.
In July, 800 migrants stormed the Ceuta fence triggering a crackdown by Moroccan authorities which has been bussing migrants to the south of the country away from the borders with Spain.
Under a bilateral agreement, Spain returned 24 migrants to Morocco on Saturday who had reached the Chafarinas islands, another Spanish territory off the North African coast - and another 116 migrants who had managed to jump the border fence of Ceuta in August.

Sanader - who has dismissed the proceedings as politically motivated - was not taken into custody and left the court without making a statement. His lawyer, Jadranka Slokovic, said he had already spent longer than that period in detention and would appeal. 
The judge said Sanader received 3.6 billion kuna ($557.13 million) from Hypo when he was deputy foreign minister - an act that she said amounted to war profiteering. 
He then cleared the way for the bank - which has since collapsed - to loan Croatia money to buy buildings for embassies and consulates, the judge added in a statement broadcast live on state TV.
Sanader, who went on to become prime minister from 2003 to 2009, was originally convicted and jailed over the case in 2012 - then had the conviction overturned three years ago after the Constitutional Court said he had been denied a fair trial.
At the end of his re-trial on Monday, the court ordered Sanader to pay back the bribe to the state.
In a separate re-trial set to begin on Tuesday, Sanader is charged with taking a bribe from Hungarian energy group MOL in 2008 to let it get a dominant position in Croatia's energy firm INA. MOL's chief executive Zsolt Hernadi is also charged and will be tried in absentia.

Sanader, Hernadi and MOL have all denied any wrongdoing in that case.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 09:23AM ET</span>",Poland's euroskeptic government falling further behind with urban voters,"By Marcin Goclowski and Justyna Pawlak
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling euroskeptics could see their firm grip on power loosened over the next couple of years as liberal, city-dwellers angry at the government's democratic record are voting against them in growing numbers, regional elections showed.
Final results of Sunday's nationwide ballot for city hall chiefs and provincial assemblies will be published on Tuesday at the earliest, the electoral commission said on Monday. But exit polls showed Law and Justice (PiS) made only limited gains and lost a high-profile contest for Warsaw mayor.
While still more popular than the centrist opposition around the country overall, the PiS government saw its support fall in big cities, traditionally bastions of liberalism in Poland.
The outcome lays bare mounting divisions in the country over PiS policies toward the judiciary and media that critics at home and abroad say point to a tilt towards authoritarianism. 
PiS says its institutional reforms aim at making Poland a fairer society that is less dependent on the European Union.
""The magnitude of our victory is not what we had expected,"" Zbigniew Kuzmiuk, a PiS member of the European Parliament, told public radio. ""There was an extraordinary mobilisation on the other side, because of the polarisation (of society).""
The election is part of a larger battle for Europe's soul as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like PiS believes the EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
An exit poll by Ipsos pollster showed PiS scoring 33 percent of votes for provincial assemblies, against 26.7 percent for a centrist coalition. 
In cities of over 500,000 inhabitants, PiS won 23.1 percent, against 47.3 percent for its main opponents. Four years earlier, that gap stood at 25.2 percent against 44.1 percent.
Markets showed little reaction to Sunday's vote, although economists said PiS may have to loosen the purse strings in the coming months as it heads toward a parliamentary election in 2019 and a presidential vote in 2020.
If repeated in the parliamentary election, the provincial assembly results would mean PiS could struggle to retain its grip on power without entering into a coalition.
WARSAW POWER
Exit polls also showed that PiS lost most of the 10 large cities where voting was surveyed, although several contests face a runoff on Nov. 4.
In the race for Warsaw mayor, centrist candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, unexpectedly won office in the first round, with 54.1 percent of vote, more than the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
""European issues were used as a bugbear in this election,"" said Jaroslaw Flis, a political scientist from the Jagiellonian University in the southern city of Krakow.
Underscoring tensions over Poland's relationship with the EU and the country's contested judiciary reforms, the Supreme Court on Monday urged judges forcibly retired by PiS to return to the work.
Its call follows a decision by the European Court of Justice that Warsaw should suspend an overhaul of the top court and reinstate the forcibly retired judges.
Most Poles back EU membership. But PiS has consistently accused Brussels institutions of hurting its efforts to reform the nation which it says has lost touch with conservative Catholic roots and become too liberal.
Krzysztof Goworek, a 41-year-old financial market analyst, is among the urban voters who find its rhetoric unacceptable.

""I don't like what's going on in the country,"" he said outside a voting station in Warsaw. ""All these games around democratic standards which are in place in Poland.""

The death comes as India's Christian community is reeling from a string of cases - including the arrests of five priests in August on allegations of sexual assault.
Police said the body of Kuriakose Kattuthara, a Catholic priest who police said had spoken to them about Bishop Franco Mulakkal, was found in his room in a church in the northern state of Punjab.
""There were no blood marks on his body, and we are investigating the cause of death,"" said Achhru Ram, a senior Punjab state police official in the Dasuya region.
Mulakkal, bishop of the Diocese of Jalandhar in Punjab, was arrested in the southern state of Kerala last month on charges of raping the nun.
The Kerala nun had accused him of raping her repeatedly over a period of two years. Just before his arrest, the Vatican had accepted a request from the bishop to be temporarily relieved of his pastoral duties.
He is now on bail.
Neither Mulakkal nor his lawyers have made any public comment since his arrest though he has denied the charges in media interviews in the past.
He did not immediately respond to email requests seeking comment on Monday.
The diocese of Jalandhar said in a statement on its web site that Mulakkal had expressed sadness over ""the sudden demise"" of Kattuthara.
Kerala police had said earlier that Kattuthara was a prosecution witness who had given them a statement.
Outside India, the Catholic Church is facing sexual abuse scandals in the United States, Chile, Australia, Germany and other countries.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea and the U.N. Command agreed on Monday to withdraw firearms and guard posts in the demilitarized zone village of Panmunjom this week, Seoul's defense ministry said, the latest move in a fast-improving relationship.
The three sides held their second round of talks at Panmunjom to discuss ways to demilitarize the border in line with a recent inter-Korean pact reached at last month's summit in Pyongyang. 
The U.S.-led UNC, which has overseen affairs in the DMZ since the end of hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War, was not immediately available for comment, but it said on Friday it supports the two Koreas' efforts to implement their military deal.
The announcement comes amid U.S. concerns that the inter-Korean military initiative could undermine defense readiness and comes without substantial progress on North Korea's promised denuclearization.
The neighbors are looking to withdraw 11 guard posts within a 1-km (0.6-mile) radius of the Military Demarcation Line on their border by the end of the year. 
They also plan to pull out all firearms from a Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom and cut to 35 each the numbers of personnel stationed there and share information on surveillance equipment. 
At Monday's meeting, the three sides agreed to remove firearms and guard posts from the JSA by Thursday, and carry out a joint inspection over the following two days, the ministry said. 
The two Koreas have been removing landmines around the area as part of the agreement and they confirmed the completion of the demining operation at the talks with the UNC. 
""We discussed the timeline of the pullout of firearms and guard posts, as well as ways to adjust the number of guard personnel and conduct joint inspections,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
The agreement also includes a halt in ""all hostile acts"" and a no-fly zone around the border.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, but relations have improved considerably in the last year.
After his third summit in Pyongyang, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the North was ready to invite international experts to watch the dismantling of a key missile site and would close the main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took reciprocal actions.
Those actions could include putting a formal end to the 1950-53 war, opening of a U.S. liaison office in North Korea, humanitarian aid and an exchange of economic experts, Moon said.

But Washington demands North Korea takes irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, such as a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and material.

""One cannot help but wonder how there could have been a 'fistfight' between 15 young expert fighters ... and a 60-year-old Khashoggi, alone and defenceless,"" said Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Erdogan in his AK Party.
""It explains no aspect of the incident according to all the information reached - on the contrary, it leads to even more questions,"" Aktay, who is also a close friend of Khashoggi, wrote in a column in Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak.
""The more one thinks about it, the more it feels like our intelligence is being mocked,"" he wrote. 
After two weeks denying involvement in his disappearance, Saudi Arabia said early on Saturday that Khashoggi, a critic of the country's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had died in a fight inside the building.
Within hours a senior Saudi official told Reuters that a team of 15 Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed him in a chokehold when he resisted.
Then on Sunday Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that while he did not know exactly how Khashoggi had died, his killing was a ""rogue operation"" in which Saudi individuals had exceeded their authority.
""They made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it,"" Jubeir said.
The minister also sought to shield the crown prince from the aftermath of the incident, saying he had not been aware.
Aktay said the crown prince, known as MbS, had responded to criticism by attacking Turkey, and said Saudi Arabian media had written disparagingly about Khashoggi's fiancee, his friend Turan Kislakci and Aktay himself.
""The 'fistfight' argument regarding Khashoggi's death is a scenario which was hastily made up, as it became clear that all the details of the incident will soon come out,"" Aktay wrote.
On Sunday, Erdogan said he would release information about the Turkish investigation at his weekly speech on Tuesday to members of his AK Party.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Spying is getting harder because the same technologies that catch terrorists can sometimes uncover foreign intelligence operations, the director of Israel's Mossad said on Monday.
Joseph (Yossi) Cohen delivered rare public remarks at a budget conference held by Israel's Finance Ministry. That suggested he may have emerged from the shadows to safeguard the funds and personnel allotment that, according to Israeli daily Haaretz, have made Mossad ""the second largest spy organization in the West"" after the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. 
Cohen described Mossad as the tip of Israel's spear against threats like Iranian nuclear and missile projects and Iranian backing for Palestinian Islamist Hamas militants. 
But, outlining challenges to covert Mossad officers such as facial recognition technology and digitally enhanced identification documents, he said: ""Everywhere we go, we have to take into account the fact that security services are getting stronger.
""For normal people, this (technology) is good. For people who don't want it so much, the matter is of course a challenge of a different order."" 
""You can imagine that a large part of the agency's problems or challenges speak to the fact that your passport is, essentially, in your fingerprint, in your retina, or in your face,"" Cohen said, describing such measures as often designed primarily for counter-terrorism rather than counter-espionage.
""This arena, which very much affects us, has changed beyond recognition and is ballooning.""
In 2010, the United Arab Emirates accused Mossad of killing a Hamas arms procurer in Dubai and published CCTV video of the fugitive hit team as well as their forged Western passports - an embarrassment for Israel, although it declined comment.
Since Cohen took over in 2016, Mossad is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas men in Malaysia and Tunisia. In neither incident was Dubai-like footage made public - an indication that the killers eluded surveillance. 
Cohen praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who has withdrawn from the international nuclear deal with Iran and recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital - moves that, respectively, dismayed Washington's major European allies and angered Palestinians, who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek in Israeli-occupied territory. 
Cohen said various powers' handling of Middle East hotspots like Syria ""is, of course, very much affected by the change in approach since President Trump took office, which, I think, is very pleasant for us, as the State of Israel. 

""There is a kind of feeling - including in me - that there is a differentiation, between the good guys and the bad guys, being done in a more dichotomous, simpler and clearer manner.""

The unidentified man insulted her after complaining that she had inconvenienced him as he tried to reach his seat aboard .
""Don't talk to me in a fucking foreign language you stupid ugly cow,"" the man tells the woman before a man in the row behind asks him to stop.
""I will carry on as long as I can with this ugly black bastard,"" he retorts.
Ryanair said that they were aware of the matter and had reported it to the police. The airline's chief financial officer declined to comment on the story.
""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation,"" the police said in a statement. 
The video was taken by another passenger while the plane was waiting to take off from Barcelona to London Stansted airport on Friday.
After the argument, the woman was eventually moved from her seat. A flight attendant appears to tell the man he will discuss the incident with his supervisor, but the passenger is left in his place.
""I've seen airlines ground to a halt, and police called, and passengers escorted off of planes for less,"" David Lawrence, who recorded the video, told BBC Radio. 
The police investigation comes as the Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, announced on Monday a 7 percent fall in profits in the first six months of the year. Ryanair has been grappling with the impact of recent strikes, high fuel costs and intense competition. [nL8N1X2110]
Britain's interior minister resigned earlier this year over the treatment of some Caribbean ""Windrush"" migrants who were invited to Britain after World War Two but were left without documents and denied basic rights, a scandal that highlighted persistent racial inequalities in British society.
Lawrence added that the woman, who he is in touch with, was from the Windrush generation, and that the frequency of such racist abuse made people numb to it.
""If the roles had been reversed, if that was a black man abusing an elderly, disabled white woman, I know that the outcome would have been completely different,"" he said.

685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","North Korea bought at least $640 million in luxury goods from China in 2017, South Korea lawmaker says","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea imported at least $640 million worth of luxury goods from China last year, in defiance of U.N. sanctions outlawing such trade over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, a South Korean lawmaker said on Monday.
The United States has urged strict implementation of sanctions as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign which Washington has credited with bringing impoverished North Korea to the negotiating table.
But there have been signs the campaign has been losing steam since North Korea suspended nuclear and missile tests and leader Kim Jong Un vowed steps towards denuclearization at a U.S.-North Korean summit in June - and as China and Russia called for relaxed sanctions.
""Kim has bought lavish items from China and other places like a seaplane for not only his own family, and also expensive musical instruments, high-quality TVs, sedans, liquor, watches and fur as gifts for the elites who prop up his regime,"" opposition lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun said in a statement. 
""With the growing loophole, Kim would be able to near his goal of neutralizing sanctions soon without giving up the nuclear weapons.""
Last year, North Korea spent at least $640 million on luxury goods from China, according to Yoon. 
China does not provide breakdowns of its customs figures. Yoon compiled data based on a list of banned items crafted by Seoul in line with a 2009 U.N. resolution.
Beijing's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has said it strictly abides by international sanctions against North Korea. 
The 2017 luxury trade volume was down from the 2014 peak of $800 million, but was only a 3.8 percent drop from $666.4 million in 2016, according to Yoon.
The luxury items accounted for 17.8 percent of North Korea's entire imports from China last year which totaled $3.7 billion, Yoon said. 
Purchases of electronic products such as high-end TVs made up for more than half of the total transactions, worth $340 million, followed by cars with $204 million and liquors with $35 million. 
China's trade with North Korea from January to August this year tumbled 57.8 percent from the year-earlier figure to $1.51 billion, China's customs agency said last month.
But Yoon's analysis also shows North Korea funneled more than $4 billion into luxury shopping in China since Kim took power at the end of 2011. 
Yoon accused China of loosening enforcement of sanctions, and criticized South Korea's recent request for U.N. and U.S. exemptions to restart inter-Korean economic cooperation.
When asked on Monday about the possibility of discord with the United States over sanctions, a senior official at South Korea's presidential office said the two countries would ""eventually be on the same path"" towards denuclearization though there might be a ""procedural difference"".

Last week, Singapore charged a citizen, a North Korean and three companies with supplying prohibited luxury items to North Korea. The charges involve hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of perfumes, wines and watches, court documents seen by Reuters show.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - A U.S.-bound caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants whom President Donald Trump has declared unwelcome, crowded into the Mexican border city of Tapachula on Sunday, setting up impromptu camps in public spaces under a heavy rain.
Members of the caravan, exhausted from the hours-long trek on foot from the Guatemalan border, mostly ignored police offers to board buses heading to a migrant shelter because of suspicions they might be deported instead.
The migrants have defied threats by Trump that he will close the U.S.-Mexico border if the caravan advances, as well as warnings from the Mexican government that they risk deportation if they cannot justify seeking asylum in Mexico.
On Sunday, Trump said on Twitter that ""full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens,"" arguing that the migrants must apply for asylum in Mexico before attempting to petition U.S. authorities.
In southern Mexico, police in riot gear shadowed the caravan's arrival along a southern highway, but did not impede their journey.
Among the throngs hiking into the center of the city was Roger Pineda, a 16-year-old Honduran.
""I just want to find some food and a place to sleep,"" he said, explaining he joined the caravan last week with five family members and a group of friends from the violent city of San Pedro Sula.
""I hope Trump allows us to make it to the other side,"" he said.
In Guatemala, local media reported that around 1,000 migrants were traveling north en route to the Mexican border.
A large column of people marched under a burning sun Sunday as a military helicopter circled low overhead. Many migrants said they were fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption in Central America.
Most said they felt safer advancing in a large group.
""We're going to make it, we're going to keep moving so long as they don't stop us,"" said Honduran Jaffe Borjas, 17, marching alongside a childhood friend at the head of the column that stretched far down the highway to the horizon.
Along the route north to Tapachula, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the border, some broke into song.
""If you send us back, we will return!"" a large crowd shouted in unison. 
""We are not criminals, we are workers!""
'EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS'
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador supported the caravan and promised to provide people with work permits in a speech to supporters in Tuxtla-Gutierrez, about 180 miles (290 km) north of Tapachula.
""I want to tell them they can count on us,"" said Lopez Obrador, who will take office in December, to a smattering of applause.
He reiterated that is seeking Trump's support to help fund a development plan that could alleviate poverty in Central America and southern Mexico.
Since the convoy formed last weekend, Trump has threatened to halt aid to Honduras and Guatemala, and potentially close the U.S. border with Mexico with the help of the military if the migrants' march is not stopped.
Mexico's government has said throughout the past week that it would register the migrants and process requests for asylum. Those attempting to skip the process would face deportation, but the size of the caravan will test Mexico, which has sought help from the United Nations to manage the issue.
More than 3,400 Hondurans migrants had been returned to their home country over the past 48 hours by Sunday afternoon, according to a migrant assistance body led by the wife of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, Ana Garcia de Hernandez.
""We're urging people against migrating in an unlawful way and putting your children in extremely dangerous conditions,"" Garcia de Hernandez said in a statement. 
The Honduran government has also blamed the political opposition back home for encouraging the exodus of migrants.
Mexican immigration authorities said they had allowed some 1,028 migrants through the official border crossing in Ciudad Hidalgo near the bridge spanning the Suchiate River over the past three days.

The slow pace prompted thousands to cross the river illegally by raft or swimming to the shore.

Pollsters say Bolsonaro has an 18 percentage point lead over his leftist rival Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party (PT). With 95 percent of Bolsonaro's backers saying in surveys that they will not consider changing their votes, it would take a stunning twist for Haddad to pull out a win in Sunday's run-off ballot.
Tens of thousands of Bolsonaro's backers gathered in several cities across Brazil on Sunday, and the vibe was more of victory parties than pre-vote rallies. 
""This is a clear sign that citizens are truly concerned about the future of Brazil and want somebody different from the PT in the presidency,"" Bolsonaro said late Sunday in a television interview. 
Anti-Bolsonaro protesters gathered in fewer cities on Saturday for events that were mostly organized by a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group of women voters who oppose him. 
For his part, Haddad appealed to the PT's base of poorer Brazilians, promising to expand social programs and to put a cap on the spiking costs of cooking gas cylinders, primarily used in low-income homes.
Bolsonaro, 63, is a former army captain and seven-term congressman with an undistinguished career - he has authored just two bills that became law - who openly defends Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship. 
He has caught fire with an electorate seeking order after five years of dueling economic and political crises. Until this run, Bolsonaro was best known for making pro-junta, homophobic and misogynist rants over the years. 
The country's economy is still hobbling after emerging from its deepest recession in decades. Graft investigations have ensnared the political and business elite, and exposed stunning levels of political corruption that have hit every major party.

Haddad, a 55-year-old former mayor of Sao Paulo, only became the PT's candidate in September after imprisoned former president and PT founder Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was barred from running because of a corruption conviction.

In a statement, the military said the incident occurred near the biblical Cave of the Patriarchs, revered by Muslims as the Ibrahimi mosque, in the city of Hebron.
The soldier was slightly wounded in the attack and opened fire, along with other soldiers, at the assailant, killing him, according to the military.
Palestinians began a wave of knife and car-ramming attacks in the West Bank and in Israel in 2015, after peace talks with Israel collapsed. Such incidents have become more sporadic.

Smiley, commander of Resolute Support's training and advisory mission in southern Afghanistan, was shot when a member of the provincial governor's bodyguard opened fire on a group of officials leaving a meeting with the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller.
""I can confirm US. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Smiley was wounded during a recent insider attack in Afghanistan's Kandahar Province,"" a spokeswoman for the NATO-led force said in an emailed statement.
Miller was unhurt but Kandahar police chief, General Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan's most prominent anti-Taliban commanders, was fatally wounded along with the local head of the NDS intelligence service General Abdul Momim.
The attack, which was claimed by the Taliban, was a devastating blow to the government, decapitating the security command of one of Afghanistan's most strategically important provinces and demonstrating the insurgents' ability to strike even top leaders.
Along with Smiley, one U.S. civilian and a coalition contractor were wounded as the group of officials made their way to a helicopter due to take Miller and his party back to Kabul.

Indonesia and South Korea agreed in 2014 to develop the ""KF-X"" fighter jet. 
The project is estimated to be worth about $7.9 billion, and Indonesia had agreed to pay 20 percent of the development costs, but a senior Indonesia official said on Friday it was seeking ""lighter"" financial terms.
South Korea's arms procurement agency Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) told a press briefing the project was on track. 
""During the South Korea-Indonesia summit in September, it was agreed to continue developing the KF-X,"" the spokesman said.
""About the contribution, we plan to negotiate additionally."" 
The spokesman confirmed that Indonesia's unpaid contribution was about 230 billion won ($203.14 million), from between the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018. 
Indonesia's request on the financial terms of the deal comes as it is trying to support the rupiah, which is trading near a 20-year-low, and to reduce the use of foreign exchange reserves.
The Indonesian finance ministry's director general of budgeting, Askolani, told Reuters on Monday the government had decided to postpone a 2017 payment for the development of the fighter jet for ""further review"". He did not elaborate.
Indonesia's investment board chief Tom Lembong told reporters that Jakarta may seek to review its participation share in the project, the number of planes the military will buy, the delivery schedule and a ""flexibility"" for Indonesia to resell the aircraft.
Indonesia had committed to buy 48 of the fighter jets, Lembong said.
State news agency Antara reported in May that Indonesia was not allowed to sell the aircraft to other countries or produce components domestically, citing defense ministry spokesman Totok Sugiharto. 
Sugiharto was not available for comment on Monday.

YILAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen offered words of consolation on Monday as she met relatives of the 18 dead and 187 injured after a train derailed in the island's northeast, the worst rail disaster in more than three decades.
Officials said four carriages overturned on Sunday after all eight cars of a train carrying 366 passengers left the tracks on a bend near a railway station in Yilan county, about 40 km (25 miles) from Taipei, the capital. 
Tsai joined Buddhist monks in prayer before an altar adorned with flowers next to a county hospital, while nearby, relatives and friends of the victims wept as they sifted through battered suitcases recovered from the train wreck.
""We are really sorry ... you have to stay strong,"" Tsai told Chen Yu-chan, 41, whose only daughter, a seventh grader, was killed. 
""We will do everything we can,"" she told another person, who was sobbing bitterly during her visit to the hospital. 
Health authorities appealed for blood donations to help treat the many injured people, who included one foreigner, an American. Six of the dead were below 18, officials said. 
The disaster was Taiwan's deadliest rail tragedy since a 1981 collision in the northern region that killed 30 people, the official Central News Agency said. 
China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office expressed ""deep condolences"" to the families of victims.
Train services resumed early on Monday, after all the derailed carriages had been moved to one side of the tracks.
Authorities said they were investigating to determine the cause of the accident, which remains unclear. 
Many of the casualties happened in a carriage at the front of the train, said one official, adding that the driver, surnamed You, has been moved out of intensive care, though his condition was still unstable.
""We will ask him what happened after he stabilizes,"" said Liu Can-huang, head of the car maintenance unit of the railways. 
The train recorder, which tracks speed, among other data, has been sent to prosecutors to be examined, he added.
The derailment was not expected to cause a major disruption to economic activity, however.
WEDDING TRAGEDY
Tung Xiao-ling, 43, sobbed as she told Reuters how she had lost eight of 17 family members, aged nine to 67, as they returned from celebrating her sister's wedding. 
""No one can accept that one day you are a bride and the next day you are mourning a family member,"" said Tung, who was not on board the derailed train. 
""I hope they find out what happened as soon as possible. We trusted the safety of Puyuma,"" she said, referring to the express train line. 
The fastest of Taiwan's regular trains, the Puyuma Express began operating in 2013 to negotiate the rough terrain of the east coast. 
Hundreds of rescuers and military worked through the night, using spotlights to search the wreckage for survivors, as ambulances waited to take the injured to hospital. 
Some rescue workers gave first aid to the injured, while others used cranes to lift some of the battered cars sprawled in a zigzag near the tracks. 
""This is something that is not supposed to happen when taking a train,"" said Chen Tai-liang, whose niece, a seventh grader, was killed.

""Why did it happen?"" he asked, after speaking to Tsai.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday offered a rare national apology, only the second since 2008, to victims of institutional child sexual abuse and their families, bringing some survivors to tears.
The gesture followed a five-year inquiry into child sexual abuse that delved into more than 8,000 cases of sexual misconduct, most of them at religious and state-run institutions responsible for keeping children safe.
""Today, as a nation, we confront our failure to listen, to believe, and to provide justice,"" Morrison told lawmakers in the Australian capital, Canberra.
""We say sorry. To the children we failed, sorry. To the parents whose trust was betrayed and who have struggled to pick up the pieces, sorry.""
Expressions of national regret such as Monday's are reserved for egregious misdeeds in which the state has played a role.
In the previous instance in 2008, then prime minister Kevin Rudd apologized to members of the Stolen Generations of indigenous Australians, forcibly taken from their families and communities as young children under assimilation policies.
Morrison also repeated Monday's apology in a speech to nearly 800 victims, some of whom began to cry, images broadcast on television showed.
""It was very, very intense to be in that room,"" Graeme, a victim who identified himself only by his first name, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
""I looked around and I thought to myself there is not a room of stronger people anywhere in the country.""
He added, ""I am proud to be a victim and I am proud of all victims.""
Morrison vowed tougher oversight, although some victims say the government has failed to do enough.
""If they think saying sorry is going to finish it, it's not,"" Tony Wardley, who suffered abuse in the 1980s, told the broadcaster. ""There's still so much to be done.""
Australia set up a redressal scheme this year to pay abuse victims compensation of up to A$150,000 ($106,000) each.
But the conservative government has yet to decide if it will adopt recommendations from the wide-ranging national inquiry, most notably one requiring Catholic priests to report child abuse they may learn about in the confessional.
In August, a top Catholic body, the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference, said it would not comply with proposed state laws.

""We gave them a detailed list of asks, regarding technology for example, [which] basically hasn’t changed for five or six months. The problem with the story is that they don’t respond. Nothing. Nada,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told the Financial Times in an interview published Sunday in Washington. ""It’s really the president and the Chinese Communist party, they have to make a decision, and so far they have not, or they have made a decision not to do anything, nothing. I’ve never seen anything like it.""
Separately, Axios reported Sunday that Trump believes it will take more time for tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. on Chinese imports to have an impact on China’s economy, and he believes he will gain more leverage in trade negotiations the longer they remain in place.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet at the G20 summit of global leaders in Argentina next month. Trade talks have been on ice since late September, when the two countries implemented another round of tariffs on each other’s imports.
Kudlow’s comments and the Axios report follow a three-day stretch in which top Chinese officials including Xi sought to bolster investor confidence via statements as well as comments reported by state-run media outlets.
The benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index fell last week to its lowest level in four years as trade tensions and concerns about an economic slowdown weighed on sentiment. Growth decelerated to 6.5 percent in the third quarter, according to data published Oct. 19 by the National Bureau of Statistics.
In May, U.S. and Chinese negotiators issued long lists of demands during talks in Beijing. Among U.S. demands were a reduction in the country’s trade deficit with China and abandonment of subsidies and government support to industries included in its Made in China 2025 industrial policy program.
China’s demands included the U.S. ceasing a ban on exports to China of integrated circuits, opening government procurement to Chinese technology products and services, and giving Chinese companies equal treatment in national security reviews.
Gao Feng, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce, told reporters during a weekly press briefing on October 18 that the U.S. needs to show sincerity if it wishes to resume talks. His boss, Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, told Bloomberg that China would not back down in the face of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, adding that ""China doesn’t want a trade war, but would rise up to it should it break out.""

697,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Even Trump Citing ‘Lies’ as Allies Doubt Shifting Saudi Story,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s evolving account of the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- which the kingdom’s foreign minister on Sunday cast as a “tremendous mistake” perpetrated by a “rogue operation” -- elicited skepticism from officials in the U.S. and its allies weighing how to respond.
France demanded more information, while Germany put arms sales to the oil-rich nation on hold. In the U.S., the Trump administration stressed the vital importance of the kingdom and its economy to the U.S. while Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they suspected knowledge of the killing reached the highest levels of the Saudi regime.
More than two weeks after Khashoggi disappeared, Saudi Arabia acknowledged over the weekend that the Washington Post contributor was killed inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2, characterizing his death as accidental. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the killing was carried out by a “rogue operation” that then tried to cover it up. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had had no knowledge of the plot, he said.
“This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had,” al-Jubeir said in an interview on Fox News. “They made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it.”
The dramatic reversal -- Saudi officials had previously said the columnist left the building alive -- seems only to have complicated the issue for allies.
In Sunday radio and TV interviews, Dominic Raab, the U.K. politician in charge of negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union, described the latest Saudi account as not credible; French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called for “the truth’’; and Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his government would approve no arms sales so long as the investigation was ongoing.
Saudi Arabia is an important market for all three countries. On Sunday, they also issued a joint statement, saying the Saudi investigation’s “hypotheses” would “need to be backed by facts to be considered credible.”
‘Deception and Lies’
In an interview with The Washington Post, President Donald Trump, too, said the Saudi narrative had been marked by “deception and lies.’’ Yet he also defended the crown prince as a “strong person’’ and said there was no proof of his involvement in Khashoggi’s death. Some members of Congress have questioned his willingness to exonerate the prince.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to disclose details about the case at a meeting of his AK Party’s parliamentary faction on Tuesday, Haberturk newspaper reported.
Behind the rhetoric lie tough choices that the U.S. and other governments will have to make, between longstanding economic and defense ties to the kingdom and concern that failure to impose consequences on the slaying would give a green light for authoritarian regimes to kill inconvenient journalists and opponents worldwide.
“We have a longstanding relationship with Saudi that dates back to a long period of time,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters in Jerusalem, during the first stop on a six-country Middle East swing that will include a visit to Riyadh. “We will continue in that relationship while we also simultaneously get to the bottom of what the facts are about the Khashoggi situation, which obviously is a terrible situation.”
‘Not Enough’
The Treasury chief -- who canceled his participation in a Saudi investment conference this week -- said that while the world seeks answers as to what happened to Khashoggi, “the information that’s coming out is a good first step, but it’s obviously not enough.”
In the meantime, Russian businesses are flocking to attend the investment forum in Saudi Arabia, as Western counterparts pull out. Russian President Vladimir Putin has had considerable success boosting Moscow’s influence in the Middle East at U.S. expense, by standing by regimes that fall afoul of the West, including in Syria and Iran. Last week Putin signed a strategic and partnership agreement with Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, backed by $25 billion in loans to build nuclear reactors. Until El-Sisi came to power, Egypt had been closely allied to the U.S.
Uproar in Congress
According to the latest Saudi account, “discussions’’ of Khashoggi’s status turned violent at the consulate. He died after being placed in a choke hold, a person with knowledge of the Saudi probe said. That conflicts with reports from Turkish officials, who say a Saudi hit team flew in specifically to kill and dismember him. According to a New York Times report, some members of the group had close ties to the crown prince.
The killing has sparked bipartisan outrage in Congress over Saudi Arabia’s role, creating a divide between Capitol Hill and the White House ahead of November’s mid-term elections. Mnuchin said it would be “premature to comment on sanctions” related to the killing until “we’ve gotten to the bottom of what’s occurred.”
Terrorism Financing
If Trump has a message for Saudi officials related to the investigation of Khashoggi’s killing, Mnuchin said he would deliver it. He said discussions with the Saudis would focus on stopping terrorism financing.
Trump has strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia, which he sees as an essential player in advancing his Middle East policy. In the Washington Post interview, he stressed again the importance of Saudi Arabia to his policy of pressuring Iran -- a regime he described as “evil.’’ Trump also says the incident shouldn’t jeopardize U.S. weapon sales to Saudi Arabia or other potential investments, which he says are worth a total of $450 billion.
The president told reporters soon after the Saudi statement was published that “it’s a great first step. I think we’re getting close to solving a very big problem.” Later Saturday, speaking to reporters in Nevada, he said it was a concern that Khashoggi’s body is missing but reiterated that the journalist’s killing shouldn’t affect broader ties with the kingdom.
Had to Know
Congressional leaders on Sunday dismissed the story proffered earlier by the Saudis, with Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee saying they believed the crown prince was likely involved in Khashoggi’s death.
Lawmakers said they believe the U.S. must impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia or take other action if the crown prince is shown to have been involved. Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, said the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. should be formally expelled until a third-party investigation is done. He said the U.S. should call on its allies to do the same.
“Unless the Saudi kingdom understands that civilized countries around the world are going to reject this conduct and make sure that they pay a price for it, they’ll continue doing it,”’ Durbin said.
18 Detained
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman removed a top adviser to Prince Mohammed and prosecutors have detained 18 people involved in the case. Trump said Saturday he would be talking to Prince Mohammed soon.
Mnuchin is spending the week in the region with visits including Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Kuwait. The objective is to talk through enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, which go into effect Nov. 4. The Trump administration in May withdrew from a multi power nuclear agreement with Iran and is phasing in economic sanctions lifted under the 2015 accord signed during the Obama administration.“We have an important relationship with Saudi focused on terrorist financing and focused on our common interests in stopping Iran’s spread of terrorism and other issues,” Mnuchin said.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Sunday called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate a ""huge and grave mistake,"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the widening crisis, saying Mohammed bin Salman had not been aware.
The comments from Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir were some of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has given multiple and conflicting accounts about Khashoggi's killing on Oct. 2, first denying his death and later admitting it amid an international outcry.
""This was an operation that was a rogue operation. This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had,"" Jubeir said on the U.S. broadcaster Fox.
""They made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it,"" he said.
The weeks of denial and lack of credible evidence in the face of allegations from Turkish officials that Khashoggi had been killed have shaken global confidence in ties with the world's top oil exporter.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said Saudi Arabia's admission that the Washington Post columnist was killed in a fistfight was a ""good first step but not enough,"" though he added it was premature to discuss sanctions against Riyadh.
Three European powers - Germany, Britain and France - pressed Riyadh to provide facts, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while uncertainty over Khashoggi's fate persisted.
Late on Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency said both Saudi King Salman and Prince Mohammed had called Khashoggi's son, Salah, to express condolences.
Jubeir had extended condolences to Khashoggi's family earlier on Sunday. ""Unfortunately, a huge and grave mistake was made and I assure them that those responsible will be held accountable for this,"" he told Fox.
Jubeir said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi, a Saudi national and U.S. resident, had been killed or where his body was. He also said Prince Mohammed was not responsible.
Khashoggi vanished after entering the consulate to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. 
After two weeks denying any involvement in the 59-year-old's disappearance, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, died during a fight in the building. An hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold.
""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" Germany, Britain and France said in their joint statement. 
""There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened ... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible.""
The White House said late on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump had spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron and the two had discussed a range of issues including circumstances surrounding Khashoggi's death.
Reflecting international scepticism over its account, a senior Saudi government official laid out a new version that contradicts previous explanations.
The latest account includes details on how 15 Saudis sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team dressed in Khashoggi's clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate.
ERDOGAN TO SPEAK
Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate by the Saudi agents and his body cut up. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder.
In a speech on Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared to suggest he was getting ready to release some information about the Turkish investigation, and would do so at his weekly speech on Tuesday to members of his ruling AK Party.
Erdogan has remained largely silent on the case, although Turkey's pro-government newspapers have released information about events at the consulate.
Turkey's Anadolu agency said early on Monday that Erdogan and Trump had spoken on the telephone and agreed that ""all aspects"" of the case needed to be cleared up.
For Saudi Arabia's allies - particularly in the West - the question will be whether they believe that the prince, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.
""I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to the answer,"" Trump told reporters this weekend, when asked about the Saudi investigation and Riyadh's firing of officials.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said that ""obviously there's been deception, and there's been lies."" He had suggested last week that ""rogue killers"" might have been responsible for Khashoggi's death, a comment critics called an effort to play down the crisis.
A leading Republican U.S. senator said he believed the crown prince was behind the killing, adding that the Saudis had lost credibility in their explanations of his death. ""Yes, I think he did it,"" Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN, referring to the crown prince.
King Salman ordered the dismissal of five officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court adviser seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and deputy intelligence chief Ahmed Asiri, Saudi state media reported on Saturday.
The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince still retained wide-ranging authority.
Some governments and prominent executives have said they would pull out of a forthcoming investment conference in Saudi Arabia. 

According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team rolled up Khashoggi's body in a rug, took it out in a consular vehicle and handed it to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal.

Cardinal Norberto Rivera, 76, the capital's retired archbishop and an influential figure in the church for years, was inside his home at the time of the armed assault but was not harmed.
Gunfire broke out after a man wearing military clothing approached the entrance seeking to deliver a package, according to a statement from the city prosecutor. The man opened fire on a guard at the entrance but was then forced back as other guards returned fire.
The guard, whose name was not released, died as he was being transported to a nearby hospital.

Rivera retired last year, almost two decades after he was named a cardinal by Pope John Paul II.

700,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 08:00PM ET</span>",Trump Plans to Pull Out of Nuclear Weapons Pact With Russia,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he plans to pull out of a major arms control treaty with Russia, claiming the Kremlin breached the accord on intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
“We’re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement,” Trump said Saturday after a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada. “We’re going to terminate the agreement.”
Trump’s threat prompted a Russian demand for explanations, concern in Germany and a warning by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with then President Ronald Reagan in 1987. U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson was quoted as blaming Russia for the standoff.
The U.S. has been warning Russia it could resort to strong countermeasures unless Moscow complies with international commitments to arms reduction under the INF treaty, which is considered a landmark of Cold War detente.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers this month discussed concerns that Russia was developing a medium-range ballistic missile. The U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has said Russia’s non-compliance would compel the U.S. to match its capabilities to protect the interests of the U.S. and European allies.
NATO has credited the INF treaty with playing a crucial role in ensuring security for 30 years by ending the proliferation of ground-launched intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
‘Ultimatum’ Seen
Trump commented as National Security Adviser John Bolton headed to Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. In Moscow, he’s expected to meet the Russian defense and foreign ministers as a follow-up to Trump’s meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July.
Russia, which has repeatedly rejected accusations of breaching the Soviet-era treaty, expects “substantive explanations” from Bolton while he’s in Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax news agency early Sunday. For now, Russia views the U.S. position as an “ultimatum,” he was quoted as saying.
Gorbachev told Interfax that Trump’s plan is a “very weird” mistake. The treaty helped end the nuclear arms race, introducing control “that could not be found in other documents,” Gorbachev was cited as saying. “This must be cherished.”
‘Wrong Turn’
The Washington-based Arms Control Association called Trump’s decision a “self-defeating wrong turn that could lead to an unconstrained and dangerous nuclear arms competition with Russia.” The action will probably produce Cold War-style tensions over deployments of missiles, the group said in a statement.
Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said “there’s no question” Russia is violating the treaty. He suggested the Trump administration could be pursuing the same strategy it used to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
“This could be something that is just a precursor to try to get Russia to come into compliance,” Corker said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.
Trump’s plan also is causing jitters in Germany, site of peace protests in the early 1980s against the stationing of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles to counter the threat of Soviet SS-20s.
German Pleas
The announcement “raises difficult questions for Europe,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement. While Russia has failed to resolve allegations of treaty breaches, the U.S. should “reflect on the possible consequences” of a pullout, he said.
“The treaty must be upheld to prevent a nuclear arms race in Europe,” Roderich Kiesewetter, a member of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
The U.K. stands with the U.S. in “hammering home a clear message that Russia needs to respect the treaty obligation that it signed,” the Financial Times quoted defense secretary Williamson as saying during a visit to the U.S. While the U.K. wants to see the treaty continue, “it is Russia that needs to get its house in order.”
Trump and Putin may meet next month in Paris during commemorations marking 100 years since the end of World War I, or at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires that begins Nov. 30, according to a U.S. official.
(Adds arms control group, Corker starting in 10th paragraph.)"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will meet with independent lawmakers as early as Monday in a bid to shore up support for his government as it is poised to lose its one seat parliamentary majority. 
The ruling Liberal Party saw a 20 percent swing against it at a by-election in Sydney, leaving the government reliant on support of five independents to survive.
Several independent lawmakers have so far offered only qualified support for Morrison to continue, warning that their backing would be conditional on the policy changes.
Cathy McGowan, a member of the ruling government who resigned to sit as an independent, said she expects a meeting between the five lawmakers and the prime minister to happen on Monday.
""Ideally, I'd like the government to go full term, but we, the crossbenchers, will have those discussions today with the prime minister, the treasurer and various other ministers,"" McGowan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Morrison must return to the polls by May 2019.
Sources familiar with the plans of the other independent lawmakers told Reuters no meeting has yet been scheduled though talks are ongoing. A spokesman for Morrison declined to comment.
Morrison's move to meet with the independent lawmakers comes as his Liberal Party candidate maintains a slim chance of victory in the electorate of Wentworth.
Independent candidate Kerryn Phelps has a lead of more than 1,600 votes, though several thousand postal votes are still be counted.
Morrison on Saturday surrendered the seat, vacated by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull after his retirement from politics following his ousting as leader in August, though he later admitted he may have conceded too soon.

The ballot was propelled into international prominence after Morrison's late attempt to garner support from Jewish voters, who account for 13 percent of Wentworth's electorate, by suggesting Australia could recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv.

Abdul Khalik Farouk's detention came days after local media reported that draft copies of his book, ""Is Egypt Really a Poor Country?"", which includes criticism of the government's economic policies, were seized by authorities from a publisher.
A spokesman for Egypt's interior ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. Two security sources said Farouk was arrested on orders of the public prosecutor. The public prosecutor's office and the book's publisher could not immediately be reached for comment late on Sunday.
Farouk's wife told Reuters that three policemen who took him from their home in a Cairo suburb told her they were detaining him in connection with the book.
She was later allowed to deliver food, medicine and clothes to him at a local police station, she said. 
Since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in 2014, Egypt has seen a crackdown on dissent that activists say is unprecedented in the country's modern history.
Sisi's supporters say he is working to keep Egypt stable after years of political and economic turmoil following a 2011 popular uprising.

Venezuelans routinely travel to the more prosperous Aruba in search of work or staple products that have become unavailable under the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Those who are not allowed to enter Aruba often travel in rickety boats under the cover of darkness. 
Aruba's government said the pair were undocumented and that three Venezuelans had been detained in relation to the case. 
""Two people lost their life in the search for a better life,"" Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever Croes told reporters late on Saturday, adding that authorities were investigating the case. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry and Interior Ministry did not respond to a request for information. 
In a similar incident in January, four Venezuelans attempting to reach the Dutch Antilles island of Curacao died when their boat broke apart. 
As many as 1.9 million Venezuelans have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations. Combined with those who preceded them, a total of 2.6 million are believed to have left.
Given delays of months or even years to receive a passport from Venezuela's collapsing bureaucracy, many Venezuelans are now emigrating without passports, pushing them toward illegal and sometimes dangerous border crossings.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia signed a peace deal on Sunday with Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) rebels from its Somali Region, whom it had previously outlawed as a ""terrorist group,"" officials said.
The ONLF launched its bid for secession of the Somali Region, also known as Ogaden, in eastern Ethiopia in 1984. In 2007, Ethiopian forces launched a large-scale offensive against the group after the rebels killed 74 people in an attack on a Chinese-run oil facility.
Earlier this year, parliament removed the ONLF from a list of banned movements as part of a reform drive being led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has extended an olive branch to opponents. The ONLF declared a ceasefire in August.
The agreement, seen by Reuters, stipulates that both sides would end hostilities and that the ONLF would ""pursue its political obligations through peaceful means"".
The two sides will now form a joint committee to discuss the root causes of the conflict, the agreement said.
The Ogaden region contains four trillion cubic feet of gas and oil deposits, the government says. China's POLY-GCL Petroleum has been developing two gas fields there since 2013.
Abiy, who took office in April, is presiding over a push to shake the Horn of Africa nation of 100 million people from decades of security-obsessed rule.
He has acknowledged and condemned widespread abuses by the security forces, likening the situation to state terrorism, and he has worked to forge peace with Eritrea, with which Addis Ababa has been locked in a military standoff since a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died.

(Reuters) - A lioness has killed the father of her three offspring, suffocating her mate by locking her jaws onto his neck at the Indianapolis Zoo in an attack not fully understood by zoo staff.
The lions had been held together at the zoo for eight years, producing three cubs in 2015, and zookeepers had never before noticed any aggression between the two, the zoo said in a statement issued on Friday.
The death devastated zookeepers and the cause may never be understood, the curator of the zoo said.
""They build strong bonds with the animals so any loss affects us all greatly. For a lot of us, it's just like a family member,"" David Hagan, curator of the Indianapolis Zoo, said in an interview.
Zoo staff were alerted by ""an unusual amount of roaring"" coming from the lion pen on Monday and arrived to find the 12-year-old female lion Zuri in a fight with the 10-year-old male lion Nyack, the zoo said in a statement.
""She had Nyack by the neck. Keepers came up and saw what was occurring and made an attempt to separate the two. But she continued to hang onto Nyack by the neck until he stopped moving,"" Hagan said.
A necropsy found that Nyack died of suffocation from injuries to the neck.
The lioness had been on loan from the San Diego Zoo as part of the Species Survival Plan managed by Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
The incident was under review but there were no plans to change how the lions would be managed, the zoo said. 
One of their offspring, a 3-year-old female named Sukari, was in the outdoor lion pen at the time, while the two male offspring were kept in a separate part of the exhibit.

Zookeepers began separating the males earlier this year, corresponding the age they typically leave the pride, at 2 or 3, when they are considered young adults, Hagan said.

The two men taken into custody by Israel were Adnan Gheith, who holds the largely ceremonial post of Palestinian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, and Jihad Al-Faqeeh, the head of Palestinian intelligence in the city.
They are suspected of having assisted in abducting a resident of Jerusalem two weeks ago, who has since been held by the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, their lawyers said. Both men deny the charges, they said.
Israeli police said only that the two have been remanded until Tuesday.
The Palestinian Authority condemned what it said was an ""abduction"" of the two Palestinian officials, but it did not comment on the specifics of the charges.
Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called in a statement for the release of the two officials.
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after its capture in the 1967 war and regards the entire city as its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.
According to a report on Israel's Reshet 13 television, the Palestinian resident of Jerusalem abducted two weeks ago has both an Israeli identity card and U.S. citizenship.
He was wanted by the Palestinian Authority, the report said, for helping sell property in Jerusalem's old city to Jewish buyers.
Asked about the report, a U.S. embassy spokesperson said: ""We are aware of reports that a U.S. citizen has been detained by the Palestinian Authority. When a U.S. citizen is incarcerated or detained overseas, the Department of State works to provide all appropriate consular assistance.""
The spokesperson declined to elaborate, citing privacy issues.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Court of Appeal has ordered the office of Santiago's Archbishop to pay $450 million pesos ($650,000) to three men who alleged they were sexually abused for decades by Chilean priest Fernando Karadima, a local newspaper reported on Sunday. 
Citing a copy of a leaked judgment, La Tercera said the three judges who heard the case on Thursday found in favor of an appeal for ""moral damages"" against the church for allegedly covering up the crimes. The case was previously rejected by a lower court for lack of evidence.
Reuters could not independently confirm the report. The Santiago Archbishopric, which could appeal to Chile's Supreme Court, said it was considering ""what steps to take."" 
If confirmed by the court on Monday, it would be the first damages order to have been leveled against Chile's powerful Roman Catholic Church for a scandal of sex abuse and cover-up that prompted Pope Francis to apologize to its faithful. 
Legal experts have said it could pave the way for more claims amid a new climate of discovery which has seen hundreds of people come forward to allege they were abused and criminal prosecutors launch scores of new investigations. 
In a statement hailing the reported verdict, claimants James Hamilton, Jose Andres Murillo and Juan Carlos Cruz - who were invited to Rome earlier this year to tell the Pope about their alleged abuse - said it was the culmination of a ""journey that was long and painful, but worth it"". 
""We are witnessing an important cultural shift, in which the abuses of the powerful are beginning to be seen as unacceptable, and Justice is confirming that,"" they said.
Their lawyer, Juan Pablo Hermosilla, told Reuters they believed the report was credible but added: ""I don't have official confirmation yet."" 
Karadima worked for the Santiago Archbishopric as a parish priest in the wealthy suburb of El Bosque for 21 years between 1985 to 2006. 
Now 88 and living in a nursing home in the capital, Karadima has always denied accusations of abuse. He was never charged by civilian authorities because the statute of limitations on such crimes had expired. He was found guilty of sexual abuse in a Vatican investigation in 2011, and last month was defrocked by the Pope.
Hermosilla said that since the case was rejected by a lower court, new evidence had emerged including an email written in 2009 from a former archbishop, Cardinal Francisco Errazuriz, to the then papal nuncio that was read to the court on Thursday.
In the email, Errazuriz described the trio of accusers as ""aggressive"" and said he was closing the case against Karadima.
In a statement responding to the report of a verdict, the Santiago Archbishopric said it did not know the court's ruling, but that it would have to study it and recent developments in the case before deciding how to act.

""We must analyze the situation, together with the ruling, to resolve what steps to take,"" the archbishopric's statement said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's leading presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro said on Sunday that, if he is elected, he intends to use the armed forces for routine street patrols, describing the country as ""at war.""
The far-right lawmaker and former army captain said in an interview with Band TV that he would discuss the idea with his proposed defense minister and state governments, which are responsible for public safety.
""If Congress grants permission, I would put armed forces in the streets,"" Bolsonaro said.
A 63-year-old, seven-term congressman who openly defends Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, Bolsonaro is widely expected to win the presidency this month. Opinion polls show him leading his leftist rival Fernando Haddad by 18 percentage points just a week ahead of the Oct. 28 second-round vote. 
Scrambling to make up the difference, Haddad on Sunday pledged to increase benefits paid under Brazil's top social assistance program, known as Bolsa Família, by 20 percent.
Bolsonaro, a polarizing candidate who has been charged with hate speech for his comments regarding gays, blacks and women, has pitched himself as the anti-establishment choice, appealing to voters fed up with political corruption and violent crime.
In August 2017, a year after Rio de Janeiro hosted the Olympic Games, the federal government dispatched 8,500 soldiers to quell violent crime in the city. But military officials said from the outset that they would not be the ones to resolve issues underpinning the urban violence. 
On Sunday thousands of supporters took part in rallies for Bolsonaro in Brazil's major cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília.
That followed women-led protests against him on Saturday, for the second time in a month.

Joachim Roenneberg, serving behind enemy lines in his native Norway during the German occupation, in 1943 blew up a plant producing heavy water, or D2O, a hydrogen-rich substance that was key to the later development of atomic bombs.
Picked by Britain's war-time Special Operations Executive to lead the raid when he was only 23 years old, Roenneberg was the youngest member of Operation Gunnerside, which penetrated and destroyed key parts of the heavily guarded Norsk Hydro plant.
The subject of books and documentaries as well as movies and a TV drama series, the attack took place without a single shot fired.
To Roenneberg's team, however, the stakes could not have been higher. An earlier raid failed to even reach the site, with dozens of attackers captured and killed, and Gunnerside members later described their own assault as a near-suicide mission.
Parachuting onto a snow-covered mountain plateau, the small group teamed up with a handful of other commando soldiers before skiing to their destination, penetrating the plant on foot and blowing up the heavy water production line.
Describing a pivotal moment, Roenneberg later said he made a last-minute decision to cut the length of his fuse from several minutes to seconds, ensuring the explosion would take place but making it more difficult to escape.
While a manhunt ensued, the group fled hundreds of kilometers across the mountains, with Roenneberg skiing to neighboring Sweden, a neutral country in the war, two weeks later.
While historians doubt that Adolf Hitler's Germany would have been able to produce a nuclear weapon in time to stave off defeat, they also recognize that the risks were much harder to quantify in 1943.
For the Gunnerside crew, this hardly mattered at the time; only much later did they learn the true purpose of the attack they were asked to carry out.
Born in 1919 in the town of Aalesund, Roenneberg fled to Britain after the German invasion of Norway in 1940, receiving military training before returning home for several missions during the war.
After the 1945 liberation he became a radio reporter but rarely spoke of his wartime achievements. Later in life he gave speeches and lectures well into his nineties, warning against the destructive force of totalitarianism. 
Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg on Sunday praised Roenneberg for his work both during and after the war.

""He is one of our great heroes,"" she told news agency NTB.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes killed 41 people, including 10 children, in al-Sousa village and its environs on Thursday and Friday. Many were Iraqi relatives of Islamic State fighters, the UK-based monitor said. 
The coalition raids, which hit a mosque and houses, also killed 22 jihadists around the Euphrates River near the Iraqi border, one of the last Islamic State enclaves in Syria. 
Syria's foreign ministry said on Saturday that coalition warplanes had ""committed a crime"", killing at least 62 civilians in al-Sousa and a nearby village in Deir al-Zor province. 
Damascus, which deems the U.S. and international forces in Syria occupiers, accused them of relentless bombing and called on the United Nations to ""punish the aggressors"".
The U.S.-led coalition said it destroyed a mosque which Islamic State fighters had turned into a headquarters in al-Sousa to defend their last territory.
The strike on Thursday killed 12 militants, disabling a command center they had used to attack coalition forces and their allies, it said. 
""Such Daesh misuse of the mosque is another example of their violation of the law of war and made the mosque a valid military target,"" spokesman Colonel Sean Ryan said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. 
The coalition monitored the facility to know when only fighters were present, and it investigates ""all credible allegations of civilian casualties"", he said in an emailed statement in response to questions from Reuters. 
The U.S.-led coalition is fighting the remnants of Islamic State near the frontier between Syria and Iraq. With air power and special forces on the ground, it backs the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance of militias.
Various rival offensives have crushed Islamic State in most of the territory it controlled in both countries, though fighters still operate in the desert near the border and stage attacks.

Under the treaty, Israel retained private land ownership and special travel rights in Baquora in the northwestern part of the kingdom and Ghumar in the south.
King Abdullah, who has been under increasing public pressure to end the leasing arrangements with Israel, told senior politicians the kingdom wanted to exercise its ""full sovereignty"" over the two areas, Petra state news agency said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday his country will negotiate with Jordan an extension of the 25-year lease. [J7N1RM01W]
Netanyahu, in public remarks, said Jordan wants to implement its option to end the lease, and Israel ""will enter negotiations with it on the possibility of extending the current arrangement"".
Under an annex to the peace agreement, Israel leased about 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of agricultural land in the southern sector of its border with Jordan, as well as a small area known as the ""Island of Peace"" near the Sea of Galilee.
The 25-year lease expires next year.
Under the terms of peace treaty, the lease would be automatically renewed unless either of the parties notified the other a year before expiry that it wished to terminate the agreement, according to a Foreign Ministry statement.

The woman was standing in a long line waiting for food handout at Greece's biggest migrant camp in Moria on the Aegean island of Lesbos, when the police officer insulted her using offensive language. 
The police said it would carry out an internal inquiry into the incident for racism and will also examine whether three other police officers shown in the video should also be suspended.
The three officers were standing nearby but took no action. 
Attacks on migrants have been creeping up in Greece which is struggling to cope with thousands of people stranded in overcrowded camps since a migrant crisis broke out in 2015.
The Moria camp has long been described by the United Nations and other human rights organizations as overcrowded and unfit for humans. More than 7,300 refugees and migrants are currently in the former military camp in a collection of shipping containers and flimsy tents, more than double its 3,100-person capacity, according to the latest government figures.
To ease overcrowding, authorities have begun moving hundreds to facilities on the mainland.

Athens-based NGO Racist Violence Recording Network has said the poor living conditions of refugees and migrants on Greek islands were fuelling xenophobic rhetoric in local communities, sometimes with ""extreme manifestations"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could accept extending the post-Brexit transition period by a few months if the European Union drops its proposals for a so-called Northern Irish backstop, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday.
Talks between Britain and the EU have stalled largely over a disagreement on the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
The Brexit transition, or implementation period, in which Britain would retain EU rules and so avoid border problems with Ireland, is due to end in December 2020.
""If we need a bridge from the end of the implementation period to the future relationship ... I am open minded about using a short extension of the implementation period,"" Raab told BBC TV.
""It is an obvious possible route as long as it is short, perhaps a few months, and secondly that we know how we get out of it and obviously it has to solve the backstop issue so that that falls away then as a possibility.""
In an interview published on Sunday, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier stood firm on the need for checks on goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit, but insisted this would not amount to a new border. 
Britain says the EU's backstop proposal of keeping Northern Ireland in its customs union is unacceptable as it would create a border in the Irish Sea. It favors a backstop in which the whole of Britain would stay inside the customs union but says it must be time-limited period or have a clear exit mechanism.
France's Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the EU was still waiting for ""a workable solution"" from London.
""We have to have a definite answer, or at least no temporary measures which disappear and we don’t know what to do after that,"" she told BBC TV. 
""LAST CHANCE SALOON"" 
The possibility of extending the transition, keeping Britain under EU governance with no say in it, is highly unpopular with hardline supporters of Brexit and after Prime Minister Theresa May signaled it as a possibility this week, her critics used the Sunday newspapers to step up their attacks.
The Sunday Times reported an ally of former Brexit minister David Davis, who some see as an interim leader if May goes, as saying the British leader was entering ""the killing zone"", while it quoted an unnamed possible successor as saying ""assassination is in the air"".
The Mail on Sunday reported lawmakers from May's Conservatives said she was in the ""last chance saloon"" and should ""bring her own noose"" when she addresses Conservative lawmakers at a meeting in parliament on Wednesday.
A vote of no confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative's lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the party's so-called ""1922 committee"" of backbenchers demanding such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
""We are at the end stage of the negotiation. I think it is understandable there are jitters on all sides of this debate, we need to hold our nerve, the end is in sight in terms of a good deal ... I think colleagues should wait and see what that looks like,"" said Raab. ""Now is the time to play for the team.""
Raab said he did not know when he would next be going to Brussels to negotiate, but a deal needed to be done by the end of November in order to get the legislation through parliament.
Opposition Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said that even if a deal was agreed before Christmas it may not last.

""This idea that there will be a settlement, the issue will be over,"" he said. ""What we are going to see is even if there is a deal the Tory (Conservative) Party will try to rip it up next year ... they will not stop fighting about this.""

722,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>",Israel puts West Bank Bedouin village eviction on hold for several weeks,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Sunday it would put on hold for ""a number of weeks"" its threatened razing of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank amid international calls to drop the plan, saying it would try to negotiate an evacuation.
The decision was announced after a meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet.
Israel, which has long sought to clear the Arab nomads from tracts of land between the Jewish settlements of Maale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, has said the hamlet of Khan al-Ahmar was built without the required permits.
Palestinians, who lost an Israeli Supreme Court appeal against the evacuation, say such documents are impossible to obtain.
The European Union and the United Nations have urged Israel to abandon the plan to demolish Khan al-Ahmar and relocate its 180 residents to an area about 12 km (seven miles) away next to a landfill in the West Bank.
Foreign pressure was ramped up on Wednesday when the International Criminal Court prosecutor said in a statement about Khan al-Ahmar that population transfers in occupied territory constitute war crimes. Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war.
""The security cabinet is allowing an extension of a number of weeks for negotiations on a consensual evacuation to be exhausted,"" ,"" the Israeli statement said. 
Israeli authorities have been expected to send in bulldozers at any time after an Oct. 1 deadline for the villagers to demolish their own homes expired. Pro-Palestinian foreign activists have flocked to the site.
In remarks to reporters earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu echoed a statement on Saturday by an official in his office who said the eviction had been postponed and an alternative relocation plan was being considered, in coordination with the Palestinian Authority.
But Netanyahu said the demolition would not be delayed indefinitely.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry, commenting on those remarks in statement, dismissed the postponement as ""nothing more than an Israeli attempt to calm foreign and local criticism"".
The Palestinians say razing Khan al-Ahmar's tents and tin shacks is part of an Israeli plan to create an arc of Jewish settlements that could effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, areas occupied by Israel since a 1967 war.

Most countries consider settlements built by Israel on land it captured in 1967 as illegal and say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state. Israel disputes this.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that many of the country's heroes from World War Two had been deliberately ignored, with his comments interpreted by many as an attack on the opposition Congress Party. 
In a speech in front of Delhi's historic Red Fort, Modi said that Subhas Chandra Bose, one of the key figures in India's battle for independence from Britain, had been marginalized in modern India. 
""In an effort to highlight the role of one family, efforts were made to deliberately ignore and forget others in the independence struggle,"" Modi said in a thinly-veiled reference to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated India's Congress Party for the past seven decades, including its time in power. 
Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi is the great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India's first Prime Minister. Rahul Gandhi's father, Rajiv, and his grandmother, Indira, have also led the country. 
The party disputed Modi's characterization.
""When distortion of history is the norm, need to put out facts that are sacred,"" said Priyanka Chaturvedi, a Congress spokeswoman in a tweet, noting that Nehru and Bose had a strong relationship. 
Modi was speaking at an event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind provisional government, formed in Japanese-occupied Singapore in 1943 with the support of Nazi Germany and its allies in the Second World War. Bose, the leader of that government, played an influential role in ending British rule in India in 1947. 
Facing a series of state elections next month before a general election due by May, Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have been reaching back into history to build up heroes other than the Nehru-Gandhi family, many of them within the Congress party. 
Modi, the son of a tea stall owner from one of India's lower castes, said in April that B.R. Ambedkar, one of the founding fathers of the Indian constitution and was drawn from the lowest of the Hindu caste hierarchy, was a personal inspiration. 

At the end of the month Modi plans to unveil the world's largest statue - of another Congress leader, Vallabhbhai Patel.

Negotiations on Britain's departure from the European Union are stalled on several issues, but primarily an Irish 'backstop' both sides agree is needed to avoid a hard border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, an EU state.
Brussels insists that this in turn requires controls on goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, and is trying to overcome objections from among UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives and the Northern Ireland Unionists crucial to her government's parliamentary majority.
""Contrary to what some are saying, this is not a border we are creating in the Irish Sea to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom,"" Barnier told Le Journal du Dimanche.
Veterinary checks are already conducted on 10 percent of livestock transported to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, Barnier said. This would increase to 100 percent under the backstop, he added, but a later animal-health agreement could reduce the proportion inspected to 40 percent.
Barnier said other backstop measures were needed to prevent unauthorized Irish imports of goods such as chlorinated chicken, produced in the U.S. but outlawed by EU food standards.

He said other issues still preventing a deal include the demand by Brussels that the European Court of Justice should have jurisdiction over its implementation - as well as Britain's reluctance to address registered designations of origin for foodstuffs, such as champagne or Roquefort cheese.

AMRITSAR, India (Reuters) - An angry mob threw stones at police on Sunday near the site of a deadly railway accident in north India, demanding immediate financial compensation for the families of the victims and government jobs for those who lost wage-earners.
A group of about 100 people staged the protest in the northern city of Amritsar where a train plowed through a crowd gathered to watch the burning of effigies and a fireworks display on Friday as part of a Hindu festival, killing 59.
Many of the victims were either on the railway tracks or near them and did not hear the commuter train coming in the noise of the crackers and giant effigies burning in the darkness, witnesses and officials said. 
Relatives of the victims have turned on the railways for allowing the train to go through when there were scores of people near the tracks. The railways said they were not informed about the plans and that people should not have been standing near the tracks.
On Sunday, relatives and locals gathered at the accident site and began throwing stones at police, saying there was no help coming for the grief-stricken families.
""Down with the government,"" a youth shouted, while others lunged toward police constables guarding the site, where an inquiry has been ordered. 
""They should give the close relatives of the dead and the injured government jobs. They should also make sure they get the compensation quickly. Nobody has received anything till now,"" said Ravinder, one of the protesters who only gave his first name.
Police charged at the stone pelting mob with sticks to disperse them.
Amarinder Singh, the chief minister of Punjab, the state where the accident took place, announced compensation of 500,000 Indian rupees ($6,815) for those who lost family members and free treatment for those injured in the accident. 
But such compensation often takes months or even longer in reaching the families. 
SHOPS SHUT
Shops were shut across Amritsar, to mourn the victims of the latest disaster to hit the railways, one of the most deadly in years. 
Data from parliament in July showed that 49,790 people were killed by trains in India between 2015 and 2017.
A railways official said the driver of the train told authorities he had applied brakes and honked on sighting the crowd near the tracks, but was not able to stop the train on time. 
Amrit Singh, the director of the railway station at Amritsar, said a commuter train traveling at 90 km per hour (56 miles per hour) would travel for 700 meters (765 yards) after the brakes are applied before stopping.

""In this case, the driver had just 200 meters, or less. There is no way he could have stopped the train,"" Singh said.

The men were charged with breaking electronic information law by creating and transmitting pornographic content, a crime that carries a maximum sentence of six years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of one billion rupiah ($66,000).
Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in the conservative province of Aceh, but the country has seen an increase in raids targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, forcing many members of the community underground.
Hari Brata, the deputy director at the West Java police directorate of special crimes, said the suspects, identified by their initials IS and IH, were arrested on Thursday.
""So far, we're still developing [the case],"" Brata said, declining to comment further.
The men being held have allegedly managed a Facebook account named ""Gay Bandung Indonesia"" since 2015 and the group has 4,093 members, the police said on an Instagram account.
Gay rights activists say the hostility often shown toward the LGBT community will backfire, by undermining Indonesia's battle against AIDS.

The proposed cabinet changes come as the government faces intense pressure over the economic instability mostly caused by U.S. sanctions. The economy has markedly deteriorated in the past year, suffering rising inflation and unemployment, a slump in the rial currency and state corruption.
Rouhani also appointed a new urban development and roads minister, an industry, mines, and trade minister, and a new labor minister. 
Mohammad Shariatmadari, the outgoing industries minister, has been nominated to head the Labour, Cooperatives and Social Affairs Ministry.
Mohammad Eslami was named to head the Urban Development and Roads Ministry, and Reza Rahmani, who has earlier headed the parliament's commission on mining and industry, was named as the new industry, mines, and trade minister.
Dejpasand, the proposed economy minister, has also worked as deputy head of the state Plan and Budget Organization, among other postings.
Washington reintroduced sanctions against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after the U.S. withdrawal from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. curbs on Iran’s vital oil exports are set to come into force in November.
Earlier this year, anger over the government's handling of the economy erupted into public protests across Iran. Some turned violent and at least 25 people were killed. Hundreds were arrested but officials say most have been released. 
The International Monetary Fund predicts that Iran's economy would shrink 1.5 percent this year following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions with a drop of 3.6 percent seen in 2019, before recovering slowly.

State media said parliament was expected to discuss the nominations and vote on the new proposed ministers on Saturday.

Zheng Xiaosong, the head of China's liaison office to Macau, had been suffering from depression, the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Chinese government's State Council said in a statement, adding representatives of the Beijing government visited Macau to offer condolences. The statement did not elaborate further on the circumstances of his death.
Zheng, 59, was appointed to the Macau post in September 2017 and is a member of the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee, the largest of China's elite ruling bodies. He was previously the vice governor of the southeastern coastal province of Fujian. 
The liaison office in Macau serves as a bridge between the local government and Beijing and has become increasingly influential in local affairs. 
Like neighboring Hong Kong, Macau operates under China's ""one country, two systems"" policy and is ruled by a chief executive, who is chosen via an election but must get approval from Beijing to formally take office. 
Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui said in a statement that he was ""shocked"" about Zheng's death and expressed condolences. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam also issued a statement expressing ""deep sorrow"" for Zheng's death. 

A statement published on Friday on the Macau liaison's office website showed that Zheng met with the head of a think tank the day before his death. During the meeting he emphasized the importance of supporting the local government and the one country, two systems policy to ensure Macau's continued development, the statement said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The pregnant wife of Britain's Prince Harry, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will cut back her busy schedule as the royal couple enter the last week-and-a-half of their tour to Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific.
Meghan curtailed her activities after attending the opening ceremony for the Invictus Games on Saturday night at Sydney's Opera House. A thunderstorm delayed the opening for more than an hour but did not dampen the spirits of competitors from 18 nations who watched a musician play a didgeridoo in a traditional Aboriginal welcoming ceremony.
""You are the role models to us all, and you are going to put on one hell of a show over the next week,"" Prince Harry told the competitors in his address.
The Invictus Games are athletic competitions involving wounded military personnel and have been credited for fostering hope and resilience in people traumatized during conflict.
""Be inspired, get excited. Allow the example of service and determination that you all see to change something big or small in your own lives,"" said Prince Harry to rousing applause from 500 athletes and a supportive crowd that filled the Opera House stairs, according to video of the speech on the British royal family's Twitter account.
However, Meghan took a break from the Invictus Games events on Sunday morning though Harry watched a cycling competition.
""After a busy program, the Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchess's schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week-and-a-half of the tour,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement reported by Australia's SBS news.
The Duchess was back on deck at lunch time, welcomed by Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison at an Invictus Games reception for competitors and mental health organization representatives.
""You’ve all come together today to join together as a community to give testimony to that great Australian spirit about how we look after each other as mates,"" Morrison said in his address which was televised on the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
During the reception, the Duke and Duchess met with children from the Kookaburra Kids Foundation which supports families affected by mental illness, the Endeavour Clontarf Academy which helps disadvantaged indigenous men, and cadets from the Royal Australian Air Force.
The royal couple will travel on Monday to Queensland's Fraser Island on the north-east coast of Australia before leaving for Tonga and Fiji later in the week. 

On Friday, they will return to Sydney for the final days of the Invictus Games before flying home via New Zealand.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>","Australian by-election count goes to the wire, after PM concedes","By Alison Bevege and Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - As the count from a crucial Australian by-election spilled into Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced the possibility that his Liberal party may have been too quick to concede a contest that would relegate his administration to a minority government.
Morrison became Australia's sixth prime minister in 10 years in August after his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull fell victim to infighting among the Liberals, and the suspense over the count in the by-election for Sydney's Wentworth constituency were in keeping with the unpredictable politics of recent times.
On Saturday, Morrison had surrendered the seat, previously held by Turnbull, after the early count showed a swing of more than 20 percent away from the Liberals. But with a quarter of the ballots still to be counted on Sunday the Liberal candidate was just 900 votes behind.
The contest had gathered international attention after Morrison's late attempt to garner support from Jewish voters, who account for 13 percent of Wentworth's electorate, by suggesting Australia could recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv.
What impact that gambit had was unclear, but with his parliamentary majority hanging by a thread as the count continued, Morrison acknowledged that whatever the outcome, voters were clearly disillusioned with his party.
""The gap has closed by several hundred votes. There are still many postal votes to be counted,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney. ""But, that said, yesterday Liberal voters expressed their anger.""
Morrison said if the vote gets as close as 100 votes an automatic recount would be triggered, giving his conservative coalition a slender chance of retaining its one seat majority in parliament.
The Liberals poor showing was partly attributable to Wentworth voters disillusion with the way party rebels had dumped Turnbull, said Morrison.
Should the Liberals lose the by-election, Morrison's government will probably have to rely on support from independent lawmakers to survive the next few months, as a general election is due by May next year.
Kerryn Phelps, the independent candidate who held the lead in the race for Wentworth, offered cold comfort to the ruling coalition.

""All governments should go full term unless there are exceptional circumstances,"" Phelps told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Sunday.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghans unable to vote in Saturday's parliamentary election after hundreds of polling stations failed to open were given another chance to cast their ballot on Sunday after voting times were extended despite security threats and warnings of fraud.
Around three million Afghans voted on Saturday, election officials said but across the country there were complaints that polling stations remained closed, often because staff failed to turn up.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan issued a statement saying it was encouraged by the high numbers who voted on Saturday, many of whom endured long delays due to technical and organizational problems.
""Those eligible voters who were not able to cast their vote, due to technical issues, deserve the right to vote,"" it said.
The Sunday extension was made for 401 polling stations, and 500 extra officials were deployed.
Many independent election observers, seen as an important check on efforts to manipulate the result, have been reluctant to work, fearing militant attacks.
""It is not an ideal scenario,"" one foreign security official said, noting the extra pressure placed on already stretched security forces which have been on high alert following Taliban warnings that they would target the election.
Over 120 incidents involving hand grenades or improvised explosive devices were reported on Saturday and scores of people were killed or wounded across the country. In one incident, 15 people were killed by a suicide bomber who tried to enter a polling station in Kabul, but overall the violence was not as bad as some officials had feared.
The vote for the lower house of parliament is seen as a test ahead of next year's more important presidential election but the run-up was marred by chaotic preparations, accusations of cheating and threats of militant violence.
Almost 9 million voters were registered but many of these, as much as 50 percent or more according to some estimates, may have been fraudulently recorded.
More than a million people voted in the capital Kabul but turnout was very low in the provinces, said Naeem Ayubzada, director of Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan, a civic action body that has been monitoring the ballot.
He said the decision to extend the vote, which was taken unexpectedly as complaints mounted on Saturday, opened the way for abuse, with half-filled ballot boxes left open all night in some polling centers.
""From a planning point of view, it's very difficult,"" he said. ""It provides an opportunity for fraud.""
The result of the election is not expected to be known for at least two weeks due to the difficulty in counting and collating the results.

In addition, voting in the province of Kandahar was delayed by a week following the assassination of the powerful local police commander Gen. Abdul Razeq. The election in the central province of Ghazni was also postponed due to disagreements over the representation of different ethnic groups.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 11:24PM ET</span>",North Korea's box of bones: A mythical king and the dream of Korean unification,"By Josh Smith and Jeongmin Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - It's the stuff of an Indiana Jones movie: supernatural kings, ancient tombs, and government-backed archaeologists striving to harness the power of legend for a greater cause. 
On a divided Korean peninsula, tales of King Dangun - the mythical founder of the first Korean kingdom more than 4,350 years ago - play a quiet but persistent role in keeping the dream of reunification alive.
This mythology made an appearance in September when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took South Korean President Moon Jae-in to the top of Mount Paektu, the supposed birthplace of Dangun.
Moon also invoked the legend in an unprecedented speech in Pyongyang, calling for Korea to be reunited.
""We had lived together for 5,000 years but apart for just 70 years,"" said Moon, whose parents came from what is now North Korea.
For many South Koreans, the idea of unification has become increasingly unrealistic amid a widening gulf between the two Koreas more than 70 years after they were partitioned in the wake of World War II.
The legend of Dangun, however, plays a lasting role in promoting unification because it portrays Koreans as a homogenous group destined to live together, said Jeong Young-Hun, a professor at Seoul's Academy of Korean Studies. 
""Dangun is a basis for Koreans to feel the necessity for pursuing harmony and unification,"" he said. ""Dangun is a basis for seeing unification as something possible.""
There’s little evidence for the glorious king or the thousands of years of Korean unity Dangun is said to have founded. 
Still, that hasn’t stopped North Korea from claiming to have found his tomb and South Korea from eulogizing the unity of a kingdom that once challenged the might of China’s dynasties. 
""In both Koreas, (Dangun) has been used to emphasize the uniqueness, the singularity, homogeneity and antiquity of the Korean people,"" said Michael Seth, a professor of Korean history at James Madison University in Virginia. ""Whether a real person or not, he is used by both Koreas to emphasize the unity as well as the uniqueness of the Korean people.""
NORTH KOREA'S BOX OF BONES
Scholars say the chances that Dangun actually existed are close to zero.
According to Korean legend, Dangun was the son of a god who wanted to be a man, and a bear who wanted to be a woman.
""Dangun is a myth,"" said Yeungnam University archaeologist Lee Chung Kyu. 
North Korea's founders originally disdained the story of Dangun as superstition incompatible with their ostensibly socialist ideology. 
However, officials have since gone to great lengths to capitalize on the mythology and cement the ruling Kim family's claim to Dangun's legacy.
Official North Korean narratives have claimed Mount Paektu as the ""sacred mountain of revolution"" and assert that Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, was born on its slopes. Many historians place his actual birthplace in the former Soviet Union.
In the mid-1990s, North Korean authorities announced they had discovered the tomb of Dangun and his wife just outside Pyongyang, going so far as to ""reconstruct"" a white stone pyramid flanked by rough-hewn obelisks and statues of ancient princes and snarling beasts.
At the time, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung said constructing the mausoleum was designed to demonstrate “that Korea has a history spanning 5,000 years, that the Koreans are a homogeneous nation of the same blood since their emergence,” according to a state media article from 2015.
For 100 euros each, or about $115, tourists can peek inside a glass box containing what the North Koreans say are the bones of Dangun and his wife.
The high price and a reputation as an underwhelming experience mean few visitors pay to see the bones, Western tour guides say.
Amid a previous temporary thaw in relations between the two Koreas in 2007, a delegation led by South Korea's defense minister visited Dangun's royal tomb, and Pyongyang gave permission for South Korean tourists to visit Mount Paektu.
""A COMMON DESTINY""
Unlike Dangun, there is more evidence for Gojoseon, the kingdom he purportedly founded.
Seoul's National Museum of Korea has a display of bronze daggers, ceramics, and other relics said to be from the period and credited as ""the first state ever to emerge on the Korean Peninsula"".
Signs at the museum say Gojoseon lasted from 2,333 BCE to 108 BCE and ""was powerful enough to compete as equals"" with major dynasties in China. However, historians say details are disputed and have often been manipulated for political purposes.
""The early part of Gojoseon cannot be recognized as a state, especially not as a homogenous ethnic nation-state,"" said Yeungnam University's Lee, who argues the period was more likely marked by chiefdoms or tribes that only much later formed a more unified kingdom.
The idea of Dangun became especially popular among Koreans suffering under Japanese colonial occupation from 1910 to 1945, leading to the establishment of a home-grown religious movement that continues today.
The myth has sometimes been misused, leading to ""chauvinism and extreme nationalism,"" Lee said. 
Still, Dangun makes his mark in both Koreas.
During the national Foundation Day holiday on October 3, hundreds of South Koreans gathered at shrines in Seoul to make offerings, wear masks depicting a bearded Dangun, and rally for a peaceful and united Korea.
On the same day in North Korea, senior unification officials visited the mausoleum to perform an ""ancestral sacrifice for Dangun"" and call for a unified Korea.
Jeong said the unifying themes of Dangun and Gojoseon are ""imperative"" as the two Koreas try to overcome their differences.
""The most important ground for justifying unification can be found in the idea that we are a homogeneous group bound together by a common destiny – that we have lived as one throughout history and we have to continue to do so in the future,” he said.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 07:26PM ET</span>",Polish regional vote a test for eurosceptic PiS government,"By Pawel Florkiewicz and Pawel Sobczak
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poles vote in a regional election on Sunday with gains expected for the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party, whose nationalist rhetoric and institutional reforms have fueled a deepening rift with the European Union. 
PiS swept into power in 2015 on a promise of voter-pleasing welfare bumps, social conservatism and more state say in the economy. The party remains broadly popular, despite accusations at home and abroad of a shift toward authoritarian rule.
The election is part of a larger struggle over Europe's future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban, a PiS ally, shake up the European Union and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
While it dominates national politics, PiS controls a small minority of city halls, and has a majority in only one provincial assembly out of 16.
If successful in gaining seats, PiS will have better access to local funding, a factor which could affect parliamentary elections in 2019. It will also have more influence over schools and theaters, important tools in the party's nationalist agenda.
PiS opposes abortion, contraception and IVF fertility treatment and wants culture and education to be more conservative.
""Dear citizens, if you want more money to reach here for infrastructure and industry, then vote for PiS candidates,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told voters during a rally in Kielce in southern Poland on Oct. 13. 
Opinion polls show PiS could win 33-37 percent of votes for provincial assembly members. A coalition of centrist opposition parties, the Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, is forecast to capture about 24 percent of the vote. Post-election coalitions could affect how many assemblies PiS will control.
The centrist candidate for Warsaw mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, is seen winning 41-42 percent of vote on Sunday, and securing the office in a second round of voting on Nov. 4, beating PiS' Patryk Jaki, 33.
A spike in PiS support in cities, traditionally centrist strongholds, would show its brand of populism gaining broader appeal and would be a major upset for the Civic Platform, the home party of European Council President Donald Tusk. 
""DISAPPOINTING EU""
A good result for PiS would add to concerns in Brussels ahead of European Parliament elections in May by boosting eurosceptic groups that oppose efforts at closer EU integration.
Underlining divisions, the EU's top court ordered the Warsaw government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the country's Supreme Court and reinstate judges forced into early retirement.
The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary, which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and efficient, but opponents criticize as an attack on democratic checks and balances.
Throughout his campaign, Warsaw's mayoral candidate Jaki said he sides with ordinary people against what he describes as an arrogant Civic Platform municipal elite.
Trzaskowski, a long-time EU emissary for his party, says he wants his native Warsaw to remain ""open, tolerant and European"". 
He accuses the PiS-run justice ministry, where Jaki is a deputy minister and which is at the heart of the government's conflict with Brussels over court reforms, of policies that could lead Poland to leaving the EU.
""It's a straight road toward taking Poland out of the EU,"" he said on Wednesday.
Like Orban's Fidesz party in Hungary, PiS argues the powers of Brussels should be reined in, and accuses EU institutions of meddling in Poland's internal affairs.
""It's depressing that the EU is so engaged in our politics. I don't think it should,"" said Agnieszka Zdziuch, a 44-year-old office worker in the town of Staszow in southern Poland.

Voting starts at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and ends at 9 p.m., exit poll results are expected shortly afterwards.

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) came first in a parliamentary election in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, winning 45 seats, the election commission said on Sunday, positioning it to lead the next regional government.
A year after a failed bid for independence, Iraq's Kurds voted last month in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region.
Announcement of the results was delayed for three weeks after the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission said it received and was investigating 1,045 complaints of electoral violations.
The KDP's historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was in second place with 21 seats, the commission said in a news conference.
With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power, but the results suggest that Masoud Barzani's KDP will take a dominant position in Kurdish politics.
On Sept. 30, election day, the PUK said it might not recognize the results of the election due to what it described as electoral violations but then appeared to backtrack, injecting uncertainty into the process. Election observers also said there were irregularities.
The two parties, who fought a civil war in the 1990s but more recently have taken to sharing power, have recently come out of a grueling political battle in Baghdad, where they competed for the presidency of federal Iraq. The PUK came out on top with the election of Barham Salih.
The largest Kurdish opposition party, Gorran, or Movement for Change, was a distant third with 12 seats.
There are 111 seats in the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament with 11 reserved for minority groups.

The fate of Khan al-Ahmar has drawn international concern after Israel said it planned to raze the village, a ramshackle camp housing 180 residents.
Its residents, backed by foreign activists who have gathered at the site, have been waiting for bulldozers to move in at any time after an Oct. 1 deadline from Israel for the villagers to demolish their own homes expired.
""We will stay alert and be ready to face the raid until news (of the delay) is confirmed,"" said Walid Assaf, a Palestinian Authority minister who is in charge of the settlements file. 
The expulsion plan had included relocation to an area about 12 km (seven miles) away next to a landfill. 
But an official in Netanyahu's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an alternative relocation plan was being looked at, in coordination with the Palestinian Authority.
""The goal is to fully exhaust negotiations and (examine) proposed plans submitted by various agents, including (those received) in the past few days,"" the official said.
On Oct. 17 the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, said in a statement that eviction and demolition of the Khan al-Ahmar could constitute a war crime and the United Nations, European Union and rights groups have urged Israel not to raze the village, citing the impact on its community and prospects for peace.
Israel, which has long sought to clear the Arab nomads from tracts of land between the settlements of Maale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, said Khan al-Ahmar was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain.
The Palestinians say razing the village's tents and tin shacks is part of an Israeli plan to create an arc of Jewish settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, areas captured by Israel in a 1967 war.

Most countries consider settlements built by Israel on land it captured in 1967 as illegal and say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state. Israel disputes this.

EL ALAMEIN, Egypt (Reuters) - For Bill Blackburn, the memories that returned were the flies, the thirst, and the power of the artillery barrage that opened the battle of El Alamein. 
Blackburn was one of six British World War Two veterans to visit the desert battlefield on the 76th anniversary of the decisive Allied victory that marked an important step toward the eventual defeat of German and Italian forces in Africa in May 1943. 
Those who fought are now in their late 90s, and may not return again.
The battle began on the night of Oct. 23 1942 when Commonwealth forces from General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army began driving back Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika, which had threatened to sweep across Egypt and into the Middle East.
""It sounded like hell on earth, the night sky was lit up with gun flashes and bangs, and we got a few shells thrown back at us but nothing compared to what we threw at the Germans,"" said Blackburn, 98, from West Yorkshire, England. 
""After the barrage ceased we were dug in and we were there for several days before the breakthrough, and then we moved forward,"" he added.
The veterans returned to the battle site because the British government paid for the trip for the first time, using the proceeds of fines levied on banks over the manipulation of the Libor interbank interest rate.
Joe Peel, also 98, was a gunner at El Alamein who had his hearing badly damaged by German bombing and said he had never expected to return. 
""It's marvelous to be back here just to see what we did here. But it's changed quite a lot,"" he said, speaking on Saturday at a ceremony at the Commonwealth war cemetery, where the nearby desert and Mediterranean coast is rapidly being developed amid a construction boom.
Across the coastal road is a German war memorial commemorating more than 4,300 German and Austrian dead, where a joint ceremony was held on Saturday for the first time. 
Casualty rates on both sides were especially high at El Alamein. The battle was ""terrible"", Peel said.
""You couldn't see nothing hardly, because the dust and the sand were blowing up with the shells and goodness knows what.""
El Alamein was seen as key for boosting Allied morale, despite more than 13,500 dead, wounded or missing over about 10 days of fighting as Commonwealth forces broke through poorly supplied German lines. 
Blackburn's Royal Artillery regiment eventually advanced through Tunisia before crossing to Italy.

""It was pretty tough really, whenever you had a meal you were eating flies and couldn't get rid of them. It was pretty rough but we got through it,"" Peel said.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Wim Kok, a former Dutch prime minister who helped forge the country's famed consensus-based politics and oversaw pioneering legalizations of euthanasia and gay marriage, died on Saturday of heart failure.
Kok, who was 80, led two centrist coalitions between 1994 and 2002, overseeing a period of recovery and then of strong economic growth.
Kok, a labor union leader earlier in his career, was one architect of the country's famed ""polder"", or consensus model, in which unions agreed to pay restraint in exchange for more jobs, while employers and the government guaranteed support and retraining after layoffs.
As prime minister he reined in spending on healthcare, pensions, education and child benefits, using the savings to promote employment.
In a world first, euthanasia was legalized in the Netherlands in 2002, formalizing decades of practice.
Though Denmark had first legalized gay partnerships in the 1980s, the Netherlands followed in 1998 and became the first to erase any distinction between same-sex and other marriages in 2001.
Kok was friends with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and then-U.S. president Bill Clinton as they crafted the moderate center-left ""Third Way"".
""Shaking off ideological feathers is not a problem only. For a political party like ours, it's also a liberating experience,"" Kok said of steering Labour toward the political center.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte praised Kok as someone who ""stood above political parties.""
Kok was ""totally reliable, totally upright, and always focused on solutions,"" Rutte said in a statement.
Internationally, Kok was strongly pro-European, helping to seal European economic and monetary union at the Amsterdam summit in 1997.
BOSNIAN WAR
His political career ended in two dramas. Shortly before pivotal 2002 elections, his entire cabinet resigned over the role the Dutch military played as U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia.
A study by the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies found Kok's first cabinet blundered badly by sending Dutch troops to defend Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared safe zone, during the Bosnia War.
Outmanned and outgunned, the Dutch battalion did not fight to defend the enclave when battle-hardened Bosnian Serb forces stormed it in 1995. The Dutch looked on helplessly and even helped separate women from men and boys as the Bosnian Serbs prepared to slaughter 8,000 Muslim civilians in the worst mass murder in Europe since World War Two.
Kok said in a recent interview the failure would haunt him forever. ""That book will never be closed,"" he said. ""For many people and for some that goes more intensely than for me. But it also weighs on me.""
After Kok's resignation in April 2002, as his caretaker government prepared for elections, the Netherlands suffered its first political assassination of the post-World War Two era. 
Pim Fortuyn, the first of a new generation of Dutch populists, had declared the Kok years a ""disaster"" due to the country's liberal immigration policies. Fortuyn was gunned down by an animal rights activist.
That ushered in an era of political instability and a debate on immigrants, integration, and Islam that dominated Dutch politics for the following decade, and continues to the present day.
After leaving office, Kok served on the boards of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and ING, among others, and lobbied unsuccessfully for a European Constitution.

He is survived by his wife, Rita, and three children.

LONDON/BELFAST (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of supporters of the European Union marched through London on Saturday in the biggest demonstration so far to demand that the British government holds a public vote on the terms of Brexit.
The protesters waved the blue and gold flag of the EU and held up ""Bollocks to Brexit"" banners under sunny skies to call for another referendum on the eventual deal on how Britain will leave the world's biggest trading bloc.
The march comes after another tumultuous week for Prime Minister Theresa May in which she failed to agree a divorce deal with EU leaders in Brussels and infuriated members of her own party by making further concessions in the talks.
With just over five months until Britain is due to leave there is no clarity about what a future trade deal with the EU will look like and some rebels in May's Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.
James McGrory, one of the organizers of the march, said voters should have the chance to change their minds because the decision will impact their lives for generations. 
""People think the Brexit negotiations are a total mess, they have no faith in the government to deliver the promises that were made, partly because they cannot be delivered,"" he said. 
At the march, demonstrators carried placards saying ""Brexit is pants"", ""Time for an EU turn"" and ""European and proud."" 
Organizers said about 700,000 people took part in the march, which would make it the largest in Britain since a demonstration against the Iraq war in 2003. 
The ""People's Vote"" campaign, which includes several pro-EU groups, said they had stewards stationed at regular intervals to estimate the size of the crowd. The police did not provide an independent estimate of numbers participating. 
Protesters originally gathered near Hyde Park and then walked past Downing Street and finished outside parliament where they listened to politicians from all main political parties.
BREXIT REVERSED?
Britain's 2016 referendum saw 52 percent vote in favor of leaving the European Union. But the past two years have been politically fraught as the government has struggled to agree on a plan and there are fears that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal.
Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favor of remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes and many in Britain say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit.
The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum. The opposition Labour party's Brexit spokesman said last month his party open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc in certain circumstances.
In Belfast in Northern Ireland, around 2,000 people gathered on Saturday to oppose Brexit.
Brendan Heading, a 39-year-old IT worker, said he was worried the decision to leave the EU would damage the economy and could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom. 
""I feel that Brexit threatens prosperity and stability,"" he said. ""People should have the opportunity to vote for an alternative based on what we now know.""
Brexit supporters held their own rally in the town of Harrogate in the north of England. 
Richard Tice, Vice-Chairman of Leave Means Leave and one of the speakers at the event, described the people on the march in London as ""losers"" and said a second referendum would trigger a constitutional crisis.
""We had a vote, we voted to leave, the idea to have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging,"" he said.
""People need to be under no illusions as to how people feel about what is a significant potential for a total betrayal of democracy in this country.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's popular messaging service WhatsApp has become a political battleground in Brazil's most polarized election in decades, raising concerns that it is distorting debate beyond the public eye.
Facebook has touted efforts to crack down on misinformation on its main platform ahead of the Oct. 28 presidential run-off between right-winger Jair Bolsonaro and leftist Fernando Haddad. But WhatsApp has been flooded with falsehoods and conspiracy theories.
Haddad now alleges that businessmen supporting Bolsonaro have been paying to bombard voters with misleading propaganda in violation of electoral law, which his rival denies.
HOW INFLUENTIAL IS WHATSAPP?
WhatsApp has more than 120 million users in Brazil, a country of nearly 210 million, rivaling the reach of Facebook's main platform in one of the company's biggest global markets.
The messaging service has become one of the main ways Brazilians keep in touch with friends, colleagues and family.
The election's first-round vote on Oct. 7 underscored the major role that social media now plays in Brazilian politics.
Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman from a tiny party, had little access to public campaign funding or TV advertising but his grassroots campaign and outsized presence on social media helped him win 46 percent of votes, nearly foregoing a run-off.
Polling firm Datafolha found that two-thirds of Brazilian voters use WhatsApp. Bolsonaro supporters were more likely to follow political news on the platform with 61 percent saying they did so, compared to 38 percent of Haddad voters.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange texts, photos and video beyond the purview of electoral authorities, independent fact checkers or even the platform itself.
False rumors, manipulated photos, decontextualized videos and audio hoaxes have become campaign ammunition, going viral on the platform with no way to monitor their origin or full reach.
Many of the fakes portray Haddad as a communist whose Workers Party would turn Brazil into another Cuba, convert children to homosexuality and plans to rig voting machines.
Others have spread a conspiracy theory that Bolsonaro had staged his near-fatal stabbing at a rally last month, which took him off the campaign trail and out of presidential debates. 
WhatsApp has tried to discourage the tsunami of falsehoods by limiting how many recipients a message can be forwarded to. The company also has run public advertising on how to spot fake news and blocked hundreds of thousands of accounts during the campaign, with technology spotting automated ""bot"" behavior.
WHAT IS THE LATEST SCANDAL?
Haddad accuses Bolsonaro of not just benefiting from misinformation on WhatsApp but encouraging supporters to fund bulk messaging over the platform. That would amount to soliciting illegal campaign contributions in what they call an ""abuse of economic power"" undermining the election.
On Thursday, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported Bolsonaro supporters had paid digital marketing firms up to 12 million reais ($3.26 million) each to spread tens of thousands of attack ads. Haddad said his party had witnesses who heard Bolsonaro encouraging business leaders to fund the efforts.
Bolsonaro has denied any knowledge of such a scheme and called on any supporters doing so to stop.
WhatsApp said it takes the allegations seriously and is ""taking immediate legal action to stop companies from sending bulk messages,"" including cease-and-desist letters to the companies in question. 
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES?
Brazil's chief electoral court on Friday opened an investigation into the allegations, which pundits quickly labeled ""WhatsAppgate.""
Haddad's allies argue that the scandal should invalidate the election. However, the investigation is unlikely to derail Bolsonaro's campaign with just a week to go before the vote and an 18 percentage point lead over Haddad in recent opinion polls.
Still, the allegations have tensed up an already angry and polarized electorate and are likely to hang over the next government.
The way marketing companies obtained cellphone numbers used for WhatsApp messaging may have violated Brazil's data privacy laws, according to Fabio Malini, a professor of technology at Espirito Santo federal university.

Brazilian lawmakers and judges have tried repeatedly in recent years to encroach on the privacy offered by WhatsApp, creating headaches for Facebook executives who are often called to account. The latest electoral scandal could intensify those pressures.

Forty attacks have been carried out since October 2017 in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province, an area near the Tanzanian border close to where companies are developing one of the biggest natural gas finds in a decade. More than 100 people have been killed, often by decapitation.
In a press conference on Friday, Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro said security forces had launched operations over the last few months against ""criminals"" in eastern and southern areas, but that some of them had managed to flee.
""During that operation, some criminals were arrested and some ... died, and a few escaped. Those who escaped are the ones trying to cross the border to Mozambique to establish a base,"" he told a news conference.
""After questioning them, they said they were going there to join radical camps,"" Sirro added.
Earlier this month, Mozambique put 189 people, including foreigners, on trial on accusations of involvement in Islamist attacks in Cabo Delgado. [L8N1WJ557]
The province is near one of the world's biggest untapped offshore natural gas fields, and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) is seeking to raise $14 billion-$15 billion for a liquefied natural gas project in the region.
In June, President Filipe Nyusi vowed to be relentless and firm in detaining those responsible for the attacks.
Mozambique has no history of Islamist militancy and authorities have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. About 30 percent of Mozambique's 30 million people are Roman Catholics, while 18 percent are Muslim.

(Reuters) - A Florida city commissioner has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder for shooting a man he suspected of trying to shoplift a hatchet from his military surplus store, officials said on Saturday.
Michael Dunn, a commissioner in the city of Lakeland between Tampa and Orlando, was acting in self-defense, his attorney told local media. Florida's ""stand your ground"" law removes the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allows the use of deadly force when a person feels greatly threatened.
But prosecutors rejected that explanation for the Oct. 3 shooting and Dunn was arrested at his lawyer's office late on Friday, Lakeland police spokesman Gary Gross said in an email.
Brian Haas, state attorney for the 10th district of Florida, told a news conference that on Friday a grand jury indicted Dunn on a charge of second-degree murder.
Second-degree murder is less serious than first-degree murder because it does not involve an allegation of pre-meditation. In Florida, a person convicted of the crime still faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison.
Haas told reporters that he found Dunn's actions were not justified under Florida's ""stand your ground"" legislation. 
An attorney for Dunn could not be reached for comment on Saturday.
The victim, 50-year-old Cristobal Lopez, had entered the store with his father. Dunn saw Lopez conceal a hatchet and asked him if he planned to pay for it, police said in a statement the day after the shooting.

In security camera footage from the store that was made public, Lopez is seen trying to leave with the hatchet while Dunn attempts to pull him back by his shirt with one hand and points a pistol at him with the other. Dunn then shoots Lopez, who falls to the ground.

TECUN UMAN, Guatemala (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central Americans in a U.S.-bound migrant caravan were stuck on Guatemala's border with Mexico on Saturday as efforts began, under pressure from Washington, to send some home and stop their journey northward.
Many of the migrants, the overwhelming majority fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras, had slept through heavy rain overnight on a bridge connecting Guatemala to Mexico, as dozens crammed against a metal border gate guarded by Mexican police.
In the early morning hours, Guatemalan police said they had transported 62 Hondurans in two buses, among the first such efforts to remove migrants from the tense border crossing on the Suchiate River. 
For days U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the Central American caravan must be stopped. He has made it a political issue in the Nov. 6 midterm U.S. congressional election, threatened to cut off regional aid, close the U.S.-Mexico border and deploy troops there if Mexico failed to halt the migrants.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was due to meet his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales in the Guatemalan capital on Saturday for talks on implementing a strategy for returning the Honduran migrants.
Organizers said the caravan included around 4,000 migrants on Friday but there has been no official estimate of the sprawling number of men, women and children traveling north on foot and in vehicles.
""The (U.S.) tone is one of worry and they told us that we should act like allies,"" a senior aide to Guatemala's president told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly.
""It's really a very delicate situation because this could generate more caravans,"" he said. 
On Friday, hundreds of migrants at the head of the caravan had poured through Guatemalan border posts and onto the bridge, but were repelled by dozens of shield-bearing Mexican police. Several complained they had been teargassed.
Drained from days of walking and frustrated, many spent the night in the open. Some stretched towels and garbage bags along the bridge walls, others lay down on backpacks, while a man applied lotion to his tired feet.
Mexico's government, which says it will process migrants' claims for asylum individually, vowed to tackle the caravan as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met top officials in Mexico City. Pompeo urged Mexico to ensure the procession did not reach the United States.
Most of the migrants Reuters spoke to said their ultimate destination was the United States. Some said they hoped to stay in Mexico, but they had no idea how to get the documentation needed to do so. 
Still, many were determined to try.
""No, I'll fight. I'll try again,"" said Honduran Hilda Rosa as her four teenage children sat upright, beaming as she pumped the air with her fist.
The native of Tegucigalpa told a familiar tale when asked why she had left Honduras: ""You know why: no work, violence.""
SOME TURNING BACK
Most of the people now caught trying to enter the United States illegally hail from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, among the poorest and most violent countries in the Americas.
The caravan members ranged from farmers and bakers to housewives and students, and included a whole block of friends and family from the Honduran city of El Progreso, some of whom said they would start going back to where they came from on Saturday.
Jose Ramon Rodriguez, 45, a construction worker from El Progreso, sat on the Guatemalan end of the bridge late on Friday with his head hanging low, his 9-year-old son tucked against him.
""Tomorrow we go home,"" he said. His companions nodded.
Among them was Osman Melgar, who nursed a bleeding gash on his shin, suffered when he fell as dozens of people packed on the bridge began fleeing when police, according to several eyewitnesses, used tear gas.
Some, including 40-year-old Adriana Consuelo, went under the bridge, paying raftsmen 25 pesos ($1.30) to ferry them across the river on vessels made of giant rubber tires.
After making it to the muddy banks of Mexico, she said, ""No one checked my documents,"" as Consuelo headed to a taco restaurant.
But Mexico had stepped up its efforts to stop the flow of people, migration experts said.
""Every time there's a (migrant) caravan there are police sent to the southern border ... but we've never seen anything as dramatic as we're seeing today,"" said Eunice Rendon, coordinator of migrant advocacy group Agenda Migrante.

""This has everything to do with Trump,"" she added.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Saturday welcomed the approval by Macedonia's parliament of a proposed change to the country's name as a decisive step toward ending decades of discord between the two neighbours.
Macedonia's parliament approved the proposed new name of Republic of North Macedonia on Friday after a referendum last month failed to reach the minimum participation threshold.
The move could unblock Macedonia's bids to join NATO and the European Union, long blocked by Greece, which argues that ""Macedonia"" implied territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.
The proposal still has to jump through further hoops of approval, including passage in Greece's parliament despite the hostility of the Greek defense minister to be formally adopted.
""Today is a symbolic and historic day for our foreign policy after yesterday's decision at the Skopje's parliament which opens the way for the implementation of an historic accord,"" Tsipras said at a ceremony to take charge of the foreign affairs portfolio.
He said implementation of the accord would also allow the small Balkan state to join international organizations, referring to the European Union and NATO.
Tsipras has taken on the foreign minister role after Nikos Kotzias, Greece's main negotiator in talks that led to the deal, stepped down following a row with Defence Minister Panos Kammenos at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Kammenos is head of the co-ruling right-wing Independent Greeks party, which with Tsipras' leftist Syriza party has a slim majority in Greece's parliament. 
He has called the Macedonia deal a national sell-out and has threatened to resign if it comes before the Greek parliament.
In a long dispute with its neighbor, Greece has insisted on the name change because it views the name Macedonia as implying a territorial claim on a northern Greek region of the same name and an attempt to hijack ancient Greek civilization.
In announcing Kotzias' resignation on Wednesday, Tsipras said he would no longer tolerate ""double speak"" among members of his cabinet, in a barb thought to be directed toward Kammenos.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Kammenos implied backhanders played a role in the Macedonian approval of the name change. 
""Who would have thought that in Europe of values and democracy those who do not vote according to instructions are jailed, and those who comply get a 2 million euro bonus in black money,"" he tweeted after the Macedonian parliament's vote.
Macedonian government spokesman Mile Bosnjakovski tweeted in response that Kammenos' comment was ""fake news"" which the country's government had already denied.

There has been no reaction from Tsipras.

Pachauri denies the charges and has sought a speedy trial due to his old age, his counsel Ashish Dikshit told Reuters. 
Pachauri is accused of making physical advances, wrongful restraint, sending unwanted emails, and messages.
He goes on trial just as the #MeToo movement sweeps India with a large number of women accusing public figures in the media and entertainment industry of sexual misconduct. A junior government minister resigned last week after women accused him of making physical advances in hotel rooms and in the office during his previous career as a journalist.
India is also considering tightening sexual harassment laws, government officials told Reuters last week.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 06:08AM ET</span>",Indian officials exchange blame for train plowing into festival crowd,"By Sudarshan Varadhan
AMRITSAR, India (Reuters) - India's railway officials and local community leaders traded blame on Saturday over an accident in which a train ran over scores of people gathered on the railway tracks for a festival in the northern city of Amritsar.
Punjab state's Chief Minister Amarinder Singh told reporters on Saturday that 59 people had died with 57 injured in the accident and that an official inquiry would be carried out over the next four weeks.
A large crowd had formed near the tracks on the city's fringe for the burning of effigies as part of a major Hindu festival on Friday when the train sped through the gathering in darkness, officials and witnesses said.
Grieving relatives and residents, some of whom were still scouring the bloodied fields for belongings of their loved ones, said there was no warning from the train as it rolled down the tracks just as firecrackers exploded in the sky in the annual Dusshera festival.
""I've been seeing this event every Dusshera from here and this has never happened before, the railways should have stopped or slowed down the train,"" said Deep Kumari, who watched the festival from the terrace of her house. ""Everyone here knows this effigy burning happens here and there is a big crowd.""
India's state railways, largely built during British colonial rule, have long faced criticism for their safety record. A political focus on keeping fares low for the 23 million passengers who use the network daily has resulted in decades of underinvestment in rail safety infrastructure, critics say.
Data from parliament in July showed that 49,790 people were killed by trains on the tracks in India between 2015 to 2017.
Friday's accident was the worst in years but Manoj Sinha, the junior minister in charge of running the world's fourth largest rail system, said they couldn't be held responsible for people gathered on tracks.
""Railways cannot be blamed, railways were not informed about the ceremony. Why was it organized there? There was no notice given to the railways,"" he told reporters as he visited the site early on Saturday, surrounded by officials and police.
Clothes were strewn and there were blood marks around the narrow railway lane on the outskirts of Amritsar where the accident occurred. Police said they were still looking to ascertain the number of dead as some bodies were mangled beyond recognition.
Video footage running on television stations and social media showed giant effigies burning in the distance and crackers going off while the train runs through in the foreground. Many of the victims were shooting videos on their mobile phones or taking selfies.
Witnesses also said that Friday's ceremony was delayed by a few hours because the chief guest was running late, which meant the event ultimately coincided with the train's scheduled arrival. 
Anger turned on Navjyot Kaur Sidhu, a former Punjab state lawmaker who came late for the burning of the effigies and then left just before the accident occurred.
Bikram Singh Majitha, a leader of the regional Akali Dal party, said the effigy burning usually happens at sunset, not later. 
""You can see from some of the videos that people shot that as soon as the effigy was lit, you can the train coming from the other side. It was horrific, the organizers must answer why the delay,"" he said.
But Kaur, whose husband, Navjyot Singh Sidhu, is a former Indian Test cricketer and now a state minister, said effigies were burned at six places in Amritsar and most of them were in fields near the tracks.

""The (railway authorities) should have at least issued directions to slow down the speed of the train. Such a big mistake,"" Kaur said on television.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Trump a reluctant critic of Saudi Arabia despite pressure to act,"By Steve Holland and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six days after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared, U.S. President Donald Trump tried to play down the crisis, saying ""hopefully that will sort itself out"".
It did not, and on Oct. 10, amid a growing outcry, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton pressed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, in what one U.S. official described as a ""stern"" phone call, to identify who was responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance or death.
Trump then seemed to give Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt, suggesting ""rogue killers"" may have been to blame and criticizing a growing view that this was a case of state murder.
He changed his tone once again late this week, raising the prospect of sanctions against Riyadh. 
But when Saudi Arabia finally admitted on Saturday that Khashoggi was dead, saying he was killed in a fight inside the consulate, Trump said the official explanation was ""credible"" even as Republican and Democratic lawmakers responded with anger and disbelief.
Over the last two weeks, Trump has at times spoken of punishing Saudi Arabia but appeared reluctant to follow through against a close economic and security ally in the Middle East, a key player in ensuring the stability of global oil markets, and a major customer of arms deals that he says are ""tremendous"".
""Trump's dug himself into a hole,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East adviser to both Democratic and Republican administrations. ""He will have to take some kind of action.""
Behind the scenes, though, Trump's aides scrambled to craft a response, especially as the bipartisan outcry in the Washington establishment grew.
When news of Khashoggi's disappearance first broke, aides made clear to White House chief of staff John Kelly that the case was not going away, two senior White House officials said.
Kushner, who had cultivated a close personal relationship with the crown prince, commonly known as MbS, urged Trump to act with caution to avoid upsetting a critical strategic and economic relationship, a senior administration official said.
Kushner was heavily involved in making Saudi Arabia Trump's first stop on his maiden international trip as president last year.
As grim allegations emerged from Turkey about Khashoggi’s death and the Saudis stuck to their denials, Trump felt pressure from congressional Democrats and some of his own Republicans.
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican close to Trump, accused MbS of ordering Khashoggi's murder and called him a ""wrecking ball"" jeopardizing relations with the United States.
When Riyadh came out with its official version of what happened inside the consulate, Graham quickly tweeted he was ""skeptical of the new Saudi narrative"".
'NOT A U.S. CITIZEN'
Trump sought to justify his muted response by pointing out the incident occurred in Turkey and that Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for the Washington Post, was ""not a United States citizen"".
Critics accused Trump of trying to give the Saudis diplomatic cover and buy time for them to get their story straight, something Trump's aides denied.
At the same time, Peter Navarro, Trump’s White House trade chief and architect of his “Buy American” policy to ease restrictions on foreign arms sales, was stressing the importance of Saudi weapons deals and the implications for U.S. jobs, another administration official told Reuters.
Trump repeatedly touted the $110 billion in weapons deals he announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia last year, and insisted around 500,000 U.S. jobs were at stake. Experts have dismissed the sales and jobs numbers as highly exaggerated.
Some Trump aides raised doubts about the veracity of the Turkish government’s leaks of what it says happened to Khashoggi. 
But as the days dragged on and evidence of Khashoggi’s death mounted, Trump's view began to shift, White House officials said.
He ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to drop what he was doing and fly to Riyadh for talks at mid-week, and was then briefed by him at the White House on Thursday.
Critics slammed Pompeo for appearing to hold court in a festive manner with MbS, undercutting the severity of the U.S. message.
But one senior White House official countered, saying Pompeo told the Saudi royals that “you need to give us some legitimate information soon, people aren’t just going to let it drag on.'”
Speaking to reporters during a trip to Arizona on Friday, Trump said he was ready to “listen to what Congress has to say” about actions to be taken in the Khashoggi case, yet also made clear he wanted to continue to protect defense contracts, and U.S. jobs dependent on them.
Congress has already triggered a mechanism for the U.S. Treasury Department to consider human rights sanctions against Saudi Arabia and some lawmakers have vowed to block further arms sales to Riyadh, a move that Trump is likely to oppose.

German prosecutors have said businessman Trinh Xuan Thanh, who had sought asylum in Germany, was abducted in a Berlin street by Vietnamese secret service agents and taken back to Vietnam, where he was tried and jailed for life.
The alleged incident took place during a visit to Slovakia by Vietnamese public security minister To Lam in July 2017.
Slovakia's foreign minister met with his Vietnamese counterpart on the sidelines of a UN general assembly meeting last month seeking an explanation but the country has yet to hear back from Hanoi, the ministry said.
“We haven’t yet received a reply from Vietnam,"" the ministry said in a statement. Minister Miroslav Lajcak said that unless Hanoi provided a credible explanation of how the kidnapped (Vietnamese) citizen got to Vietnam, bilateral relations between the countries would be frozen.
""Slovakia is a serious state and will draw resolute diplomatic consequences if the suspicions that Vietnam is facing prove to be true.”
The case has also soured relations between Germany and Vietnam and prompted Germany to accuse Vietnam of breaching international law. A German court in July sentenced a Vietnamese man to three years and 10 months in jail after he confessed to helping his country's secret services kidnap Thanh. 
Slovakia sought to distance itself from the incident following a report in Dennik N alleging Thanh was taken in a van from Berlin via Prague to Bratislava, where he was added to the Vietnamese minister's delegation and left on a Slovak government plane.

Former interior minister Robert Kalinak in August denied any involvement in the kidnapping, calling the media report ""science-fiction"".

Islamic State militants staged multiple suicide attacks in Sweida and overran nearby villages in southwestern Syria on July 25, killing more than 200 people, many of them civilians. 
Sweida, which is under state rule, has a mainly Druze community. Druze authorities and Islamic State have held negotiations for the release of the hostages.
Syrian state news agency SANA said two women and four children returned home on Saturday after being kidnapped from a village east of Sweida city. 
""As a result of the army's siege on the terrorists, and efforts by the concerned entities, six of the 29 hostages were freed, and the rest will be freed very soon,"" SANA cited Sweida Governor Amer al-Eshi as saying. 
Islamic State fighters were holding at least 16 children among its captives in the Sweida desert and had beheaded one hostage, Human Rights Watch said in August. 
Syrian government forces, backed by Russia and Iran, have been battling the militants in a small Islamic State enclave northeast of Sweida city.

The voluntary, non-binding guidelines build on an existing code to manage sea encounters adopted by all 18 countries last year, which was designed to mitigate risks following a boom in the region's maritime and air traffic in recent years.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2018 01:24AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. weighs new warship passage through Taiwan Strait,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
SINGAPORE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering a new operation to send warships through the Taiwan Strait, U.S. officials tell Reuters, a mission aimed at ensuring free passage through the strategic waterway but which risks heightening tensions with China.
The U.S. Navy conducted a similar mission in the strait's international waters in July and any repeat would be seen in self-ruled Taiwan as a fresh expression of support by President Donald Trump's government.
The U.S. military declined comment and U.S. officials who discussed the deliberations, which have not been previously reported, did so on condition of anonymity. They did not discuss the potential timing for any fresh passage through the strait.
China views Taiwan as a wayward province and has been ramping up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island. It raised concerns over U.S. policy toward Taiwan in talks this week with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Singapore. 
Even as Washington mulls ordering a fresh passage through the strait, it has been trying to explain to Beijing that its policies toward Taiwan are unchanged. 
Mattis delivered that message to China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe personally on Thursday, on the sidelines of an Asian security forum.
""Minister Wei raised Taiwan and concerns about our policy. The Secretary reassured Minister Wei that we haven't changed our Taiwan policy, our one China policy,"" said Randall Schriver, a U.S. assistant secretary of defense who helps guide Pentagon policy in Asia. 
""So it was, I think, a familiar exchange."" 
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island's main source of arms. The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taiwan more than $15 billion in weaponry since 2010.
U.S.-CHINA FLASHPOINTS
Taiwan is only one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which also include a bitter trade war, U.S. sanctions and China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.
Mattis told Wei on Thursday that the world's two largest economies needed to deepen high-level military ties so as to navigate tension and rein in the risk of inadvertent conflict. 
Some current and former U.S. officials say U.S. warship passages in the Taiwan Strait are still too infrequent, and note that a U.S. aircraft carrier hasn't transited the Taiwan Strait since 2007, during the administration of George W. Bush. 
When the last two U.S. warships, both destroyers, sailed through the Taiwan Strait in July, it was the first such operation in about a year. 
Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, responded to the July passage with a warning to the United States to avoid jeopardizing ""peace and stability"" in the strategic waterway.
It has also viewed U.S. overtures toward Taiwan with alarm, including its unveiling a new de facto embassy in Taiwan and passage of the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages U.S. officials to visit the island.
Military experts say the balance of power between Taiwan and China has shifted decisively in China's favor in recent years, and China could easily overwhelm the island unless U.S. forces came quickly to Taiwan's aid.
China has also alarmed Taiwan by ramping up military exercises this year, including flying bombers and other military aircraft around the island and sending its aircraft carrier through the narrow Taiwan Strait separating it from Taiwan.
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said last week the island will increase its defense budget every year to ensure it can defend its sovereignty, including resuming domestic development of advanced training aircraft and submarines.
""At this time, China's intimidation and diplomatic pressure not only hurts relations between both sides, but seriously challenges the peaceful stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" she said in a National Day speech in Taipei on Oct. 10.
Her remarks came ahead of island-wide local elections in late November that are seen as a bellwether for her ruling party's performance in presidential elections due in 2020.

""This is deeply disturbing,"" Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters on Friday. ""I have never seen anything like this in my 41-1/2 years (on the force), ever.""
Investigators are working to establish ages and identities.
An official with Perry Funeral Home, which offers burial and cremation services, declined to comment on the incident.
The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in a statement it revoked the funeral home's license and shut down the facility after inspectors ""found heinous conditions and negligent conduct at the home."" 
Police have also launched an investigation into the now defunct Cantrell Funeral Home, where the remains of the 11 babies were uncovered last week after authorities received an anonymous letter leading them to the remains.
Its former operators have not commented to media.
In April, state regulators found ""deplorable, unsanitary conditions"" at the same premises, including embalmed bodies in an unrefrigerated garage and other badly decomposed remains, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in a statement at the time. 
The funeral home was also accused of several licensing and financial violations, the agency said.

(Reuters) - A Vietnamese dissident known as ""Mother Mushroom"" went on hunger strike three times during her imprisonment before Hanoi released her, she said on Friday after arriving in the United States.
Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, a 39-year-old blogger and environmental activist who adopted Mother Mushroom as a pen name, said she believed Vietnam timed her release to coincide with the visit this week of U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
Speaking to Reuters by Skype video from Houston, Quynh described her two years in prison, where she said she was isolated from other prisoners to keep her from influencing them, including the previously unreported hunger strikes.
""The shortest was seven days and the longest was 16 days,"" said Quynh, speaking at times through an interpreter and at times in broken English.
A representative for the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite economic reform, openness to social change and closer ties to former foe the United States, Vietnam's Communist Party rulers retain tight media control and do not tolerate criticism.
Quynh said she witnessed other female inmates forced to take showers outdoors in harsh weather and share a cell with up to 50 others.
""Female prisoners have absolutely no privacy,"" said Quynh, who was among 13 women to receive an International Women of Courage Award last year.
Quynh was arrested in 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in jail last year for posting reports, including one about civilians dying in police custody that police deemed to be anti-state. She was released for humanitarian reasons, and her jail term suspended, Vietnam's foreign ministry said.
The United States sees Vietnam as an important partner in the face of China's rapid rise, but Washington has criticized Hanoi over human rights. 
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said that aside from having called for the release of Quynh, Washington has also advocated for others imprisoned in Vietnam for ""exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms.""
Quynh said she initially felt sad about the prospect of living in exile after a U.S. embassy official visited her in prison on July 24 and said she would be released to live in the United States. 
""If I have the right to choose, I want to stay in Vietnam, but I have two children so I have to think about the future."" 
She left with her 12-year-old daughter, 6-year-old son and 63-year-old mother. 
Quynh does not believe her release, or the release in June of Vietnamese human rights lawyer Nguyen Van Dai, signaled any change in Vietnam's policy on political prisoners.
Human Rights Watch said Vietnam had adopted a strategy of political repression under which it arrests activists on ""bogus"" charges, jails them for long terms and then offers a ""freedom for exile deal"" and claims credit for the release.

Two Vietnamese-Americans were sentenced to 14 years in prison last month for ""attempting to overthrow the state"" and 10 other ""accomplices"" were sentenced to shorter jail terms, a court official said.

Mohammed Dewji, 43-year-old CEO of the METL Group family conglomerate, was seized as he arrived for a morning workout in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam last week. Forbes estimates his net worth as $1.5 billion, making him Africa's 17th richest man and its youngest billionaire.
""I have returned home safely'"" METL Group quoted him as saying on its Twitter feed, without providing more details about how he was freed or got away from his captors.
The company also quoted him thanking those who had worked for his release, including the police.
The seizure of Dewji, who has also served as member of parliament in the past, had caused consternation in the East African nation as he is one of its most prominent business executives. 
January Makamba, the country's minister of environment and Dewji's former colleague in parliament, also tweeted on Saturday morning that he had spoken with him and that he was safe.
Makamba said that Dewji had bruises on his hands and feet from being tied up by his kidnappers. He said the kidnappers had freed Dewji by dumping him in a field in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Dewji's family had offered a reward of 1 billion Tanzania shillings ($440,000) for information leading to his release.
METL Group is involved in a diverse range of manufacturing, farming, transport, infrastructure, agroprocessing and telecoms businesses spanning 11 African countries.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, brought the gift of dignity to Australia's war veterans on Saturday, laying a wreath for those who died at an Anzac war memorial.
The Prince, in military uniform, and his wife, respectfully clothed in a high-necked black dress by New Zealand designer Emilia Wickstead, silently and gently placed the wreath to rest together before fighter jets thundered past.
The memorial, in Sydney's Hyde Park, was first opened in 1934 by Harry's great, great uncle and namesake, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.
Retired General David Hurley, Governor of New South Wales, said there had been a crowd 100,000-strong at that opening where the Duke unveiled a plaque that said in simple terms: ""Opened, by the son of a King"".
To echo those sentiments, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, unveiled the commemorative plaque at the re-opening following a $40 million upgrade that completes the original 1930s design by architect Bruce Dellitt.
In his speech at the opening, General Hurley told the crowd that a public fund had been established on the first anniversary of the Gallipoli landing to build the memorial but after the Great Depression hit, it was never completed. 
The memorial has now been finished in time for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One after a $40 million upgrade to include a spectacular cascading waterfall, a hall of service, education facilities and a library.
""Let silent contemplation be your offering,"" said General Hurley.
""These words found at the entrance to the hall of silence evoke the sense of loss and grief that this memorial represents to the people of NSW."" 
The hall contains an artwork collection of 1701 soil samples from every town, city or district that were homes of those who fought in World War One.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex toured the upgraded memorial before attending the opening ceremony alongside Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other dignitaries. 
Later on Saturday they are due to attend the first day of the Invictus Games on Sydney's Cockatoo Island.

The royal couple have also toured the drought-stricken NSW town of Dubbo and participated in a group hug on Sydney's Bondi Beach.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Melissa Madara was not surprised to receive death threats on Friday as her Brooklyn witchcraft store prepared to host a public hexing of newly confirmed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh this weekend.
The planned casting of an anti-Kavanaugh spell, one of the more striking instances of politically disgruntled Americans turning to the supernatural when frustrated by democracy, has drawn backlash from some Christian groups but support from like-minded witch covens.
""It gives the people who are seeking agency a little bit of chance to have that back,"" Madara said. The ritual was scheduled to be livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram at 8 p.m. EDT on Saturday (1200 GMT Sunday). 
Seated at a desk phone among bird skulls and crystal balls at Catland Books, the occult shop she co-owns, Madara said the Kavanaugh hex is expected to be the most popular event the store has hosted since its 2013 opening, including spells aimed at President Donald Trump. Madara declined to provide details of what the latest ritual will entail. 
More than 15,000 people who have seen Catland Books promotions on Facebook have expressed interest in attending the event, vastly exceeding the shop's 60-person capacity.
Not everyone is a witchcraft fan. Madara said she had fielded numerous irate calls from critics, with at least one threatening violence. “Every time we host something like this there’s always people who like to call in with death threats or read us scripture,"" she said.
As far as supporters go, some are sexual assault survivors still angry that the U.S. Senate confirmed Kavanaugh's lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court despite accusations that he had sexually assaulted multiple women.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, and an FBI investigation failed to corroborate his accusers' accounts.
Democrats hope lingering outrage over Kavanaugh, particularly among women, will translate into election gains for them on Nov. 6. Republicans are likewise trying to seize on anger among conservatives at how they perceive Kavanaugh was mistreated.
Believers in mysticism on both sides of the political divide are taking matters into their own hands.
Plans for the Catland Books event have sparked ""counter hexes"" around the country by those seeking to undo the spell that the Brooklyn witches cast against Kavanaugh, Madara said.
Even mainstream clergy was joining the fray. Rev. Gary Thomas of the Diocese of San Jose in California said on Friday that he would include Kavanaugh in his prayers at Saturday mass. 
""I think this is much more serious than people give it credit for,"" Thomas said. ""Conjuring a hex can be very dangerous.""
Politically oriented witchcraft has seen a renewed surge in popularity since Trump took office. 
Magician Michael Hughes drew crowds of supporters and more than 12,000 ""likes"" to his Facebook page when he held a “mass spell"" to curse Trump in February 2017. 

""We are embracing witchcraft's true roots as the magik of the poor, the downtrodden and disenfranchised,"" Catland Books said in Facebook post for its event.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 09:16PM ET</span>",Bolton readies Moscow visit amid U.S. concerns about missile treaty,"By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, will visit Moscow next week for talks that may include telling Russian officials that the United States plans to withdraw from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
While Bolton will discuss other major topics with Russian officials, including North Korea, Ukraine and Syria, the 1987 accord between the United States and the former Soviet Union is also expected to come up.
The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1988, required elimination of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries.
The United States believes Russia is in violation of the accord. The New York Times said Bolton would tell Moscow that Washington planned to withdraw from the treaty. White House officials did not deny the report.
A senior Trump administration official said two administrations had tried to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty.
""Despite our objections, Russia continues to produce and field prohibited cruise missiles and has ignored calls for transparency,"" the official said. 
Withdrawing from the INF treaty could have major implications for U.S. defense policy in Asia and toward its main strategic rival there, China, with which Trump is engaged in a trade war. 
China is not a party to the treaty and has invested heavily in conventional missiles as part of an anti-access/area denial strategy, while the INF has banned U.S possession of ground- launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles of ranges between 500 and 5,500 km (311 and 3,418 miles).
IMPLICATIONS FOR ASIA 
""It has had major implications for Asia,"" said Eric Sayers, who served as an adviser to former U.S Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris and is now an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
""This will give the Pentagon and Indo-Pacific Command new conventional options to restore the military balance in the theater,"" Sayers said.
Earlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis said Russia’s violation of the INF treaty was ""untenable"" and unless it changed course the United States would respond.
Washington believes Moscow is developing a ground-launched system in breach of the INF treaty that could allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice. Russia has consistently denied any such violation.
The Pentagon’s nuclear policy document released in February said that in response to Russia’s violation, the United States would start reviewing its own options for conventional, ground-launched, intermediate-range missile systems.
The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to meet with Bolton, the RIA news agency reported. Bolton's meetings in Moscow were scheduled for Oct. 22-23, RIA said.
Bolton said on Twitter that he planned to meet with top Russian officials but did not mention Putin.
""Heading to Moscow tomorrow to meet with senior Russian leaders, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, to continue discussions that began in Helsinki between our two countries,"" Bolton said.
Critics of Trump have accused him of being soft on Russia, and both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress are pushing for more sanctions on Moscow. Sanctions had been imposed for Russia's suspected meddling in elections in the United States and other countries, the Ukraine crisis and allegations it was behind a nerve agent attack in Britain. 
The Kremlin has denied any election interference or role in the nerve attack.
A senior administration official said Bolton will use the trip to discuss the next meeting between Trump and Putin. The two leaders may see each other in Paris at a Nov. 11 celebration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One.
But they may have more substantive talks on the fringes of a G-20 summit in Argentina later in November.
Trump's invitation to Putin to visit Washington still stood, the official said. Trump made the invitation in the aftermath of a summit in Helsinki in which he appeared to accept Putin's denials of interference in the 2016 U.S. election over the word of his own intelligence agencies.
While in Moscow, Bolton will emphasize the importance of maintaining sanctions against North Korea in order to keep pressure on the elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. Russia and China have suggested easing sanctions. 

Bolton will also travel to Azerbaijan for discussions on a range of regional issues including Iran, before continuing to Armenia and Georgia.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 07:03PM ET</span>","Black 'lynching' ad illustrates race overtones, anger in U.S. campaign ads","By Maria Caspani
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many political ads in this year's U.S. elections pack an unusually harsh and personal punch - some with racial overtones.
In Arkansas, a radio ad this week suggests white Democrats might start lynching black men. In New York, a congressman's supporters drew attention to his black rival's history as a rapper. In California, Ohio and Virginia, candidates and their supporters cast their opponents as terrorists. In Pennsylvania, a Republican state senator threatened to ""stomp all over"" his Democratic rival's face with golf spikes.
And in Arizona, a lawmaker's six siblings urged voters not to re-elect their Republican brother.
While angry advertisements are a longstanding feature of U.S. politics, many ads this year made little effort to disguise their candidates' rage, a vivid illustration of what many experts see as a coarsening of public dialogue since President Donald Trump shook up American politics.
Heavy spending for a non-presidential election cycle and the speed with which ads are spreading online is magnifying the effect. Political spending on television spots is up 19 percent from 2014, the last U.S. congressional midterm election cycle, to $2.9 billion - levels closer to spending for a presidential election, according to MAGNA, an arm of advertising agency IPG Mediabrands.
""As the amount of money in campaigns increases I think the volume of negative ads is increasing,"" said Nathan Gonzales of Inside Elections, a nonpartisan campaign analysis group.
A radio ad that aired this week in Arkansas in support of Republican U.S. Representative French Hill featured women with exaggerated and stereotyped African-American accents saying black voters should support Hill and Republicans because Democrats will lynch black men when ""a white girl screams rape.""
Hill's campaign did not run the ad and condemned it as ""outrageous."" Hill and his Democratic opponent, Clarke Tucker, are both white.
TIED TO KAVANAUGH HEARING
The ad cites the accusation that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl when he was a 17-year-old high school student. Kavanaugh denied the accusation, which dominated the final days of his Senate confirmation and which prompted Republicans to say Democrats had abandoned the idea of presumption of innocence.
In the ad, a woman says ""white Democrats will be lynching black folk again.""
""We have to protect our men and boys,"" the woman says. ""We can't afford to let white Democrats take us back to bad old days of race verdicts, life sentences and lynchings when a white girl screams rape.""
Bruce Bartlett, a senior policy adviser in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, called it ""the most racist ad by a Republican I have ever come across.""
Vernon Robinson of Black Americans for the President's Agenda, a political action committee, produced the ads. He defended them in a Friday telephone interview and said they will run through the elections.
""I could not believe the lunatic fringe of the Democratic Party was pushing the presumption of guilt on the accused,"" Robinson told Reuters, referring to the Kavanaugh hearings, which did not have a racial aspect. ""This is a serious threat to black men and the women who love them.""
Malik Russell, a spokesman for the NAACP civil rights group, called the ad ""one of the worst examples of racist ignorance and historic misappropriation."" He blamed Trump for setting the tone.
""The racism, hateful and disrespectful rhetoric targeting immigrants, women and communities of color coming from the White House has served as a powerful enabler to those around the nation who support white supremacy,"" Russell said.
The shift in tone comes as Democrats are fighting for majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, which would give them more power to oppose the Republican president's agenda.
Opinion polls generally show Democrats with a strong chance of gaining the 23 House seats they need to take a majority, with a harder battle to pick up the two seats they would need for a Senate majority in the Nov. 6 elections.
That partly explains the preponderance of negative television ads in the Senate races - with half the ads running from Sept. 4 through Oct. 1 taking a negative tone, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. More than the 40.8 percent of House ads and 43.2 percent of governors' ads took a negative tone, according to the study.
NEGATIVE REPUBLICAN ADS
It found that more than a third of Republican TV ads for Senate and House races were negative, which it defined as ads that solely focus on a candidate's rival.
That is sharply higher than the 18.3 percent of Democratic Senate ads and 14.1 percent of Democratic House ads that were negative in tone. It also represented a switch from 2014, when ads by Democrats were substantially more negative than those by Republicans.
Other 2018 election ads came in for criticism for threatening violence or perceived xenophobia.
Scott Wagner, a Republican challenging Democratic incumbent Tom Wolf for governor of Pennsylvania, threatened his rival with the ""golf spikes"" ad. Polls show Wolf has a wide lead.
""Governor Wolf, let me tell you what, between now and Nov. 6, you'd better put a catcher’s mask on your face because I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes,"" Wagner said in the video.
Wagner later took the ad down amid criticism from national Republican leaders, saying he had ""chosen a poor metaphor.""
New York Republican Representative John Faso has repeatedly run spots against his Democratic challenger, a black former Rhodes scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, highlighting offensive language Antonio Delgado used as a young aspiring rapper.
Delgado responded by saying his past lyrics were taken out of context in an attempt to ""otherize"" him from voters in one of the whitest districts of the state.
California Republican Representative Duncan Hunter ran a spot accusing his challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, of trying ""to hide his family's ties to terrorism."" The ad focuses on his heritage – his mother is Mexican-American and his father is Palestinian. It calls him a ""Palestinian, Mexican, millennial Democrat"" who is funded by ""the Muslim Brotherhood"" and a ""security risk.""
Campa-Najjar worked in President Barack Obama's White House and later in the Department of Labor - jobs that require security clearance. Although his Palestinian grandfather, Muhammad Yusuf al-Najjar, was accused by Israel of being involved in the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, Campa-Najjar was born 16 years after Yusuf al-Najjar died. 
Democratic candidates for Congress in Ohio and California have been similarly labeled for their respective work at a law firm that once handled lawsuits involving Libya and for having been a substitute English teacher at a Muslim high school.

U.S. news website ProPublica last week detailed allegations that before 2014 the charity's Liberian co-founder, Macintosh Johnson, sexually assaulted at least 10 girls over several years including on MTM property. The report has sparked outrage among Liberians.   
Johnson was arrested in 2014 and died of AIDS two years later in prison while awaiting re-trial for alleged rape.
MTM and MTM officials in the United States did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday
In a statement last week, the U.S. charity said its leadership should have recognized warning signs that Johnson was abusing children. ""To all the girls who were raped by Macintosh Johnson in 2014 and before: we failed you,"" it said. 
In a letter on its website, MTM said it would cooperate fully with the Liberian investigation, and it retained U.S. law firm McLane Middleton to conduct an external audit of the organization. It also said that when the charity learned of Johnson's crimes in 2014, the group immediately reported them to the Liberian government and took action to prevent a recurrence.
A Liberian committee representing the ministers of gender, justice, education, health, youth, labor and finance has been established to investigate the matter, said Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection Williametta Saydee Tarr on Friday.
Tarr said the committee would request the Liberian and American cell phone records of Katie Meyler, an American who founded MTM in 2008 with the stated aim of protecting vulnerable girls from sexual exploitation. Meyler did not immediately respond to a request for comment via LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
In the letter posted on MTM's website, the group said that Meyler had taken a leave of absence and the board chairman had resigned. 
MTM now runs 19 Liberian schools with around 4,000 students and has received more than $600,000 in financing from the U.S. government, according to ProPublica.  
Tarr said the committee wished to question all MTM employees. The education ministry will review the teaching credentials of MTM teachers and enact laws to set minimum requirements for expatriate teachers and principals, Tarr said. 
MTM's statement last week said the Liberian education ministry was welcome to inspect its flagship academy at any time. 
""The president does not take lightly to this embarrassment, which threatens and most importantly puts our children at risk,"" Eugene Fahngon, Liberia's deputy minister of information, told Reuters after the news conference. 
Meyler's work has been praised by former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sireaf, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey. In 2014, Time Magazine named her and others fighting Liberia's Ebola epidemic as its Person of the Year.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia's parliament on Friday approved a proposal to change the country's name, bringing a decades-old dispute with Greece one step closer to being resolved.
A total of 80 deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favor of renaming the Balkan country Republic of North Macedonia - just reaching the two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional changes.
The move could unblock its bids to join NATO and the European Union, long blocked by Greece, which argues that ""Macedonia"" implied territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name. 
The two countries reached agreement on the name change in June.
But hurdles remain before the change can be formalized.
A referendum on the agreement failed to pass the turnout threshold of 50 percent, leaving it up to the Skopje parliament to settle the issue. 
The procedure to complete constitutional changes is lengthy and requires several rounds of voting, with Friday's being just the first stage. The procedure should be completed by January at the latest. 
""Today is a historic day for the country,"" Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said. 
""Macedonia will be part of the European family our dreams and visions for better life in a better country will be fulfilled.""
Once Macedonia formally changes the constitution, the Greek parliament will also have to vote on the deal.
Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, who heads a small right-wing party that props up the government in the legislature, has threatened to quit the coalition if the Greek vote goes ahead.
""A great day for democracy in Skopje,"" Johannes Hahn, the EU's commissioner in charge of enlargement, wrote on his Twitter account.

“A meeting is likely sometime after the first of the year,"" the U.S. official told a small group of reporters.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday he hopes to meet his North Korean counterpart soon to lay the groundwork for a ""big step forward"" on denuclearization during the next summit.
Pompeo, in an interview with Voice of America on a trip to Mexico City, said Kim told him two weeks ago he was committed to the promises he had made to Trump during their first summit.
""I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my counterpart to continue this discussion so that when the two of them get together there is real opportunity to make another big step forward on denuclearization,"" he told VOA.

A State Department spokeswoman declined to clarify if Pompeo meant he would meet his counterpart in Washington, saying she had no meetings to announce. 
The United States and South Korea on Friday said they had suspended upcoming joint air defense drills in a bid to ensure diplomatic efforts with North Korea continue.

The two Koreas have held three summits this year.

QUITO (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a lawsuit in Ecuador against new terms of asylum in the Andean country's London embassy that require him to pay for medical bills and phone calls and clean up after his pet cat, his lawyer said on Friday.
Ecuador this month created the new protocol governing his stay at the embassy. Lawyer Baltasar Garzon told a press conference in Quito that the rules were drawn up without consulting the Australian national, who has sued Foreign Minister Jose Valencia in a Quito court to have them changed. 
Assange has not had access to the internet since it was cut off in March, Garzon added, despite a WikiLeaks statement this week that it had been restored.
""He has been held in inhuman conditions for more than six years,"" Garzon said. ""Even people who are imprisoned have phone calls paid for by the state,"" he added, describing the obligations regarding the cat as ""denigrating.""
Garzon said Valencia was named in the lawsuit because he serves as the intermediary between Assange and the Ecuadorean government.
Valencia said the government ""will respond in an appropriate manner."" 
""The protocol is in line with international standards and Ecuadorean law,"" he told reporters in the Ecuadorean city of Daule on Friday. 
Assange's stay has become an increasing annoyance for Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno, who has said the asylum cannot be eternal but has been reluctant to push him out of the embassy on concern for his human rights.
Assange believes he would be handed over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks' publication of hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents. 
Former Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in 2012 granted Assange asylum as he sought to avoid extradition to Sweden for interrogation on alleged sexual assault crimes.
Sweden later dropped its investigation of Assange, but Britain says he will be arrested for violating the terms of his bail if he leaves the embassy.

Ecuador in 2017 gave Assange citizenship and named him to a diplomatic post in Russia, but rescinded the latter after Britain refused to give him diplomatic immunity, according to an Ecuadorean government document seen by Reuters.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","Eyed in Middle East; Australians vote in by-election, government's majority at stake","By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Voting began in a Australian by-election on Saturday that could determine how long Scott Morrison's two-month-old premiership lasts, with the outcome keenly watched in the Islamic world after Morrison's brazen bid to woo Jewish voters.
Morrison, Australia's sixth prime minister in eight years, needs the ruling Liberal Party to hold onto Wentworth, an affluent Sydney harborside constituency, to keep his center-right coalition government's one-seat majority in parliament.
The seat was vacated by Morrison's predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted in August by in-fighting among Liberal lawmakers. 
To boost his party's appeal in a constituency where 13 percent of voters are Jewish, Morrison proposed that Australia could follow U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial decision last December by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving its embassy there. 
Arab diplomats expressed their worries to Canberra this week, and neighboring Indonesia, the country with the biggest Muslim population, warned that Australia was risking its trade and business relationship with the entire Islamic world.
Dave Sharma, the Liberal candidate in Wentworth, is a former Australian ambassador to Israel who is credited with first making the proposal to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 Middle East war, as its capital.
The Jerusalem proposal was the most controversial element of an already heated campaign. Turnbull's own son called on voters to shun the Liberal Party, while Sharma was scolded for using an unauthorized endorsement from a prominent rabbi.
Sharma's strongest rival is Kerryn Phelps, an independent candidate, who has said during campaigning that defense, trade and security implications need to be considered for any decision to be taken on Jerusalem. 
Should the government fail to win Wentworth, it will need support from independent lawmakers to survive any no confidence motions.
Two independents have already ruled out supporting the government, and others have warned Morrison that he will have to pay a hefty price for their backing.
While the gambit on Jerusalem has been welcomed by some members of Wentworth's Jewish community, the proposal has hardened the views of others.
""I’m not thinking of voting Liberal anyway, but doing things like this makes me more inclined to vote Greens,"" said Jo Sharp, a 47-year-old resident, referring to the left-wing party.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 04:42PM ET</span>",Trump criticized for praising congressman who body-slammed reporter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump reiterated his support for a Montana congressman who body-slammed a reporter last year, even as he came under criticism on Friday from U.S. lawmakers and press organizations.
Trump's praise for Greg Gianforte, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who pleaded guilty to an assault charge for the incident involving the reporter, coincides with an international outcry over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
""Any guy that can do a body-slam, he's my guy,"" Trump told a political rally in Missoula, Montana on Thursday night, referring to Gianforte. 
Trump has been holding frequent rallies before the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections in which Trump's fellow Republicans seek to retain control of the House and Senate.
Gianforte body-slammed Ben Jacobs, a correspondent for Britain's Guardian newspaper, in May 2017, the day before a special election to fill Montana's only House seat. Gianforte, who is running for re-election, pleaded guilty. 
On Friday, asked whether he regretted praising Gianforte amid the Khashoggi controversy, Trump said he did not.
""That was a different league, a different world ... Greg is a tremendous person. He's a tough cookie,"" Trump told reporters.
Trump drew rebukes from several lawmakers including U.S. Senators Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, as well as Gianforte's Democratic opponent Kathleen Williams, and from the spokeswoman for the United Kingdom's prime minister.
""In dictatorships, they don't have freedom of speech. They do attack reporters. They do body-slam reporters. We should not be encouraging that in the United States. We should be the beacon of freedom,"" Leahy told CNN, and called Trump's comments ""terrible"" and ""irresponsible.""
Theresa May's spokeswoman told reporters on Friday: ""He obviously made comments at a political rally, and those are for him. But more generally we would always say that any violence or intimidation against a journalist is completely unacceptable.""
Trump has frequently criticized journalists, calling the news media the ""enemy of the American people"" and deriding some news organizations as ""fake news.""
Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, accused Trump of ""cheerleading for a violent act targeting a free and independent news media"" in a statement.
But some dismissed the criticism. 

Rep. Steve Scalise, a House Republican leader and a victim of a shooting last year, said in a tweet: ""President Trump was clearly ribbing Congressman Gianforte for last year's incident ... He was not encouraging his supporters to engage in attacks.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Proposals made by Brazil's far-right presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro present a serious threat to the country's environment that could lead deforestation ""to explode,"" a group of non-government organizations said on Friday.
More than 20 NGOs, including Greenpeace and WWF-Brasil, signed the open letter taking aim at several proposals, calling for Brazilians to take action to protect the environment as a runoff vote approaches on Oct. 28.
Among a long list of complaints, the NGOs criticized ""the announcement of a possible exit of Brazil from the Paris Agreement.""
Bolsonaro has said he could take Brazil out of the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, following in the footsteps of U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The NGO letter did not mention Bolsonaro by name.
Brazil is home to roughly 60 percent of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's largest tropical rainforest that is considered by many as nature's best defense against global warming, with its trees absorbing huge amounts of carbon dioxide.
The letter also condemned plans to combine the environment and agriculture ministry, as suggested by Bolsonaro's top agriculture adviser last week.

""The subordination of these functions to agriculture, in addition to demonstrating a lack of knowledge of the subject, would generate insurmountable conflicts of interest and jeopardize four decades of progress in protecting the environment,"" the letter said.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 03:51PM ET</span>","Afghans set to vote amid chaos, corruption and Taliban threats","KABUL (Reuters) - Afghans vote on Saturday in parliamentary elections overshadowed by chaotic organization, allegations of corruption and the threat of violence after decades of war.
The United Nations, which has been supporting the process, has urged Afghans to ""use this opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote"" and called for the election to take place in a safe and secure environment.
Officials worry that violence will keep voters away from polling stations, particularly following the assassination of the police chief of Kandahar on Thursday.
Taliban militants have issued a series of statements telling people not to take part in what they consider a foreign-imposed process and warning election centers may be attacked. 
Thousands of police and soldiers have been deployed across the country but already nine candidates have been assassinated and hundreds of people killed and wounded in election-related attacks.
Election authorities originally planned 7,355 polling centers but only 5,100 will be able to open due to security concerns, according to the Independent Election Commission, overseeing the vote.
Voting has been postponed for at least a week in Kandahar province following the killing of police commander Gen. Abdul Razeq. It has also been delayed in Ghazni province, by arguments about the representation of different ethnic groups.
FRAUD FEARS
Widespread allegations of voter fraud present a challenge to the legitimacy of the process, seen by Afghanistan's international partners as a vital step ahead of the more important presidential election next year.
Afghan politics is still poisoned by the aftermath of a disputed presidential vote in 2014 that forced the two main rival groupings to form an unstable partnership. Both sides were accused of massive electoral cheating.
Political sleaze has put Afghanistan near the bottom of Transparency International's world corruption index.
""Fraud, the abuse of power and corruption are going to be the main challenge, much more than security,"" said Aziz Rafiee, a political analyst and executive director of the Afghan Civil Society Forum.
Some 8.8 million voters have been registered but an unknown number, by some estimates as many as 50 percent, are believed to be fraudulently or incorrectly registered. 
About 2,450 candidates are competing for 250 seats in the lower house. Under the constitution, parliament reviews and ratifies laws but has little real power. 
In a bid to ensure the vote is fair, biometric voter registration technology has been rushed in at the last minute.

But many fear the untried technology, which was still being distributed to provincial voting centers as recently as Thursday, will add to the confusion without eliminating fraud.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 03:13PM ET</span>",Judge drops some charges against ex-Trump campaign aide Manafort,"By Jan Wolfe and Mark Hosenball
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Friday agreed to drop criminal charges against Paul Manafort that a jury deadlocked on in August, as a federal judge set a Feb. 8 date for the former Trump campaign manager's sentencing on charges of bank fraud and filing false tax returns.
Prosecutors had initially favored waiting until Manafort finished cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election before addressing the remaining charges.
But U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis rejected the timetable so he could move forward with sentencing Manafort, who appeared in court in a wheelchair and was said to be suffering significant health issues.
""I have not heard any estimation from the government of when his cooperation will be complete,"" Ellis said, referring to the special counsel investigation. ""I'm not willing to go on endlessly"" before sentencing Manafort, he added.
Uzo Asonye, a lawyer for the government, told Ellis it was not clear when Manafort's cooperation would be completed. The Special Counsel's Office also said it would not oppose Ellis' new timetable.
Ellis dropped the charges on which the jury had deadlocked but did so without prejudice, meaning the prosecution could reintroduce them at a later date. He set the Feb. 8 sentencing date for the tax and bank fraud charges on which Manafort was convicted.
At his trial in August, Manafort was convicted on eight counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. But the jury was unable to reach a verdict on 10 other charges, including failure to register foreign bank accounts and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, so a mistrial was declared on those. 
Ellis' decision to push ahead with sentencing could result in Manafort receiving a higher prison sentence at first, which prosecutors could then seek to have reduced if he furthers the Mueller probe.
Several sentencing experts predicted Manafort, a 69-year-old former political consultant, would receive a prison term of about 10 years.
Manafort is the most senior of President Donald Trump's former aides to be convicted in Mueller's Russia investigation.
Prosecutors accused him of hiding from U.S. tax authorities $16 million he earned as a political consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine to fund an opulent lifestyle, and then lying to banks to secure $20 million in loans after his Ukrainian income dried up and he needed cash.
The charges largely predated Manafort’s tenure on Trump’s successful presidential campaign in 2016.
After months of refusing to assist Mueller's probe, Manafort finally took a plea deal in September and agreed to cooperate in return for reduced charges.
Manafort appeared in court in green prison uniform that said ""Alexandria inmate."" He was in a wheelchair and had a bandage on his right foot. A source familiar with his health said he had a ""serious medical condition related to his diet.""

Manafort had asked permission to wear a suit but Ellis rejected the request, saying he should be treated no differently from other defendants in custody post-conviction.

AMRITSAR, India (Reuters) - A commuter train traveling at high speed ran through a crowd of people on the rail tracks in northern India killing at least 59 people on Friday, state officials said, making it India's worst rail disaster this year.
Video footage from the scene showed hundreds had gathered to watch the burning of an effigy as part of the Dussehra festival celebrations, when a commuter train ran through the crowd. 
""We have 59 confirmed dead. The toll can rise,"" State police chief Suresh Arora told Reuters, adding emergency officials were still trying to ascertain the extent of the disaster on the outskirts of Amritsar in Punjab state. 
A Reuters witness at the scene saw bodies of victims strewn around rail tracks, friends and relatives stood around in shock, many were sobbing and appeared distraught. 
An officer in the police control room said it was hard to confirm the toll as there were dismembered body parts all over. 
Reuters partner ANI, a domestic news agency, reported that the Chief Medical Officer of the Civil Hospital in Amritsar said 60 people were killed and at least 51 people were injured. Reuters could not immediately confirm that death toll.
Police said it was ""freak accident"" as people did not hear the train approaching amid the din of festivities and fireworks.
During the festival of Dussehra people all over the country set aflame large effigies of a 10-headed demon from the Hindu epic Ramayana in a ceremony that symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. 
In Amritsar, video footage showed the effigy of the demon Ravana had just been lit and firecrackers were going off when the train plowed into the crowd, who were craning their necks and applauding the show. 
ANI reported that a witness at the scene said the train that ran over people was traveling at a high speed. 
Amarinder Singh, Punjab chief minister, said he was rushing to Amritsar to supervise relief and rescue operations. 
""We have also ordered an inquiry as to why this incident has taken place,"" Singh told ANI, adding he did not know why the Dussehra celebrations were being held so close to the railway tracks.
DECADES OF UNDERINVESTMENT
Singh declared a state of mourning and said all offices and educational institutions across the state would remain closed on Saturday. 
A witness told Indian television channel Times Now that relatives of some of the deceased were picking up dead bodies by themselves and no proper rescue operations were currently taking place.
Bodies of victims lay strewn around the scene and local television stations showed distraught and angry people, including a weeping mother who just lost a child.
""Lot of students were gathered here and we can see so many unknown bodies lying around and there is not even enough light here even now,"" one person on the scene told a local channel.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was extremely saddened by the train accident. 
""The tragedy is heart-wrenching,"" he tweeted. ""My deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones and I pray that the injured recover quickly. Have asked officials to provide immediate assistance that is required.""
India's state railways, largely built during colonial rule, have an appalling safety record after decades of underinvestment in rail safety infrastructure, as the priority has remained more on keeping fares low for the 23 million passengers who use the network daily.

Seven people were killed and 21 were injured earlier this month when nine coaches of the New Farakka Express derailed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

MEXICO CITY/CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico's government on Friday vowed to meet the challenge of a caravan of Central American migrants heading north that has angered U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to shut down the U.S-Mexico border to halt its passage.
Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met in Mexico City and discussed the caravan of several thousand people, which set off from Honduras last weekend, and is now at Mexico's border with Guatemala.
""It's a challenge that Mexico is facing, and that's how I expressed it to Secretary Pompeo,"" Videgaray told a news conference alongside his U.S. counterpart.
On Friday afternoon, hundreds of the migrants poured through Guatemala's frontier posts toward the closed Mexican border on a bridge spanning the Suchiate River that bisects the two countries, Mexican television footage showed.
Mexico's government has sought assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help process migrants claiming refugee status at the border, which could allow it to disperse the train of people and placate Trump.
Pompeo said he and Videgaray spoke of the importance of stopping the caravan before it reaches the U.S. border. Pompeo thanked Mexico for its efforts to address the migrant flow, including calling in the United Nations for assistance.
Several thousand Honduran migrants seeking to escape violence and poverty moved through Guatemala on the way to Mexico, with some hoping to enter the United States.
Earlier on Friday, Videgaray said the caravan had close to 4,000 people and that the migrants could individually present their claims to enter Mexico or seek refugee status.
""We haven't had a caravan or group of this size seeking refuge at the same time, that's why we've sought the support of the United Nations,"" Videgaray told Mexican television.
POLICE ON BORDER
Dozens of police in riot gear were deployed along the river bank in the town of Ciudad Hidalgo on Mexico's border with Guatemala as hundreds of migrants prepared to cross over from the Guatemalan town of Tecun Uman on the other side.
Mexico says the migrants will be processed and that those without a legitimate case to travel onwards or stay in Mexico will be returned to their countries of origin.
UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley said the agency is reinforcing capacity in southern Mexico to offer counseling, legal assistance and humanitarian aid to asylum-seekers.
""UNHCR is concerned that the mobilization of such a large number of people in a single group will overwhelm the capacities that exist in the region,"" he told a news conference.
A caravan of Central Americans that formed in southern Mexico in late March also drew the ire of Trump, who on Thursday threatened to deploy the military and close the southern U.S. border if Mexico did not halt the latest procession.
Such a move by Trump would cause chaos on the border, one of the world's busiest, and badly disrupt trade.
However, by the end of Thursday, the U.S. president was also thanking Mexico for its efforts to contain the caravan.

In contrast to the earlier caravan, which moved deeper into the interior of Mexico before officials began intensive efforts to process the migrants, the Mexican government has focused on the new group right on its southern border with Guatemala.

Arrangements for the United Kingdom's only land border with a European Union state have proven the biggest sticking point as London and Brussels seek to hammer out a transitional deal before Britain leaves the European Union in March next year.
Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said just a week ago that the so-called backstop designed to prevent a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, must be finite, short and time-limited.
However, Bloomberg reported that May and her team of Brexit advisers now accepted the EU's point that it must be open-ended, for an ""enduring"" solution, citing an unnamed person familiar with the talks.
Brexit supporters in May's government are concerned any temporary arrangements with the EU that lack a clear time limit may become permanent solutions over time.
Sterling strengthened by around a quarter of a cent against both the U.S. dollar and the euro after the report's publication.

May's office had no immediate comment on the report. Earlier on Friday she told businesses that other EU leaders wanted to reach a Brexit deal as soon as possible, and that any Northern Irish backstop would only be temporary.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi questioned Turkish employees of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Friday, widening the hunt for clues in a case straining Riyadh's alliance with Western powers.
Khashoggi went missing more than two weeks ago after entering the consulate to obtain documents in relation to a forthcoming marriage. Turkish officials believe he was killed in the building on Oct. 2, but Riyadh has denied the allegations.
In an expanding quest for evidence, police searched a forest on Istanbul's outskirts and a city near the Sea of Marmara for Khashoggi's remains, two senior Turkish officials told Reuters, after tracking the routes of cars that left the Saudi consulate and the consul's residence on the day he vanished.
Investigators have recovered samples from searches of both buildings which it will analyze for traces of Khashoggi's DNA.
State-run Anadolu news agency said the Turkish prosecutor's office had taken testimonies by 20 consulate employees, and 25 more people including foreign nationals would be questioned as part of the investigation.
The consulate employees questioned as witnesses included accountants, technicians and a driver, Anadolu said. The investigation is being carried out by the prosecutor's terrorism and organized crime bureau, it added.
Turkey said on Friday it had not shared audio recordings purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate, dismissing reports it had passed them to the United States.
Turkish pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak has published what it said were details from the audio, including that his torturers severed Khashoggi's fingers during an interrogation and later beheaded and dismembered him.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara had not shared information with any country, adding, ""We will share the results that emerge transparently with the whole world.""
The disappearance and presumed death of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, has caused an international outcry and strained relations between Saudi Arabia and Western allies.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has painted himself as the face of a vibrant new kingdom, diversifying its economy away from oil and introducing some social changes. But other moves have faced criticism, including involvement in the Yemen war, the arrest of women activists, and a diplomatic row with Canada.
KING INTERVENES
Khashoggi's disappearance has tarnished his reputation and deepened questions about his leadership, prompting the king to intervene, five sources with links to the Saudi royal family told Reuters.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and senior ministers from France, Britain and the Netherlands have abandoned plans to attend an Oct. 23-25 investor conference in Riyadh, putting the event in question.
On Friday, the CEOs of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and ABB, plus Airbus' defense chief and energy historian Daniel Yergin joined a growing list of Western business executives who have pulled out.
But Pakistan's prime minister and a delegation led by Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev plan to participate, while Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) is sending senior representatives.
A pro-government Turkish daily published preliminary evidence last week from investigators who it said had identified a 15-member Saudi intelligence team that arrived in Istanbul on diplomatic passports hours before Khashoggi disappeared.
One name matches a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for a forensic expert who has worked at the interior ministry for 20 years. Another matches a former diplomat at the Saudi Embassy in London. Others resemble officers in the Saudi Army and Air Force.
A New York Times report, citing witnesses and other records, linked four suspects to Prince Mohammed's security detail.
Turkish pro-government newspaper Sabah also published time-stamped photos it said showed a man, who appears to travel sometimes with the Saudi crown prince, outside the consulate on the morning Khashoggi disappeared.
""VERY SERIOUS MATTER""
U.S. President Donald Trump has appeared unwilling to distance himself too much from the Saudis, citing Riyadh's role in countering Iranian influence in the region and tens of billions of dollars in potential arms deals.
He has said he believes Khashoggi is dead and the U.S. response will likely be ""very severe"" but he wanted to get to the bottom of what happened. He previously speculated without providing evidence that ""rogue killers"" could be responsible.
Trump, who has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, says Washington has asked Turkey for any audio or video evidence, while Pompeo said Riyadh should be given a few more days to complete its own probe.
U.S. intelligence agencies are increasingly convinced of Prince Mohammed's culpability in the operation against Khashoggi, which they believe resulted in his death, a U.S. government source said.
The foreign ministers of Britain and Germany said on Friday that the allegations regarding Khashoggi would be totally unacceptable if true.

Arab allies have rallied to support Riyadh, with UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash denouncing what he called ""attempts to undermine Saudi stability"".

The study, led by Russell King of the University of Sussex and Albanian researcher Ilir Gedeshi, found that the country's potential migration had grown from 44 percent in 2007 to 52 percent in 2018.
Since Albania toppled communism in 1991, more than 1.4 million Albanians, nearly half the current population of the Balkan country, have emigrated mostly to neighboring Italy and Greece and less to the Britain, Germany and the United States.
The study showed economic motives were still the main factor, but less so, and that those mulling migration now prefer Germany and the U.S.
Some 65,000 Albanians applied for asylum in Germany in 2015-16, with most of them rejected as it began welcoming Syrians fleeing war at home. Germany has since begun welcoming doctors and nurses, almost all new graduates.
As the global and economic crisis since 2008 hit the economies of Italy and Greece, home to about one million Albanians, remittances to Albania, key to alleviating poverty, shrunk by one third and 133,544 migrants came back home.
""The unemployed, unskilled and uneducated were potential migrants earlier. Now the skilled, the educated with a job and good economic standing want to migrate,"" Gedeshi told Reuters.
""We also found out economic reasons mattered less because people now want to migrate for better education. A group also wants to leave because they see no future in Albania,"" he added.
Given the rising educational profile of potential migrants, the study recommended Albania sought agreements on ""managed skilled migration, always bearing in mind the dangers of brain and skills drain"".
""Efforts should also be made to improve and broaden the structure of employment and business opportunities in Albania so that fewer people are pessimistic about their future in Albania and see migration as the 'only way out'"", it added.

An Israeli military spokeswoman said about 10,000 demonstrators massed at the border and that some threw burning tires, grenades and explosive devices at the troops across the fence. 
But the protest was relatively small - some of the previous gatherings included about 30,000 people, a sign that tensions that have built up in the past few days may be easing.
On Thursday Israel had ramped up armored forces along the Gaza border, a day after a rocket fired from the enclave destroyed a home in southern Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed ""very strong action"" if attacks continued.
A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Egyptian security officials had held separate meetings in the past few days with Israeli counterparts and with leaders of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas group that rules Gaza in an effort to prevent an escalation in violence.
Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of the territory and the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel’s founding in 1948.
About 200 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops since the protests started, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures, and an Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper. 
Palestinians have also launched incendiary balloons and kites from Gaza into Israel and on occasion breached the Israeli frontier fence.

More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the narrow coastal enclave. Israel pulled troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the past decade.

New Yorkers queuing up to buy tickets for Friday's lottery said they would use the prize money to go on a shopping spree, quit their jobs and donate to charity. Still, anyone who becomes a Mega Millions billionaire is likely to have a lot left over.
The $1 billion prize has attracted attention even from those who do not ordinarily buy lottery tickets.
""I get caught up in the frenzy, and you don’t want to get left behind,” said Venice Naidoo, a client operations specialist at a law firm.
Mega Millions tickets are sold in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. 
If more than one winner is picked, the jackpot would be divided proportionately, as happened when the previous Mega Millions record of $656 million was drawn in March 2012 and was shared by winners in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland, a lottery official said.
The televised drawing for the jackpot, which rose steadily from $667 million on Tuesday when no one had the lucky six numbers, will take place on Friday at 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT Saturday). 
""This is truly uncharted territory, and it's exciting to see people across the country buying their tickets and joining in the fun,"" Gordon Medenica, lead director of Mega Millions, said in a statement. 
The $1 billion Mega Millions prize would be paid out over 29 years. A winner could opt instead for an immediate payment of $565.6 million.
Powerball, which holds the record for the largest U.S. lottery prize of $1.586 billion in 2016, will hold a separate drawing on Saturday. Its jackpot grew on Friday to $470 million from $430 million, with a lump sum value of $268.6 million.
Each of the 24 semi-weekly Mega Millions drawings have failed to produce a top winner since July 24, when an 11-member office pool in Santa Clara County, California, hit a $543 million jackpot.
The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 302,575,350, but the odds of winning any of the lesser prizes are one in 24.

Even though no one won the top prize at Tuesday's drawing, lottery officials noted that there were more than 4.5 million winning tickets, including eight that paid $1 million each and one that paid $5 million.

Judge Cesar Hinostroza's escape to Spain through normal border exit points has embarrassed Vizcarra, who has made fighting graft the top priority in his seven-month-old government.
""He's now with Spanish police, foreign affairs agents and Peru's police attache,"" Vizcarra said on local broadcaster RPP.
Hinostroza had been barred by court orders from leaving the country while he is investigated for influence peddling and other crimes. 
He has been at the center of a cronyism scandal since his phone conversations recorded by police in a drug trafficking probe were leaked to media, allegedly revealing what prosecutors have described as a criminal network of judges who traded favors with politicians and businessmen.
Hinostroza has denied committing any crimes and could not be reached for comment on Friday.
Vizcarra accepted the resignation of his interior minister on Wednesday after his government confirmed Hinostroza had left the country via Ecuador on Oct. 7.
Peru's migrations agency said Hinostroza appeared to have been helped by a government official who has since been suspended and reported to prosecutors.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Cambodia failed on Friday to allay criticisms of authoritarianism and rights abuses that threaten the country's duty-free trading access to the European Union, the EU's top diplomat said after talks with its premier.
Brussels began a formal procedure this month to strip Cambodia of its special trade status, worth billions of euros a year, following July elections that returned strongman Hun Sen to power after 30 years in office and gave his party all parliamentary seats.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini held talks with the prime minister in Brussels during a summit of 51 European and Asian leaders. She said later she had not heard anything that would avert trade sanctions.
""We discussed this, I cannot say that we found solutions to any of these issues,"" Mogherini told a news conference. 
""There is a lot of concern in Europe ... about the dissolution of the opposition and the narrowed democratic space for political opposition and civil society.""
The bloc's review of Cambodia's duty-free access to the EU means Cambodian sugar, garments and other exports could face tariffs within 12 months under EU rules and make the country less attractive for retailers exporting to Europe. 
EU countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia's foreign sales in 2016. Clothing factories employ around 700,000 workers. 
Its exports to the European Union were worth 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) last year, according to EU data, up from negligible levels less than a decade ago, before the trade status.
MYANMAR ALSO ACCUSED
Dozens of Cambodians gathered outside the summit venue in Brussels to protest against Hun Sen's policies. 
He declined to answer questions from reporters, waving his hand and walking away when asked if he was concerned about the impending sanctions.
Mogherini also met Myanmar's Minister for International Cooperation Kyaw Tin in Brussels and raised the prospect of similar trade sanctions to punish the country for what the West says is its ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.
A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar's military of gang rapes and mass killings with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine state and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report, blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.

""We won't close our eyes to violations that the international community sees as worrying,"" Mogherini said. ""Our trade preferences have the respect for human rights at their core.""

Estonia has been under the regulatory spotlight after Denmark's Danske Bank said payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229.90 billion), many of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Earlier this month, U.S. authorities launched an investigation into Danske's activities in Estonia.
Estonia's Anti-Money Laundering Commission has been tasked with drawing up a set of proposals on strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) legislative measures, which is due to be presented to the government in October.
The October proposals to the government will also report on the actions of the financial regulator, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the prosecution authority in relation to their actions in the Danske Bank case.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:39PM ET</span>","As Khashoggi crisis grows, Saudi king asserts authority, checks son's power: sources","DUBAI (Reuters) - So grave is the fallout from the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi that King Salman has felt compelled to intervene, five sources with links to the Saudi royal family said.
Last Thursday, Oct. 11, the king dispatched his most trusted aide, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, governor of Mecca, to Istanbul to try to defuse the crisis. 
World leaders were demanding an explanation and concern was growing in parts of the royal court that the king's son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to whom he has delegated vast powers, was struggling to contain the fallout, the sources said.
During Prince Khaled's visit, Turkey and Saudi Arabia agreed to form a joint working group to investigate Khashoggi's disappearance. The king subsequently ordered the Saudi public prosecutor to open an inquiry based on its findings.
""The selection of Khaled, a senior royal with high status, is telling as he is the king's personal adviser, his right hand man and has had very strong ties and a friendship with (Turkish President) Erdogan,"" said a Saudi source with links to government circles.
Since the meeting between Prince Khaled and Erdogan, King Salman has been ""asserting himself"" in managing the affair, according to a different source, a Saudi businessman who lives abroad but is close to royal circles.
Saudi officials did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about the king's involvement in helping to supervise the crisis. A spokesman for Prince Khaled referred Reuters to government representatives in Riyadh.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and leading critic of Prince Mohammed, vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials say they believe the Saudi journalist was murdered there and his body removed, allegations which Saudi Arabia has strongly denied.
Initially the king, who has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to his son, commonly known as MbS, was unaware of the extent of the crisis, according to two of the sources with knowledge of the Saudi royal court. That was partly because MbS aides had been directing the king to glowing news about the country on Saudi TV channels, the sources said.
That changed as the crisis grew.
""Even if MbS wanted to keep this away from the king he couldn't because the story about Khashoggi's disappearance was on all the Arab and Saudi TV channels watched by the king,"" one of the five sources said.
""The king started asking aides and MbS about it. MbS had to tell him and asked him to intervene when Khashoggi’s case became a global crisis,"" this source said.
Since he acceded to the throne in January 2015, the king has given MbS, his favorite son, increasing authority to run Saudi Arabia. But the king's latest intervention reflects growing disquiet among some members of the royal court about MbS's fitness to govern, the five sources said.
MbS, 33, has implemented a series of high-profile social and economic reforms since his father's accession, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom. 
But he has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi's security and intelligence agencies.
His reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.
Khashoggi's disappearance has further tarnished the crown prince's reputation, deepening questions among Western allies and some Saudis about his leadership.
""Even if he is his favorite son, the king needs to have a comprehensive view for his survival and the survival of the royal family,"" said a fourth Saudi source with links to the royal court.
""In the end it will snowball on all of them.""
Saudi officials did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
MISCALCULATION
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied any role in Khashoggi's disappearance. But the sources familiar with the royal court said the reaction from the United States, an ally for decades, had contributed to the king's intervention.
""When the situation got out of control and there was an uproar in the United States, MbS informed his father that there was a problem and that they have to face it,"" another source with knowledge of the royal court said.
The crown prince and his aides had initially thought the crisis would pass but they ""miscalculated its repercussions"", this source said.
Turkish officials have made clear they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, and two Turkish sources have told Reuters police have audio recordings to back up that assertion. 
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican close to President Donald Trump, on Tuesday accused MbS of ordering Khashoggi's murder and called him a ""wrecking ball"" who is jeopardizing relations with the United States. He did not say what evidence he was basing the allegation on.
Trump said on Thursday he presumed Khashoggi was dead but that he still wanted to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. Asked what would be the consequences for Saudi Arabia, Trump said: ""Well, it'll have to be very severe. I mean, it's bad, bad stuff. But we'll see what happens.""
Trump has previously said ""rogue killers"" may have been responsible and has ruled out cancelling arms deals worth tens of billions of dollars. On Tuesday, Trump said he had spoken with MbS and that the crown prince told him he did not know what had happened in the consulate where Khashoggi went missing.
The case poses a dilemma for the United States, as well as Britain and other Western nations. Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil exporter, spends lavishly on Western arms and is an ally in efforts to contain the influence of Iran.
But in a sign of the damage, a succession of international banking and business chiefs, including IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Ford Chairman Bill Ford, have pulled out of a high-profile investment conference in Saudi Arabia this month. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday also abandoned plans to attend, as did Britain's trade minister and the French and Dutch finance ministers, putting the event in question.
Saudi officials have said they plan to move forward with the conference, scheduled for Oct. 23-25, despite the wave of cancellations.
Neither JP Morgan nor Ford would elaborate on the reasons for the decision not to attend and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor.
Lagarde had previously said she was ""horrified"" by media reports about Khashoggi's disappearance. An IMF spokesperson did not give a reason for her deferring her trip to the Middle East.
TAKING CONTROL
Before the king's intervention, Saudi authorities had been striking a defiant tone, threatening on Sunday to retaliate with greater action against the U.S. and others if sanctions are imposed over Khashoggi's disappearance. A Saudi-owned media outlet warned the result would be disruption in Saudi oil production and a sharp rise in world oil prices.
""Reaction and threats to the possible sanctions of the last 24 hours were still (coming) from the crown prince,"" the businessman close to royal circles said on Monday. ""The king is now holding the file personally ... and the tone is very different.""
The king has spoken directly with Erdogan and Trump in recent days. Both the king and his son met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he visited Riyadh on Tuesday.
King Salman, 82, spent decades as part of the inner circle of the Al Saud dynasty, which long ruled by consensus. In four decades as governor of Riyadh, he earned a reputation as a royal enforcer who punished princes who were out of line. 
Whether he is willing or able to resume that role in this crisis remains unclear, palace insiders say. One source with links to the royal court said the king was ""captivated"" by MbS and ultimately would protect him.
Still, there is precedent for the king's intervention. 
He stepped in this year to shelve the planned listing of national oil company Saudi Aramco, the brainchild of MbS and a cornerstone of his economic reforms, three sources with ties to government insiders told Reuters in August. Saudi officials have said the government remains committed to the plans.
And when MbS gave the impression last year that Riyadh endorsed the Trump administration’s still nebulous Middle East peace plan, including U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the king made a public correction, reaffirming Riyadh's commitment to the Arab and Muslim identity of the city.
Despite these rare instances of pushback, several of the sources close to the royal family said that King Salman had grown increasingly detached from decisions taken by MbS.
""He has been living in an artificially-created bubble,"" said one of the sources. Lately, though, the king's advisers have grown frustrated and begun warning him of the risks of leaving the crown prince's power unchecked.

""The people around him are starting to tell him to wake up to what's happening,"" the source said.

SINGAPORE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea have suspended upcoming joint air defense drills to give diplomatic efforts with North Korea ""every opportunity to continue,"" the U.S. military said on Friday.
The Pentagon said the decision to suspend Exercise Vigilant Ace, which had been scheduled for December, was taken by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, who met in Singapore on Friday.
Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement that the decision had been taken to ""give the diplomatic process every opportunity to continue."" 
""Both ministers are committed to modifying training exercises to ensure the readiness of our forces. They pledged to maintain close coordination and evaluate future exercises,"" White said. 
She added that Mattis had spoken with his Japanese counterpart as well on the issue.
The two Koreas have held three summits this year. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, where the leaders promised to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Vigilant Ace is one of several exercises that have been suspended since the summit to encourage dialogue aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. 
Last year, Vigilant Ace had more than 230 aircraft, including six F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, and around 12,000 U.S. service members.
Trump caught many U.S. officials off guard earlier this year when he announced after his summit with Kim that the United States was suspending the summer’s joint military drills with South Korea, known as Ulchi Freedom Guardian.
""If we continue to suspend the major exercises, our military capacity will begin to atrophy,"" said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama.
Denmark said the U.S. military could likely tolerate the suspension of major exercises for about a year before serious challenges to military readiness and capability.
Last month, the Pentagon's pick to be the new commander of U.S. forces in South Korea said the decision to suspend some joint exercises between South Korea and the United States was a ""prudent risk"" but had caused a ""slight degradation"" in military readiness.
Denmark said joint exercises were particularly important as a new commander, U.S. Army General Robert Abrams, takes charge of U.S. forces in South Korea. 
Washington and Seoul both publicly insist they are on the same page about dealing with Pyongyang. But behind the scenes, there are growing signs of disagreement as South and North Korea forge ahead with plans to defuse military tensions and rebuild economic ties.

""The U.S. continues to make these major, substantive concessions and the North Koreans continue to drag out any sort of diplomatic process towards denuclearization,"" Denmark said.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Archbishop critical of Pope Francis denies wanting to topple him,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A conservative Italian archbishop who has publicly criticized Pope Francis over a sexual misconduct case on Friday denied he was trying to foment an overthrow of the papacy.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who is now in hiding, threw the Roman Catholic Church into turmoil in August when he called on the pope to resign, accusing him of covering up sexual misconduct by a now-disgraced senior churchman in the United States.
Vigano has also charged Pope Francis with turning a blind eye to what he said were homosexual networks in the Church.
In his latest statement issued on Friday through an ultra-conservative Italian journalist, Vigano no longer called for the pope to step down.
""It does not surprise me...that I have been accused of disloyalty towards the Holy Father and of fomenting an open and scandalous rebellion,"" he said.
""But rebellion would imply urging others to overthrow the papacy. I am exhorting no such thing. I pray every day for Pope Francis more than I ever did for the other pope,"" he wrote in Italian.
Vigano, who has been defended by powerful Catholic conservative media, again asserted that the Church was rife with homosexual priests and bishops, a recurring accusation in his missives. 
""There is overwhelming proof of how the scourge of homosexuality is endemic, spreads by contagion, with deep roots that are difficult to pull up,"" said Vigano, a former Vatican ambassador to Washington.
He said that heterosexual misconduct by the clergy was not as insidious as homosexual activity because the former ""does not spread similar behavior, cover up similar misdeeds"".
He also stood by his main assertion that Pope Francis knew about sexual misconduct by Theodore McCarrick, 88, the former archbishop of Washington, but did nothing about it.
Vigano says that Francis lifted sanctions placed by former Pope Benedict on McCarrick. The Vatican denies this, saying there were no sanctions to lift.
In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in
nearly 100 years after U.S. Church officials said allegations that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.
McCarrick, who rose to be a power-broker in the U.S. Church, said he had no recollection of the alleged abuse of the minor and has not commented on other accusations of sexual misconduct with seminarians.
Vigano made his latest broadside nearly two weeks after a point-by-point rebuttal of his original accusations by Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Canadian head of the Vatican department that oversees the office that appoints bishops.
On Oct. 6, the Vatican said the pope had ordered a ""thorough study"" of all documents in Holy See offices concerning
McCarrick to determine how he was able to rise in the U.S. Church hierarchy despite rumors of his sexual misconduct with adult males.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Comoros authorities sign pact to end standoff on island,"MORONI (Reuters) - Five days of clashes between protesters and police in Comoros' Anjouan island have subsided after the national government, local authorities and the Anjouan capital Mutsamudu signed an accord aimed at ending the violence, officials said on Friday.
Anjouan has been shaken by clashes pitting security forces against young men angry at President Azali Assoumani's plans to end a rotating presidency in a way critics say could leave Anjouan permanently excluded from national power.
On Wednesday, the disturbances worsened when government officials said soldiers shot dead two people and wounded four as violence broke out in Mutsamudu between masked men and the military.
Officials from Mutsamudu, Anjouan island and the national government of the Indian Ocean archipelago said they had reached an agreement to end the days of disturbances.
""We cannot speak on behalf of the holders of weapons, since we do not know them. We are here to try to restore calm and a normal life in Mutsamudu,"" Abdallah Mohamed, head of the delegation of Anjouan leadership, told Reuters.
On Thursday, residents said authorities had cut off water and power supplies as part of efforts to quell the unrest.
""The Union's commitment to provide water to Mutsamudu was partly fulfilled, because even in mosques people could not do their washings in the morning,"" Mohamed said.
""I feel that the situation is slowly coming to normality; the army is slowly reducing its control over the city.”
The accord does not address the constitutional question.
African Union said in a statement Tuesday that a dialogue process meant to address it and other political issues was suspended in early October.
The national government said Assoumani had granted amnesty to anyone who would surrender their weapons to the military authorities before 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Friday.
""This person will not be prosecuted and will be able to leave freely to the destination of his choice,"" Mahmoud Salim, Minister of National Education, said.
In August, Assoumani - who is from the largest island, Grande Comore - said a June referendum had approved the extension of presidential term limits and an end to the rotating presidency. The opposition called the referendum illegal.
Assoumani plans to compete in presidential polls in early 2019. That would deny Anjouan its turn to occupy the presidency from 2021, as would have happened under the previous system that rotated the post among the country's three main islands.

Assoumani has been in power since 2016 and would have had to step down in 2021 under the old term limits.

PARIS (Reuters) - High in the French Alps, a helicopter airlifts food, logs and a  Renault  (PA:RENA) Twingo car for the residents of two tiny hamlets left isolated after a rockslide in April.
A heap of rubble and a scar on the hillside are all that remains of the only road to Beroulf and Sainte Sabine, with the 45 residents forced to hike back from work through the forest with dinner in a backpack.
On Wednesday they hired a helicopter to go back and forth 17 times to deliver heavier supplies across the valley. Two thirds of the 3,000 euro ($3,500) cost was borne by the locals, with the remainder paid for by local authorities.
A new road following a different path should be in place in the new year but it will be too late for some in the village. An elderly resident and a doctor recovering from a knee operation have already had to move.
""We're not secure in our everyday lives, in our way of life there's a lack of comfort, and a feeling of what next?"" resident Florence Sebille said.
The painter-decorator said she has had to adapt, cutting green vegetables from her diet and ditching fuel oil this winter as the airlifts are too expensive.
Others worry that things will get worse in the coming winter months as they try and navigate unlit and impractical paths.
""At the moment it's good weather so it's fine but when it rains you have to be prepared. And then the day goes on. You have to think about how you're going to organize yourself,"" said primary school head teacher Laurent Misset.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Russia to send more military trainers, equipment to Central African Republic","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it planned to send additional military equipment to Central African Republic (CAR) and deploy 60 more instructors to train the country's armed forces, escalating its most significant military foray in Africa in decades.
Russia donated hundreds of weapons and sent 175 trainers to CAR earlier this year to bolster the government's fight against militia groups after receiving an exemption from a United Nations arms embargo.
According to diplomatic and security sources, many of the Russians in CAR are private security contractors and their remit has expanded into mediating negotiations among armed groups, securing mining projects and advising CAR's president.
Russia's activities in CAR are part of a wider push to re-establish influence in sub-Saharan Africa that waned after the Cold War. It has signed military cooperation deals with 19 countries since 2015 and expanded diplomatic and trading ties.
In one of its most extensive comments to date on the subject, Russia's foreign ministry defended its actions in a statement against what it said was ""a certain 'jealousy'"" by other foreign powers over Russia's role in CAR. 
""We believe this kind of position to be counter-productive, particularly in the current context, when constructive cooperation of all international 'players' and not competition or 'zero-sum games' is urgently called for,"" it said.
""With the knowledge of a relevant U.N. Security Council committee we are planning to send to CAR an additional 60 civilian instructors and the second part of military purpose products."" 
According to a confidential memo seen by Reuters, the Security Council's 15-member CAR sanctions committee agreed last month to Russia's request to send the 60 additional instructors, provided they coordinate with CAR's U.N. peacekeeping mission.
But France, the United States and Britain placed a hold in August on further arms shipments pending confirmation that measures had been taken to secure the previous donation. 
Estimates of the total number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from 250 to 1,000. The foreign ministry did not respond directly to questions about the presence of private security contractors.
CAR has faced near-constant armed conflict since 2013, when a mostly Muslim Seleka rebel coalition overthrew then-president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisals from Christian 'anti-balaka' militias.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",French lawmaker proposes bill to outlaw mockery of accents,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French member of parliament has proposed that mockery of accents be outlawed, after an irate politician derided a journalist's southwestern pronunciation before asking if anyone had a question in ""understandable French"".
Laetitia Avia of President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party said she was proposing a bill that would classify such mockery with other forms of prohibited discrimination such as on grounds of sex or race.
She did so after a journalist from Toulouse in southwest France asked former presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon about an anti-corruption investigation of his hard-left political party.
In an exchange widely relayed on media and social networks, Melenchon mimicked the journalist's accent and told her she was ""talking nonsense"" before turning away and saying: ""Has anyone got a question in more or less comprehensible French?"" 
The law Avia proposes would proscribe discrimination based on pronunciation, whether standardized or from a specific region of France, or from one of the countries of origin of the many people of African descent in France.
""Do you speak poorer French if you have an accent? Do people have to endure humiliation if their pronunciation is not of the standardized kind,"" she said in a message on Twitter.
She said she was proposing the legislation along with other members of the ruling party, Macron's La Republique en Marche.
""Glottophobia"", a word recently coined by a French linguist to describe discrimination based on pronunciation and tone, needed to discouraged by law, she said. 
Melenchon, who has a reputation as a talented if tempestuous orator, was knocked out in the first round of the election that swept Macron to power in May 2017.
Justice officials are looking into allegations of irregular financing of his party and election campaign. This week they said he was also being investigated for intimidation of magistrates and police officers after an anti-corruption officer was jostled at his party headquarters.
Avia did not specifically say her bill was in reaction to Melenchon's comments but she relayed TV footage of the accent-mocking exchange on her Twitter account shortly after it took place on Oct. 17.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - A former president of an Ethiopian region who was arrested on charges of human rights abuses and stoking deadly ethnic clashes tried to escape by climbing out a window while in police custody ahead of a court appearance, police said on Friday.
Abdi Mohammed Omer, a former administrator of the Somali Region, was forced to resign on Aug. 6 and arrested weeks later after violence broke out in the provincial capital Jijiga.
He has since been accused of presiding over widespread rights abuses that included torture, rapes and killings.
""In his escape attempt, he broke a window before choking a member of the police force,"" the state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation news outlet said, quoting a police statement.
The agency said Abdi subsequently denied the claim in court, and said the accusations were aimed at ""tarnishing his name"".
Rights groups have routinely accused Abdi's administration of abuses such as torture.
At least 20 people died and thousands fled Jijiga as mobs looted properties owned by ethnic minorities and burned down several Ethiopian Orthodox churches during the outbreak of violence in August.
The central authorities said the unrest in the region had been triggered by local officials fearing arrest on human rights abuse charges.
    The Somali Region has been plagued by violence for the last three decades, in which the government fought the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front before the group declared a unilateral ceasefire this month in the wake of reforms.
The province holds four trillion cubic feet of oil and gas reserves, government estimates show. China’s GCL-Poly Petroleum Investments has been developing two gas fields there since 2013.
Ethiopia has been ruled for decades by a government that maintained a strong emphasis on security and tolerated little dissent. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April, has enacted reforms, released political prisoners, made peace with militant groups and reached a rapprochement with regional foe Eritrea.

The suspected attacker was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday's attack, which recalled shootings at schools in the United States. 
Mourners laid flowers and wept as they filed past closed coffins, set out on a public square in the center of the small city of 146,000 people.

""I saw it all - the blood, the corpses,"" he said. ""It was terrifying. We didn't know where to run.""
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday blamed the attack on globalization, saying a problem that began in the United States had spread around the world through online communities on the Internet.
The attack prompted calls for the security services in Russia to have greater control over the Internet.

It was only the second reported attempt by Somali pirates to seize a commercial ship this year, after a resurgence of attacks in 2017 following years of relative calm brought about by regular patrols of the European Union Naval Force (EUNAVOR).
On Tuesday, pirates approached and opened fire at the Hong Kong-flagged MV KSL freighter 340 nautical miles off Somalia, but private security guards aboard the ship acted quickly to foil the attack, EUNAVOR said in a statement.
""Due to the application of BMP (best management practices) protection measures by the master, his crew and the private security team, the piracy attack was thwarted and the crew and vessel remained safe,"" it said.
""There was a sustained exchange of fire before the skiff with several armed people on board broke off and changed course away from the MV,"" it added. Guards had already moved the crew to safe locations before the shooting erupted.
The last reported attack off Somalia's coast was in February, when guards aboard a Singaporean-flagged chemical tanker repulsed pirates who had shot at it.
Pirates once plagued the Indian Ocean shipping lanes off the Horn of Africa, with the peak year in 2011 when 237 attacks were reported and hundreds of hostages taken by pirates to be exchanged for ransom, according to maritime data.
Attacks dramatically subsided after several foreign navies, including from the EU and China, began regular anti-piracy patrols in the area.

Lara Alqasem, 22, was allowed out of Tel Aviv airport on Thursday after Israel's Supreme Court overturned her Oct. 2 detention there on suspicion of being active in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement - charges she denied.
The case has touched off a debate in Israel over whether democratic values were compromised by the 2017 law that bars the entry of foreigners who publicly support boycotts of Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians. Israel's government slammed the Supreme Court ruling as short-sighted.
But a lawyer for Alqasem, who is of Palestinian descent and a former president of a small local chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine group at the University of Florida, hailed the ruling as ""an incredible day for Israeli democracy"".
""We're celebrating, but yesterday was an intermission and the battle goes on,"" the lawyer, Leora Bechor, told Reuters.
Bechor said Israeli legislators appeared poised to draft even tougher laws against suspected pro-Palestinian boycotters.
""The court decision rules that thought-policing has zero place in Israeli democracy. Unfortunately, the court decision fell on deaf ears,"" she said.
Alqasem, who was due to enroll for a year-long master's program at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, voiced relief, in a brief statement issued by her lawyers, at being let into Israel. 
Some BDS activists say they aim to promote Palestinian rights. Others advocate Israel's elimination. Israel describes BDS as anti-Semitic.
Gilad Erdan, one of the Israeli security cabinet ministers charged with implementing the anti-boycotter law, suggested that Alqasem's studies at an Israeli university were no guarantee against future BDS activity.

""We will examine the legal criteria in order to ensure that the original intent of the law is maintained,"" he tweeted in response to the Supreme Court ruling.

Mohammed Dewji, 43-year-old CEO of the METL Group family conglomerate, was seized as he arrived for a morning workout in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam last week. Forbes estimates his net worth as $1.5 billion, making him Africa's 17th richest man and its youngest billionaire.
His family have offered a reward of 1 billion Tanzania shillings ($440,000) for information leading to his release.
Police Inspector General Simon Sirro told reporters in Dar es Salaam that the movements of the car used to seize Dewji had been traced on footage obtained from security cameras before it went out of view while still within Dar es Salaam.
""We have got the information on the car owner and the nationality, the driver who was driving it and our people at Interpol are working on it,"" he said. Interpol is an international body that circulates requests from police forces for cooperation from police in other countries.
Police were also conducting a house-to-house search for the kidnapped businessman, Sirro said.
Tanzania's neighbors include Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique.
METL Group is involved in a diverse range of manufacturing, farming, transport, infrastructure, agroprocessing and telecoms businesses spanning 11 African countries.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A Western boycott of a major business conference in Riyadh next week suggests rising political risks in Saudi Arabia could harm its ambitions to attract foreign capital and diversify its economy away from oil.
Rather than whipping up interest in Saudi investment opportunities, the event risks becoming a public relations debacle because of the disappearance of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, company executives and analysts say.
Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia denies this.
More than two dozen top officials and executives from the United States and Europe, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the chief executives of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC, have canceled plans to attend the Future Investment Initiative due to unease over the Khashoggi affair.
That may not prevent the event from proceeding - over 150 speakers from more than 140 organizations originally signed up, organizers said. But it deprives the conference of much of its star power.
As Western companies fret over the risk to their reputations of doing deals and possible exposure to any sanctions imposed over the Khashoggi case, they are likely to put much new business in Saudi Arabia on hold for now.
The freeze may apply to both new Western contracts or investments in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi government's own program of buying corporate assets abroad through its $250 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF).
""Most Western businesses will come under pressure to reconsider their exposure to Saudi Arabia in light of the Khashoggi affair,"" said Ayham Kamel, head of the Middle East practice of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.
But the freeze on new deals may start to ease within a few months. Many Western firms have too much at stake to abandon the Middle East's biggest economy; privately, some told Reuters they would send lower-level executives to the conference.
BILLIONS AT STAKE
Larry Fink, chief executive of U.S. investment manager BlackRock, said he was pulling out of the conference but would not cut ties with Saudi Arabia as he wanted to ""preserve the relationships that we'd worked so long for"".
Companies in China and Japan have shown little or no sign of withdrawing from the event, so U.S. and European firms may lose out on business if they stay cool toward Riyadh for too long.
""In the new year the impact may start to ease, particularly given that the U.S. seems to be helping Saudi Arabia sweep the incident under the carpet,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to protect Washington's security cooperation with Saudi Arabia and billions of dollars of military equipment sales to Riyadh. He raised the possibility that ""rogue killers"" murdered Khashoggi, a theory which could absolve Saudi leaders from responsibility.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday that allegations about Khashoggi's case would be totally unacceptable if true but he added Britain had a strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia, and that any British action would be ""considered"".
Tuvey and others predicted the cost of any sanctions would be small. The option most widely discussed by U.S. politicians is the so-called Magnitsky Act, which can impose visa bans and asset freezes on individuals over human rights issues.
If a small group of Saudis were found responsible for Khashoggi's death and sanctioned this way, it could be embarrassing for Riyadh but have no significant economic impact.
A Gulf banker who works with Saudi Arabia said that however the Khashoggi affair ended, the opportunities to earn fees arranging deals for the PIF meant Western banks would ultimately be ""back on their knees seeking business"" from it.
After the killing of student protesters in Beijing in June 1989, direct foreign investment in China sank over 20 percent in the first half of 1990 but about a year later, it was once again growing strongly.
Financial market moves show investors are worried about the Khashoggi affair but not nearly as fearful as they were after oil prices began plunging in 2014. 
The Saudi riyal fell in the forwards market and the cost of insuring Saudi debt against default is up, but by small margins compared to past bouts of instability.
LONG TERM
But even after normal business ties with the West resume, Khashoggi may cast a shadow over foreign capital flows into Saudi Arabia. Western companies may be keen to earn fees and win contracts, but perceptions of rising political risk could limit foreign direct investment.
A Gulf banker said she was receiving many queries about the Khashoggi affair from foreign clients as it was the latest in a series of crises under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, including the arrest of scores of officials and businessmen in a corruption purge last year.
""It's cumulative – the Yemen war, the dispute with Qatar, the tensions with Canada and Germany, the arrests of women activists. They add up to an impression of impulsive policy-making, and that worries investors.”
If Riyadh escapes major sanctions over Khashoggi, it may still face a less sympathetic U.S. Congress. This could, for example, lead to a revival of efforts to pass legislation exposing OPEC oil producers to anti-trust lawsuits.
And some fear the affair could weaken the 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's domestic authority, creating political instability or slowing his reform drive, which has included slashing the state budget deficit and lifting a ban on women driving.
The reforms and the corruption crackdown have won Prince Mohammed support among many Saudis, but have also hurt some royal family members and businessmen. The Khashoggi affair could conceivably become the catalyst for a backlash. 

""We're worried that this could derail all the work that has been put in the past year towards the economic and social reforms,"" said a banker in Riyadh.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 08:38AM ET</span>",Afghanistan delays vote in strategic Kandahar after killing of commander,"By Rupam Jain and Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Saturday's parliamentary election in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar will be delayed by a week after the assassination of one of the country's most powerful security chiefs dealt a stunning blow to the Western-backed government.
General Abdul Razeq, the Kandahar police commander, was killed outside the provincial governor's office on Thursday, when a bodyguard opened fire on a group of officials as they left a meeting with General Scott Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
Miller was not wounded but the regional intelligence agency commander was killed and the provincial governor severely wounded, crippling the leadership of one of the country's most strategically important provinces.
Although nominally a provincial police chief, Razeq was one of the most powerful political figures in Afghanistan and a formidable opponent of the Taliban, with unchallenged authority across the volatile south of the country.
The decision to suspend the vote was taken over the objections of some officials who warned that any delay would threaten the whole process and hand the Taliban a major propaganda victory.
Miller himself gave a show of confidence on Friday, filming a television interview on the street outside the U.S. embassy in Kabul and assuring Afghanistan of continued support.
""My message to the people of Afghanistan has been very consistent: you have every right to be proud of your security forces and the preparations that made for this election despite this unfortunate event, tragic event, down in Kandahar,"" he said.
Saturday's election has been seen as a major test of the government's ability to organize a nationwide ballot ahead of the more important presidential election next April.
But the shock of Razeq's death meant the people of Kandahar were ""morally not ready to vote"", Hafizullah Hashimi, spokesman of the Independent Election Commission, said.
The Taliban issued a fresh warning not to vote on Friday, telling people to stay at home and saying they would shut down roads and would be ""closely monitoring all developments"".
The United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a statement of its own expressing concern at Taliban threats to attack schools and other buildings used as polling centers.
""UNAMA urges the Taliban to respect and protect civilians and not to threaten them or carry out violence,"" it said.
On top of mounting security concerns, the elections have been dogged by technical and organizational problems, notably around the use of untested biometric voter verification equipment rushed in after allegations of widespread voter fraud.
PRECARIOUS
Thursday's attack underlined how precarious the situation remains in Afghanistan after more than 17 years of war despite preliminary contacts between Taliban and U.S. officials to find a basis for future peace talks.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it was too soon to say what effect Razeq's death would have but added that the U.S. military's mission was unaltered.
""We need to find who's done this,"" Mattis told reporters traveling with him in the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore. ""But right now, we are going toward the election and we will continue to defend the Afghan people.""
He said the attack would not affect U.S. military movements around Afghanistan or security arrangements for General Miller, who said he did not believe he was the target of the attack. 
It was unclear how the attack would affect moves toward a peace process, following a meeting last week of Taliban officials and the U.S. special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, but it complicates an already difficult situation.
""You're going to start asking questions about, 'Well, how trustworthy are they? What influence do they really have?'"" said one former Defense Department official who left the Pentagon recently, referring to the Taliban.
""And you know the bottomline question is, 'Why are we still dealing with them?' or 'Should we deal with them?'""
However Mattis said the U.S. aim of finding a negotiated political solution was unchanged.
""We remain absolutely committed to an Afghan-led Afghan reconciliation,"" he said.
ELECTION THREAT
Miller, who knew Razeq well from his previous tours of duty in Afghanistan, issued a statement saluting a ""great friend"".
""Afghanistan lost a patriot,"" he said on Twitter. ""The good he did for Afghanistan and the Afghan people cannot be undone.""
A disarmingly youthful-looking figure, with a toothy smile belying a fearsome reputation, the 39-year-old Razeq was regularly accused of building a fortune by extracting millions of dollars from traders and businesses.
He was also accused of torturing prisoners and other abuses, which he denied.
Last year, the United Nations Committee against Torture cited ""numerous and credible allegations"" that Razeq was complicit in severe human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and secret detention centers.
He clashed frequently with President Ashraf Ghani, defying attempts to sack him, but was adept at navigating the region's complex tribal politics and enjoyed popular support in Kandahar and the surrounding provinces.
He was also highly respected by U.S. officers who saw his ruthless methods as the most effective weapon against the Taliban in both Kandahar and the wider south.

""Razeq was, kind of, the embodiment of security, not just in Kandahar. It is Uruzgan, it's Zabul province,"" said the recently retired Defense Department official. ""He had a lot of sway over other senior officials and certainly in the police.""

807,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","Hungary's new Holocaust museum divides Jews, faces 'whitewash' accusations","By Krisztina Than
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A planned new Holocaust museum in Budapest has divided Hungary's Jewish community and triggered international concerns that it will downplay the wartime role of Hungarians in the persecution and deportation of Jews.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government plans to open the museum next year to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the deportati7on of Hungarian Jews to death camps in German-occupied Poland. More than half a million Hungarian Jews were among six million Jews killed in Europe during the Holocaust.
In a Sept. 7 decree the government granted ownership of the new museum, called the House of Fates, to the Unified Hungarian Jewish Congregation (EMIH), one of the three registered Jewish groups in Hungary.
The permanent exhibition, to be set up by the EMIH with government help and housed in a former railway station, will be based on the concept of historian Maria Schmidt, who is an ally of Orban and owns a pro-government weekly.
It will use personal histories to explore the 1938-48 period in Hungary, with particular focus on children, and will also feature temporary exhibitions and education programs.
But the project, first announced in 2014, has drawn criticism from Israel's Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center.
""The museum concept clearly avoids addressing the role and responsibility of... Hungarian leaders of that era for the plight of the nation's Jews, and their eventual abandonment to the hands of Nazi Germany,"" Robert Rozett, Director of the Yad Vashem Libraries, said in a statement last month. 
It also seeks to gloss over the role of ordinary Hungarian citizens, he said. ""It is implied that Hungary was actually a nation of rescuers. This is a grave falsification of history.""
BLOODY HISTORY
The head of EMIH, Rabbi Slomo Koves, said the museum remained open to suggestions from others, including Yad Vashem, adding that only about half of the concept was so far ready. 
Koves said he wanted to give young visitors ""an emotional relation to the story"" along with all relevant context.
Hungary began ostracizing and discriminating against Jews under its right-wing ruler Miklos Horthy long before World War Two, when it was an ally of Nazi Germany. In 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary to stop it switching sides and in just eight weeks, with the collaboration of the authorities, some 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to the Auschwitz death camp.
Tens of thousands of others were herded into ghettos in Budapest and killed, mostly by Hungarians. 
The World Jewish Congress has suggested that Hungary put the museum under the supervision of an international body such as Yad Vashem, the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities (MAZSIHISZ).
The chairman of MAZSIHISZ, Andras Heisler, echoed that call, adding: ""We've received much support from the government but this... dividing of the Jewish community affects us very negatively."" 
Orban told parliament this month the opening of the museum could wait until the disputes surrounding it ""die down"".
Budapest already has a Holocaust Memorial Center in a former synagogue that was opened in 2004.
Orban has repeatedly declared a policy of zero tolerance on anti-Semitism but has also risked angering Jews with remarks about ""ethnic homogeneity"" apparently aimed at right-wing voters and has been accused of trying to whitewash Hungary's past. 
In 2014 Orban's government erected a monument to victims of the Nazi occupation that critics said depicted Hungarians only as passive victims, absolving them of guilt. But Orban has also spoken of ""the very many Hungarians who chose evil over good"".
Gergely Gulyas, Orban's cabinet chief, said the government would bear responsibility for the content of the new museum.

""We bow our heads before the victims of the Holocaust who became victims because the Hungarian state was unable to protect its own citizens and collaborated in the deportations,"" he said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - In one drawing, Lady Justice is seen fleeing Venezuela, a sword in her right hand and a suitcase in the left. 
In another, a crying boy tells his father he does not want school to start again. His anguished father, gazing at a list of expensive school supplies, answers: ""Me neither, my son."" 
In a third drawing, a Venezuelan is seen running toward an alien spaceship, begging for help. 
The creator of these evocative political cartoons is Gabriel Moncada, a 13 year-old Venezuelan schoolboy. 
The mature, bespectacled teen always enjoyed drawing animals and cars, but a few years ago began sketching the despair of his compatriots in the face of hyperinflation, mass emigration and shortages of food and medicine.
""Kids start to realize (what is happening), because they do not go to the movies as much, they realize they cannot stay in the street late, there is not as much food in the house or the same products,"" said Moncada, sitting at the desk where he sketches. 
""The drawings are a way to express myself. I think it is a creative, fun, and different way of showing the problems we experience daily,"" he said. 
His mother, 46-year old radio journalist Cecilia Gonzalez, started to publish her son's cartoons on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in late 2016. An impressed friend quickly asked to publish them on her online news site, TeLoCuentoNews, where every Friday for nearly two years they have appeared in a section called ""This is how Gabo sees it,"" referring to Moncada's nickname. 
Venezuela's economic meltdown has forced almost 2 million people to flee since 2015, according to the United Nations migration and refugees agencies. President Nicolas Maduro disputes that tally, saying they have been exaggerated by political adversaries, and that those who have left are seeking to return.
Moncada's mother said the family initially tried to shield him from the reality of the country's decay, but gave up as the problems became increasingly evident.
""Nothing is like it used to be, and they realize that,"" said Gonzalez. ""You bring your kids to school and there are three or four children eating out of the garbage on the corner."" 
The increasingly common sight of people eating from the trash emerged in one of Moncada's sketches, which shows two rats standing below a pile of garbage as human hands dig through it. 

One rat asks ""Where's the food?"" The other responds ""They have taken it from us.""

HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf is expected to sign legislation on Friday raising the maximum penalty for fraternity hazing to a felony, carrying up to seven years in prison.
Named the “Timothy Piazza Anti-Hazing Law” after a Penn State freshman who died during hazing activities at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house in February 2017, the bill unanimously passed the Legislature.
“It’s a really big deal, a real change in landscape,” said Tom Kline, a Philadelphia lawyer who has represented the Piazza family since their son’s death. “It’s about deterrence, and changing Greek life.” The family declined to comment through their lawyer.
The law also allows the seizing of fraternity houses involved in hazing incidents, a provision that could make the Pennsylvania law tougher than Florida’s, which also provides for felony charges, said Tracy Maxwell, founder of Hazing Prevention, a national group. 
Florida's statute was previously considered the toughest of the existing 44 state anti-hazing laws. 
“It doesn’t matter how tough the law is if local prosecutors don’t have the stomach to enforce it,” Maxwell said.
Timothy Piazza of Lebanon, New Jersey, died of head and spleen injuries suffered while drunkenly falling multiple times, including twice down a flight of stairs, during hazing activities at the fraternity house. He was 19 years old. Much of it was captured on video.
Authorities have said that the fraternity brothers waited for hours before calling for medical help. The new law would create a ""safe haven"" that would exempt fraternity members from prosecution if they call police or emergency responders.
Stacy Parks Miller, the former Centre County prosecutor who tried but failed to get jail time for some of the Beta Theta Pi members, said she was concerned that the new law had been hastily written and may cause problems for prosecutors.
“While I am very pleased to see a new felony for cases like Tim's, I am concerned there is now less leverage for prosecutions for the more commonplace hazing cases,” Miller told Reuters. The new law requires prosecutors to prove that force or coercion was used to make victims participate in the hazing.
At least two other hazing-related deaths have occurred in Pennsylvania in the past five years.
Chen “Michael” Deng died in 2013 when he was 19 from injuries received during a hazing ritual by the Baruch College chapter of Pi Delta Psi at a house in the Poconos. Four fraternity members received two-year prison terms and more than 30 others received probation.
Marquise Braham, a student at Penn State’s Altoona campus, committed suicide in 2014 at the age of 18 after allegedly suffering a mental breakdown because of hazing by the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. 

“I think it’s a strong law,” said Rich Braham, an ABC News producer who is Marquise’s father. “It’s a much better law than existing law and will save student lives.""

Severin Krasimirov, 21, is charged with rape and murder with extreme cruelty in the case of Marinova and on Friday he was remanded in custody.
Bulgarian National Radio reported that he spoke to reporters as he was brought to a district court in the northern city of Ruse on the Danube.
""I do not know what happened. I cannot remember everything. I went there and I slapped her, she fell. I want to move on but she grabbed me,"" Krasimirov told reporters in the hallway of the court building.
""Yes, I am guilty, I am very sorry. I cannot believe that I have done that,"" Krasimirov said in a wavering voice, when reporters asked whether he plans to tell the court he is guilty.
A prosecutor later told Reuters he was not asked to plead at the hearing. If convicted he faces life without parole.
Marinova, 30, hosted a current affairs show at a regional television channel in Ruse. Her body was found in a park on the Danube on Oct. 6. Police said she was beaten, raped and died of suffocation.
Prosecutors say there was no evidence her death was related to her work and pointed to a random sexual crime, though they said they are investigating all possibilities.
Investigators say DNA found on the victim matches Krasimirov. They have also collected additional evidence against him, Interior Minister Mladen Marinov said on Friday.

Krasimirov was extradited from Germany on Wednesday. He has told a German court he hit a woman he did not know but did not intend to kill her. German officials have said that based on his statement there was no political motive for the murder.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two soccer players arrested over violent attacks in Moscow are not the first rich and famous Russians to get into trouble after mixing alcohol and strippers. 
But their harsh treatment and public shaming after an outcry over the attacks is highly unusual and some critics of the Kremlin say it is using the case of Alexander Kokorin and Pavel Mamayev to deflect attention from bigger problems.
With the glow of President Vladimir Putin's March re-election win gone, his ratings hit by an unpopular pension reform and the buzz of hosting the soccer World Cup over, the Kremlin has the difficult task of trying to distract and appease what polls show is an increasingly disgruntled populace.
Kokorin and Mamayev, who both play in Russia's top league, will be held in custody for two months over the attacks and both could face lengthy jail terms.
CCTV footage circulated by Russian police shows a man being kicked and punched by a group of people and another incident in which two civil servants appear to be assaulted in a cafe. 
The two players were present at both incidents after celebrating a decade of friendship in a Moscow strip club where they said they had been drinking beer. 
Mamayev has admitted committing assault, but denied the more serious charge of hooliganism. ""As regards the assault I apologize and ask the forgiveness of the victims,"" Mamayev told a judge on Friday.
Kokorin has also apologized. His lawyer has not challenged the assault charge but is contesting the more serious charge of hooliganism. 
""I repent,"" Kokorin told a court on Oct. 11. ""My behavior was unacceptable and I will do everything to deserve forgiveness."" 
The story overshadowed embarrassing Western accusations about failed Russian spies for several days.
""The footballer hooligans carried out a priceless public relations service for the Kremlin,"" wrote Alexander Plushev, a presenter on the Ekho Moskvy radio station, which gives air time to speakers who are critical of the authorities.
""It's like the protagonists of this scandal have been chosen by a great director: famous footballers, but not from the Russian team side that we liked so much at the recent World Cup. Arrogant guys who are not poor -- the ideal target for the man in the street's displeasure.""
An opinion poll conducted by state pollster VTsIOM showed that 86 percent of Russians had heard of the scandal, and that 55 percent of those who knew about it considered the two players guilty, and that only 6 percent of those asked thought they should not be punished.
The case has given people the illusion that their opinion counts, Ekho Moskvy's Plushev wrote in a column, saying people had been given the impression they could decide the men's fate.
Dmitry Bykov, a prominent writer, said the Russian public had enjoyed the show. 
""The people are rejoicing,"" he wrote in Snob magazine. ""They're rejoicing in the same way they do when there's a battle against privileges when their own life is not improving one iota but when some really public figure is being publicly brought low and trampled upon.""
When asked if it had orchestrated a media campaign around the case and whether the scandal had proved a useful distraction from other more serious problems such as Kremlin candidates losing regional elections, the Kremlin did not respond. 
GLASS CAGES
Kokorin, 27, and Mamayev, 30, earn millions of dollars a year in a country where the average wage is $8,000 per annum.
Zenit St Petersburg, where Kokorin plays as a forward, has said it is considering how to punish him. Mamayev's club, Krasnodar, has said it is exploring how to end his contract.
Police ordered the players to turn themselves in or be put on the country's wanted list. 
State television broadcast footage of them being questioned, investigators opened a criminal case and a court jailed the pair for two months pending trial. The players were shown sitting in glass cages reserved for defendants in Russian court rooms. 
If found guilty of charges of hooliganism and assault, they face up to seven years in jail.
Three days after the incident, Putin signed a decree giving the two civil servants attacked in the cafe top state awards. One of the men, a senior civil servant with Asian roots, has accused the players of racially abusing him. 
Lawyers unaffiliated to the men say their treatment has been unusually harsh and unlike other cases of alleged wrongdoing by prominent members of society who critics say largely enjoy impunity. 
When the head of parliament's international affairs committee was accused of sexual harassment this year, an allegation he denied, the Kremlin questioned the integrity of his female accusers and parliament cleared him.
More serious cases, including when the defense minister's son ran over and killed a woman on a pedestrian crossing in Moscow in 2005, have also been swiftly closed.
The Kremlin often declines to comment on such cases but has condemned the players' behavior.
""We've seen the pretty unpleasant video footage,"" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, said of the players' case. ""There were obviously a lot of witnesses and it was captured on video. Law enforcement authorities will have no trouble getting to the bottom of what happened."" 
Asked by Reuters whether the Kremlin had told state media and the police how to handle the case, he did not respond.
""They need to be made an example of and locked up,"" Vladimir Solovyov, a high-profile journalist, said of the case. He called for a five-year jail sentence. 

""There won't be any girls, champagne or hookah pipes in prison,"" he said.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>",Russian spying increasing: Swiss intelligence chief,"By John Revill and Cecile Mantovani
BERN (Reuters) - Russian spying in Switzerland is increasing, the Swiss intelligence agency said on Friday after two high-profile cases involving suspected Russian agents trying to infiltrate sites in Switzerland. 
""I cannot give a lot of details about the Russian activities in Switzerland but it is clear we have more activities than before,"" Jean-Philippe Gaudin, director of the NDB intelligence service, told Reuters. ""I cannot say how many spies, but it is significant.""
Swiss authorities believe two Russian spies targeted a Swiss chemical weapons testing facility and prosecutors are also investigating a cyber attack against the offices of the World Anti-Doping Agency in Switzerland. 
Gaudin said Switzerland was being targeted because it hosts many international organizations and NGOs, particularly around Geneva. Sporting organizations like the International Olympic Committee could also be targeted.
He said spying did not just involve Russians, but also agents from other countries.
""What is different today is the Russians tried to act against our sensitive infrastructure, that is a red line,"" he said.
The NDB said in September it had worked with British and Dutch counterparts to foil a Russian plot which, according to newspaper reports, was targeting a Swiss laboratory testing nerve agents such as Novichok. Britain says Moscow used Novichok to try to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March and has charged two Russian men in absentia with attempted murder. 
The Russian embassy in Bern has dismissed the Swiss account as ""absurd.""

817,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","With presidency in sight, Bolsonaro stumbles with campaign finance allegation","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Earlier this week, Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro said the presidency was ""within reach."" Just a day later though, Bolsonaro had to deny he had indulged in the same skullduggery he has often accused his leftist opponents of masterminding. 
Despite increasing his lead in an opinion poll over leftist Workers Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad on Thursday, Bolsonaro was forced to deny accusations by Haddad that he had asked business leaders at a dinner in Sao Paulo for funds to pay for bulk propaganda messaging on WhatsApp, which would be a campaign finance violation.
The PT filed an official complaint with the election tribunal asking it to investigate, injecting a dose of uncertainty into an election race that has looked increasingly one-sided in recent weeks.
Bolsonaro has ridden a wave of anger over years of graft, and rising violence, accusing the PT, which ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years, of destroying Brazil and killing its economy.
The anti-establishment candidate, who has represented Rio de Janeiro state as a federal congressman for nearly three decades, has won supporters thanks to a career untainted by corruption accusations. 
Nonetheless, his top economic adviser is being investigated by federal prosecutors over accusations of fraud tied to the pension funds of state-run companies, underlining the scale of the rot in Brazil's political landscape.
The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported on Thursday that well-heeled Bolsonaro supporters had paid for messaging by third-party agencies, with each spending up to 12 million reais ($3.26 million) to spread tens of thousands of attack ads.
The report energized Haddad, who said his party has witnesses saying Bolsonaro asked business leaders for cash to pay for the bulk messaging, which he described as undeclared campaign contributions. A representative for WhatsApp, which is owned by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), said the report was being taken seriously.
Campaign propaganda has flooded social media in Brazil ahead of an Oct. 28 run-off vote in the presidential election. The issue of fake news and abuse of social media has been a growing concern in elections across the world, and tech companies have come under growing pressure to limit misinformation. 

It was unclear what effect, if any, the accusations would have on opinion polls. A Datafolha survey, taken before the campaign finance allegation was made public, showed Bolsonaro had 59 percent of voter support, compared to 41 percent for Haddad. Bolsonaro had 58 percent versus 42 percent for Haddad last week.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's move to legalize recreational marijuana this week is unlikely to immediately trigger a flood of pot-fueled tourism, as tour operators and consumers are unsure about rules governing the brand new industry.
There are precedents for Canada to follow in California, Colorado and elsewhere. But observers noted that these U.S. states offering legal recreational marijuana could put a damper on Canada's own pot travel aspirations: Why go all the way to Canada when you can smoke legally a couple of states away?
On Wednesday, Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize recreational marijuana, sparking huge demand. But those in the tourism industry are meeting legalization with more precaution than promotion.
""The tourist is really at the mercy of the drastically changing landscape,"" said Neev Tapiero, who had a soft launch for his company, Canadian Kush Tours, months ago. ""There's still other bugs to work out.""
The landscape changed on Wednesday with legalization. It will change again in six months when Ontario, Canada's most populous province, allows for private storefronts, and again months after that if edible pot products become legal, he said. 
Tapiero said he wishes government tourism agencies were more proactive in telling potential tourists what is and isn't legal.
Denelle Balfour, a spokeswoman for Ontario's Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, said a general public awareness campaign directs people to an information site.
""We've only had a couple of calls"" from would-be tourists asking about legal weed, said Gordon Orr, Chief Executive Officer of Tourism Windsor Essex. ""One was, 'Where do we get it?'""
Some tour operators are hesitant to highlight the fledgling industry.
""We don't use it as a promotion tool,"" said Christian Wolters, Tour Radar's managing director of North America. ""If someone specifically is asking questions we indicate it is legal ... but they have to be careful whenever they go back to their own country."" 
Aaron Bowker, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, had a tough message for the would-be visitors.
""I've been telling people for months now: If you do travel to Canada to recreationally use marijuana and you are a U.S. citizen, you are guaranteed entry to the United States. However ... do not bring it back."" 
On Wednesday, new posters went up at bus terminals across Canada targeted at a specific demographic: cannabis aficionados.
Bus tour operator Greyhound's sign tells passengers where to pack the drug, where they can smoke it and, importantly, what to do with it if they're crossing the border: Leave it behind.
But don't expect American tourists to be too pot-savvy when they cross the border in search of Canada's legal cannabis, said Ryan McConnell, senior vice-president of Kantar Consulting, a firm that recently researched America's ""cannabis-curious.""
""You're going to find some people thinking it's a free-for-all, everything's legal. That's just not the case.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will seriously consider the possibility of an unprecedented visit to North Korea but some conditions will have to be met, a senior Vatican official said.
Such a trip would be a landmark in a nation known for severe restrictions on religious practice. It would be the first by a pope to the reclusive East Asian state, which does not allow priests to be permanently stationed there.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed a verbal invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the pope during a 35-minute meeting in the Vatican on Thursday. 
""The pope expressed his willingness. We have to wait for it (the invitation) to be formalized,"" Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See's second-ranking official, told reporters on Thursday evening.
Asked if there were conditions that the North would have to meet, Parolin, speaking on the sidelines of a book presentation, said: ""This will come later, once we start thinking in earnest about the possibility of making this trip, then we will have to think about conditions in which the trip can take place.
""(The pope) is willing to make the trip but a trip of this kind will need serious preparation,"" added Parolin, who met separately with Moon after the South Korean president held talks with the pope.
North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as long as it does not undermine the state. But beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship - including a Catholic church in the capital Pyongyang - no open religious activity is allowed and the authorities have repeatedly jailed foreign missionaries.
There is little information on how many of North Korea's citizens are Catholic, or how they practice their faith. 
Kim told Moon, a Catholic, of his wish to meet the pontiff during a meeting last month and the South Korean leader announced before his trip to the Vatican that he would be relaying a message..
The pope, who is due to visit nearby Japan next year, told Moon he would ""definitely answer"" an invitation from Kim if it arrives, according to Moon's office.
A meeting with Pope Francis would be the latest in a string of major diplomatic encounters for Kim this year.

The two Koreas have held three summits this year. Kim also held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, where the leaders promised to work toward decentralization of the Korean peninsula.

Kenya enjoyed its most successful Olympics ever in Rio, winning six gold medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field. But the on-field achievements were blighted by allegations of corruption among Kenyan team leaders and senior government officials.
An investigation laid the blame on Wario, the sports minister at the time, and six other former senior officials, according to the East African country's chief prosecutor, Noordin Haji.
Wario, who became Kenya's ambassador to Austria earlier this year, was charged with six counts of abuse of office. He and two of his co-accused denied the charges before a Nairobi magistrate and were then freed on bail of 1 million shillings ($9,915.72) each. The trial will be held next month.
Prosecutors have said they also expect to charge Kipchoge Keino, a renowned former athlete who bagged golds for Kenya at the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968 and Munich in 1972. 
Keino was the chairman of the National Olympic Committee during the Rio Games when more than 55 million shillings were misappropriated. He was not in court on Friday and prosecutors said they were investigating his role further.
Dozens of senior government officials and business people are facing various charges related to corruption, part of a fresh attempt by President Uhuru Kenyatta since May to crack down on widespread graft.

Critics accused Kenyatta of failing to deal with corruption during his first term which ended last year, despite promises to do so when he was first elected in 2013.

He has denied any wrongdoing and the Russian Foreign Ministry has demanded that Norway drop ""the absurd charges"" and release Bochkaryov, whom it identified as a member of staff in the Russian parliament's upper house.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>",Italy's Salvini returns to Rome to tackle coalition row,"By Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he will halt an election tour in the north of Italy and return to Rome to settle a row within the government over a tax amnesty as financial markets sold off Italian assets.
""Today I'm in Trentino but tomorrow I'll fly to Rome to solve the problems. No more arguing,"" Salvini, who is also leader of the ruling League party that governs with the 5-Star Movement, said in a statement.
On Wednesday, Luigi Di Maio, head of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said the text of the amnesty had been ""manipulated"" after his party had signed off on the measure in cabinet, raising doubts about the stability of the coalition government that took office in June.
While 5-Star has opposed amnesties in the past, the right-wing League, with its traditional voter-base of self-employed businessmen, is more favorable.
The cabinet this week signed off on an expansionary 2019 budget, boosting welfare spending, cutting the retirement age and hiking the deficit to set up a showdown with authorities in Brussels over compliance with EU rules.
Key policies for next year will be funded by the tax amnesty, which includes several schemes to allow people to settle disputes with the authorities by paying a limited sum. The amnesties are targeted to raise about 8 billion euros.
The main scheme involved people who have failed to declare up to 100,000 euros of earnings during the last five years, on which they will be able to pay a rate of 20 percent.
The spat broke out because it emerged that in the final draft to be sent to parliament the 100,000 euros referred to each of a series of taxes evaded, rather than to the overall total. 5-Star said this was unacceptable and it had been tricked.
The political turbulence comes on top of a dispute with the European Commission over the budget which is alarming markets.
The spread between yields on Italian benchmark government bonds and the German equivalent widened on Friday to a 5-and-a-half-year high of 337 basis points and Italian bank shares plunged.
In the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to Brussels rejecting the budget and to fines against Italy, the Commission sent Rome a warning letter on Thursday.
The document said the budget appeared to be in ""particularly serious non-compliance"" with EU rules and its deviation from targets was ""unprecedented"". It gave Rome until Oct. 22 to respond.
Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who handed the letter to Italy's Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, is due to hold a news conference in Rome on Friday at 1330 GMT.
Salvini played down the internal government rift in an interview with Il Messaggero daily on Friday, saying: ""There is absolutely no government crisis"".

But Giancarlo Giorgetti, a cabinet undersecretary and high-ranking League official warned 5-Star not to ""continue to see conspiracies at every turn.""

Mats Malm, a professor in literature at Gothenburg University, becomes the third new member appointed this month to the 18-member body, filling all empty seats including two left vacant by members who quit over the scandal. 
The Academy, founded by Sweden's king 232 years ago to safeguard the Swedish language, has picked the Nobel prizewinner in literature since 1901. Other Swedish bodies select winners in other fields and a Norwegian committee awards the peace prize.
The awarding of this year's literature prize was postponed in the wake of rape accusations against Swedish-French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural foundation that received Academy funds.
Arnault, who is married to one member of the Academy and has had personal and professional relationships with several others, was sentenced this month to two years in prison for rape. He has been accused of leaking names of literature prize winners, and the Academy is investigating his financial relationship with it.
He denies wrongdoing and is appealing the rape conviction.
In addition to the two members of the Academy who quit over the affair, four others, including Arnault's wife Katarina Frostenson, have suspended their participation.
The head of the Nobel Foundation, which grants the prizes but does not pick the winners, has said the Swedish Academy could lose its role in awarding the literature prize if it does not regain its legitimacy following the scandal.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Romania’s tug of war over rule of law nears the line,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - A power struggle between Romania's government and judiciary is reaching a tipping point that risks driving a new wedge between the European Union and its eastern members over democratic standards.
Justice Minister Tudorel Toader has said he will soon decide the future of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in an anti-corruption drive which has won praise from Brussels for exposing high-level graft, including the theft of EU funds.
Augustin Lazar oversees around 2,500 prosecutors, including anti-organized crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
If Toader decides to trigger Lazar's dismissal, it will mark the end of an era for Romania's prosecutors. The head of the DNA has already been fired and DIICOT leader's mandate has expired.
The government says the units have ruined innocent lives.
Anti-corruption prosecutors have secured almost 5,000 convictions over the past five years, including 27 lawmakers and 83 mayors across parties, as well as ministers, county council heads, state firm managers and magistrates. 
Among them is Liviu Dragnea, leader of the ruling Social Democrats, who was barred from becoming prime minister by a conviction in the first of three investigations against him. He denies all wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political witch-hunt by the judiciary.
In recent months, his party has launched a slew of bills to overhaul criminal law and procedures to raise the burden of proof. It has also set up a unit to investigate judges and prosecutors for possible crimes and aims to reorganize judges panels.
European diplomats, who are seeking sanctions against fellow east European states Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic values, are concerned Romania is following suit.
""MOVING BACKWARDS""
""There is now the real risk that things are moving backwards in a way that would be damaging not only for Romanian democracy but for the place that it has built as an EU member state,"" the EU executive's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said at a meeting of the European Parliament this month.
""The procedure that has been started recently in relation to the general prosecutor raises similarly worrying concerns.""
An EU advisory body for constitutional rights, the Venice Commission, will issue an opinion on Romania later on Friday. Its preliminary view said parts of the judicial overhaul ""are likely to undermine the independence of Romanian judges and prosecutors, and public confidence in the judiciary.""
Any punitive measures against Romania similar to those the EU is seeking for Hungary and Poland will depend on the outcome of the wider legal changes the Social Democrats have initiated.
On Monday, the government tightened hiring criteria for DNA and DIICOT prosecutors via an emergency decree; as a result, over 40 of those prosecutors will be reassigned to other work. It said this was to address the Venice Commission's concerns.
Dragnea and senior party members say they aim to curb abuses by prosecutors and secret services, invoking the specter of a ""parallel state"" that illegally wiretaps them.
DNA chief Laura Codruta Kovesi lost her job in July after an assessment by the justice minister similar to the one Lazar is undergoing now, despite resistance from the judicial watchdog and the president.
Other prosecutors and judges have had inspectors in their offices looking for flaws in their work.
""There is a tactic of making examples out of high profile legal professionals,"" one anti-corruption prosecutor told Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect pending cases. 
""They're trying to show what happens if you don't behave. And it is working. Some people in the judiciary are starting to think, why I am fighting this?""
Minister Toader triggered the evaluation of Lazar, who oversees the prosecution service, or public ministry, in late August, saying the decision did not come out of the blue.
""Over time, I have noticed how the public ministry has veered away from its constitutional role of guaranteeing citizens’ rights and liberties,"" he said. ""As before (with Kovesi), I will make a radiograph of the prosecutor general’s management and I will reach a conclusion.""
The minister told private television station Antena3 earlier this week his conclusion was days away.
Lazar, who was appointed three years ago and has accused the government of trying to politicize the judiciary, said prosecutors' work was transparent and he did not fear being dismissed.
""It is unfortunately a very sensitive time for the Romanian judiciary and rule of law,"" he told a conference after the minister's announcement, the only time he addressed the issue.
""It's a context in which manipulating public opinion is often used as an instrument to destabilize prosecutors' work.""
The prosecutor general is in charge of requests to lift the immunity of lawmakers for investigations and has a vote on the country's judicial watchdog.
Some critics have said he has not been aggressive enough in cleaning up the ranks of corrupt or inefficient colleagues, but many prosecutors admire him for standing up for them.
DNA statements show the bulk of its anti-corruption cases concern public works contracts given to firms which courts later found to be paying bribes; many were overpriced and some payments, including with EU funds, were made for fictitious works.
Timmermans said any changes that would weaken oversight of how EU taxpayers' money was spent in Romania ""will trigger an immediate response from the Commission.""
Investors' associations have repeatedly warned that corruption is a strong deterrent for business.
Dragnea, who is also lower house speaker, was given a two-year suspended sentence in a vote rigging case and also sentenced to three and a half years in jail for helping keep two party employees on the payroll of the state child protection agency. He has appealed and is due in court on Nov 5.[L8N1TN5FJ]
He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded, charges he denies.
CHECKS AND BALANCES
Romania's centrist president was forced to sign the Social Democrats' overhaul of the judiciary into law this month after he used up his chances to object. It removes his veto rights on appointing top prosecutors, one of the key checks and balances.
Toader's nominee to replace Kovesi at the head of anti-corruption unit DNA has raised concerns she might be soft on high-level crime.
In August, riot police fired tear gas into the crowd at an anti-government rally and beat protesters holding their hands up.
An existing judicial inspectorate, whose chief Toader has kept on after his mandate expired, has been investigating magistrates at a rapid pace. Many of those probed have criticized the legislative changes.
U.S. ambassador Hans Klemm told law students this month the judicial overhaul ""creates greater opportunities to coerce and punish troublesome magistrates."" 
""Cloaked in the mantle of concern for due process and human rights, some of these changes are a clear attempt to protect vested interests from an independent judiciary,"" he said.
The ruling party does not always succeed. This month, the Constitutional Court struck down most of alterations to criminal procedures that were challenged and which would have raised the burden of proof on all criminal investigations.
The Court will discuss challenges brought against proposed changes to the criminal code on Oct. 24.
The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives aim to align legislation with EU norms and address abuses, citing acquittals by higher courts, although these are rare, and corruption investigations against some prosecutors.
Dragnea has also said that Romania's Secret Service (SRI), which has been gathering wiretap evidence for prosecutors based on court warrants, has been abusing its powers, faking evidence and illegally intercepting ""millions of Romanians.""
He said either parliament or government should pass a bill to retroactively cancel wiretap evidence. That would jeopardize hundreds of verdicts ranging from corruption to human trafficking and potentially Dragnea's cases as well.
DNA said that just over 36,000 people, not millions, have been wire-tapped since 2005.

""When the dust settles,"" the anti-corruption prosecutor said, ""it will take years to figure out how these laws were changed and what is left.""

YOKOSUKA, Japan (Reuters) - Unclaimed urns containing ashes of the dead are piling up by the thousands across Japan, creating storage headaches and reflecting fraying family ties and economic pressures in a rapidly aging nation.
The identities of the dead, cremated at public expense, are usually known. But in most cases, relatives either refuse or don't respond to requests to collect their remains. Burials can be costly and time-consuming, a burden on family members who may hardly know the deceased relative.
""When I die, though I have only 150,000 yen ($1,340), will you cremate me and put me in a pauper's grave? I have no one to collect my remains,"" said a note left by a man in his 70s in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, who died in 2015 and whose urn was later buried at a local temple.
The abandoned remains highlight social, economic and demographic changes in Japan, where more elderly live on welfare and families are more scattered, weakening traditional family bonds and obligations.
It is a problem that is likely to grow, experts say; deaths in Japan are projected to rise from 1.33 million a year to 1.67 million by 2040, even as the overall population drops.
Yokosuka was so overwhelmed with unclaimed urns that it ran out of space in a 300-year-old charnel house that was about to collapse. It combined ashes of different people into a much smaller number of urns that it now stores in a hillside cave, with about 50 newer urns accumulating at the city office. 
""Space to store them is running out,"" said Hitomi Nakamura, an official in Saitama city, north of Tokyo, where the number of unclaimed urns has grown sharply the last few years to more than 1,700. 
""Many elderly people are living on welfare,"" he added, ""and many of them may be estranged from their families.""
With Japanese wages barely growing, and many children of the elderly living on pensions themselves, managing death costs, including arranging for their burial, can be a burden. 
A traditional funeral, including food, drinks and gifts for guests, and hiring a Buddhist monk to chant sutras, can cost 2 million yen ($17,800) or more, industry sources say. 
New businesses have sprung up offering no-frills funerals for $2,000 to $4,000, but other costs can add up, including the hundreds of dollars it may cost to bury the urn at a temple or cemetery.
POOR ELDERLY
There are more elderly poor than in years past, some of whom cannot afford their own funerals. Nearly 3 percent of elderly were on welfare in 2015, almost double the rate two decades earlier, government statistics show. Just over half of all Japanese on welfare are 65 or older.
""There are more people who die alone, with no one to look after cremated remains because of weaker family relationships,"" said Hisako Makimura, a visiting professor of sociology at Kansai University.
In decades past, it was not uncommon for three generations of family to live together. But experts say that as Japan's economy has changed, couples have fewer children, and people tend to move farther from home for work, among other factors.
Nearly 6,000 urns have accumulated in the southern city of Fukuoka, while Osaka, in western Japan, buried the remains of 2,366 people in a communal grave this year after no one claimed them after one or two years. 
The number of Japanese age 65 and older will swell from 28 percent of the population to 36 percent by 2040, according to the government-backed National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.
""Families and communities used to play roles of taking care of deceased people,"" Makimura said. ""But the burden on local governments will likely grow as their involvement in dealing with the dead increases.""
(Click for graphic on Japan's aging population: http://tmsnrt.rs/2HKy1i7)
'SO RELIEVED'
In Yokosuka, more elderly are dying without leaving funeral instructions or information about relatives. 
City officials comb through their homes and census registries, and try to contact family members through the mail, often to no avail.
""The dead are ordinary citizens. It could happen to anyone,"" said Kazuyuki Kitami, a city official. ""These bones are warning those of us who are alive that we are poorly prepared.""
Noticing that many unclaimed remains were from poor elderly people, Yokosuka in 2015 started an ""ending plan support"" service for low-income residents with no immediate family members.
Individuals pay at least a fifth of the 250,000 yen cremation and burial costs, with the government covering the rest. Dozens have signed up, and in May the city made similar services available to anyone.
""I feel so relieved,"" said Sumitaka Haraguchi, 80, after signing up for the service and ensuring he will be buried at a local temple. 
Haraguchi never married and hasn't seen his three step-siblings in many years, so he worried what would happen to his remains when he died.
""My days have changed,"" he said from his nursing home. ""I feel calm.""

832,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>","Malaysian ex-deputy PM charged with money laundering, graft","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, was charged on Friday with 45 criminal offences including money laundering and graft, the state news agency reported, amid a widening crackdown on corruption. 
Ahmad Zahid leads the opposition as president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the once-powerful party that ruled Malaysia for 60 years before being ousted in a shock general election defeat in May. 
He is the latest former high-ranking official to be charged for suspected graft, as authorities ramp up investigations into how billions of dollars allegedly went missing from state coffers. 
Ahmad Zahid was brought to a Kuala Lumpur court and charged with 10 counts of criminal breach of trust and eight counts of abuse of power involving sums totaling 42 million ringgit ($10 million), the Bernama news agency reported. 
He was also charged with 27 counts of laundering about 72 million ringgit ($17.3 million).
Each charge carries lengthy jail terms of up to 20 years, with fines of up to five times the value of the illegal transactions, for the money laundering and abuse of power offences.
He pleaded not guilty to all charges, Bernama said. 
Ahmad Zahid, also a former home minister, was accused of using his position to receive bribes in exchange for helping companies win contracts for ministry projects, the news agency reported.
In one case, he was alleged to have accepted 6 million ringgit ($1.4 million) from an official of a company that had secured a five-year government contract to supply 12.5 million electronic chips for Malaysian passports.
He was also accused of misusing funds from his family-run charity foundation, Bernama said.
Ahmad Zahid had earlier denied allegations of using the foundation's funds to settle credit card debts for himself and his wife, saying the payments had been made in error by an aide. 
The charges against Ahmad Zahid are not related to a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) that led to the former ruling coalition's shock election defeat in May.
U.S. authorities say more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, and nearly $700 million from the fund was diverted into the personal bank accounts of ex-premier Najib Razak. 

Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, face multiple money laundering and corruption charges linked to 1MDB. They have pleaded not guilty, with Najib's trial slated to begin next year.

Three dozen priests staged a sit-in against the Supreme Court decision which overturned a ban that prevented women of between the age of 10 and 50 entering the Sabarimala temple, which pays homage to the celibate God Ayyappan, in the southwest state of Kerala.
Some Hindu communities consider menstruating women unclean.
""They have decided to go back provided we give them protection,"" Kerala's Inspector General, S. Sreejith, told reporters of the two women, adding the head priest threatened to close the temple if they entered.
Television channels showed topless men sitting in protest at the temple entrance, clapping and shouting religious chants, even as hundreds of police tried to calm tensions.
Hindu hardliners including youth members of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have been involved in violent clashes with police in Kerala and have attacked women including journalists who have tried to get to the temple this week.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>","In China's Catholic heartland, Vatican deal brings Communist Party closer","By Christian Shepherd
DONGLU VILLAGE, China (Reuters) - In 1996, a tiny village with a huge Gothic-style church in China's Catholic heartland of northern Hebei province was the scene of a tense stand-off between the ruling Communist Party and the faithful.
Authorities surrounded Donglu village's Our Lady of China Catholic Church, blocking thousands of pilgrims and detaining Vatican-ordained Bishop Su Zhimin, who was a member of the ""underground"" Church, not the state-backed official Church which did not recognize the pope's authority to name bishops.
Despite repeated appeals to Chinese authorities from Vatican officials and underground clergy, it is unclear whether Su, who would now be 86, is still being held or is even alive.
Decades on, the Donglu church's ties with officials are now convivial, according to Diao Ligang, a local priest, reflecting a generational shift toward acceptance of the ruling Communist Party's authority over China's Catholics. 
""Before, it was as if they kept wanting to see what we were hiding in our fist,"" said Diao. ""But then we opened it and they realized there was nothing dangerous in there in the first place.""
Last month's secretive deal with the Vatican, which gives the Holy See a long-sought and decisive say over the appointment of new bishops, sets the stage for Beijing to recognize some underground congregations. Details of how and when this process might happen have not been released. 
Interviews with five underground priests and two dozen believers in Hebei suggest previously stark divisions between underground Catholics loyal to the Vatican and churches officially registered with the Chinese authorities have blurred in recent years.
The coming together reflects growing, if grudging, acceptance of government oversight by the faithful, as the Vatican pushes for a reconciliation with Beijing and many of the older generation that had expressed staunch opposition to the party are either silenced or dead.
Still, Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former archbishop of Hong Kong, has led an international chorus of conservative critics who say the deal is a sellout to the Communist Party and an insult to those who had suffered under oppression.   
    He and other opponents of the secretive deal warn the expected gradual folding of unofficial churches into a government system of control risks abandoning a group of ""loyalist"" bishops and priests, who for decades resisted joining the Catholic Patriotic Association, as the state-backed church is known, and have been punished as a result.
BLURRED LINES
China says there are six million Catholics in the country, across 98 officially approved dioceses. The Holy Spirit Study Centre, run by the diocese of Hong Kong, estimates that there are 10 million believers spread over 144 dioceses.
Such discrepancies have been the subject of closed-door negotiations for more than a decade between Beijing and the Vatican, which wants to preserve and expand the Catholic community in China.
The Vatican went ahead with the provisional deal, despite it failing to address some outstanding points of contention, because it feared the two Churches would split even further apart, resulting in a schism that would become irreparable, Vatican sources told Reuters
At four recent services attended by Reuters journalists, three official and one at an “underground” church, there was little that was discernibly different between those at churches loyal to Beijing or the Vatican.
Donglu is now run under the leadership of Bishop An Shuxin, who had been an ""underground"" coadjutor bishop alongside Su, meaning he had been granted right of succession by the Vatican. 
An was also detained in the 1996 crackdown but reappeared a decade later, and in 2009 announced he had joined the Patriotic Association. In 2010, he became the officially recognized bishop of Baoding diocese, where Donglu is located. 
An declined to be interviewed when contacted by Reuters, citing health problems.
    For Diao, the village priest, An's experience and that of the local Church in Donglu represents hope for an end to the divisions that have riven the church in China since Beijing in 1951 cut ties with the Vatican and banished its diplomatic mission. 
""These divisions are made by people who want to say they have more faith than others,"" Diao told Reuters during an interview in Donglu church, built in 1992 to replace the original shrine destroyed by Japanese bombers during World War Two. 
""If people have faith, then they have faith. That doesn't mean they shouldn't also follow the law.""
The church remains one of China's most important Catholic pilgrimage sites and thousands travel there every May to celebrate a claimed miraculous appearance of the Vigin Mary in 1900.
A depiction of Our Lady of China and the Baby Jesus, a painted image of a Chinese woman holding a baby, both dressed in the yellow imperial robes of the Qing dynasty, which ruled China until 1912, hangs in the church.
Since 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a tightening of restrictions on religious belief in China, with Muslims and Christians being targeted most.
Regular weekend classes and week-long summer camps for children at one church had been canceled by the authorities over the summer, one underground priest from a village near Hebei's Zhangjiakou city said, declining to be named for fear of retribution from the authorities.
In light of the Vatican deal, he preached patience and acceptance of government restrictions: ""I told my parishioners, this is not about the millions of us who already believe; it is about those who do not yet believe. We must have the foresight to think about how to let them find faith.""
FRAGILE ACCORD
The deal between Beijing and the Vatican was struck without resolution of some long-held Church concerns over clerics in detention, Catholic Church sources familiar with the substance of the deal have told Reuters.
As part of the deal, the Vatican approved seven excommunicated Patriotic Association bishops ordained without church approval, meaning all Beijing-approved Bishops have now been accepted by the Holy See. 
It is unclear what, if any, immediate change the deal made for Beijing's attitude toward China's approximately 30 underground bishops, whose uncertain fate could still scupper the accord, said Yang Fenggang, a professor at Purdue University in the United States specializing in religion in China. 
""This is a baby step and the relationship looks very fragile,"" he said.
However, the acceptance of government-backed bishops by the Holy See had already started to blur the lines, as more bishops were seen as both Vatican and Beijing-approved, he added. 
Wang Meixiu, an expert on China-Vatican relations at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said for the agreement to move forward the pope will have to call for unofficial churches to ""abandon former hatred"" and be good citizens.

""The eyes of the government are still on those churches that have not registered and those underground clerics that have not been approved,"" she said.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2018 02:02AM ET</span>",Southeast Asia hails world's first multilateral air encounter code,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian countries agreed on Friday to guidelines to manage unexpected encounters between their military aircraft, with host Singapore calling the pact a world first and saying they would encourage their international partners to join.
The agreement, signed by defense ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a conference in Singapore, includes a region-wide pact on the exchange of information on terrorism threats.
The voluntary, non-binding guidelines on air encounters build on an existing code to manage sea encounters adopted last year by ASEAN and its ""plus"" partners - Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and the United States.
""I am happy to announce the first multilateral guidelines for air encounters between military aircraft have been adopted,"" Singapore's defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, told a news conference.
""This is a significant achievement.""
The ASEAN ministers will meet their eight international partners on Saturday and Ng said they would ""seek their agreement"" on the guidelines.
The framework for the guidelines said a pact was needed because Asia's rising growth and prosperity had spurred an increase of maritime and air traffic in the region.
The United States and China in 2015 signed a pact on a military hotline and rules governing air-to-air encounters.
But even with the existing guidelines, tensions remain, especially in the hotly contested South China Sea.
China claims almost all of the busy waterway while Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory.
Taiwan also claims the sea.
This month, China expressed anger after a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands it claims, saying it resolutely opposed an operation that it called a threat to its sovereignty. 
Asked if the sea guidelines were working, Ng said, ""In a way they are like seatbelts, not completely protected, but at least they provide some protection.""
At a lunch meeting with his ASEAN counterparts, 
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States wanted a ""constructive relationship"" with China but remained concerned by what it saw as the militarization of the South China Sea.
In August, Southeast Asian nations and China adopted a negotiating framework for a broader code of conduct in the South China Sea.
That framework seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which has mostly been ignored by claimant states, particularly China, which has built seven islands in disputed waters, three of them equipped with runways, surface-to-air missiles and radars.
The ASEAN states also agreed to adopt the ""our eyes"" initiative as a platform to exchange information on ""terrorism, radicalism, and violent extremism, and other non-traditional threats"". 

They also agreed to set up a ""virtual"" network of chemical, biological and radiological defense experts to ""better share best practices and make quick contact during crises"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan joined in a group hug at a ""Fluro Friday"" event on Australia's Bondi Beach organized by surfers to raise awareness of mental health issues.
Harry, who has said he sought counseling in his late twenties to deal with the grief of losing his mother Diana, served in British Army and campaigns to provide mental health help for soldiers who need it. 
Harry, wearing khaki trousers and blue shirt, with Meghan in an ankle-length striped dress, kicked off their shoes to sit with members of community group OneWave, which tackles mental health issues using ""saltwater therapy, surfing and fluro"".
Fluro, short for fluorescent, refers to the brightly-colored shirts and flower garlands that members of the surfing group wear.
After listening to speakers in the circle for a few minutes, Harry, wearing a garland of blue flowers around his neck, and Meghan, one of pink, joined in the group hug.
""Harry said each and everyone of us will experience poor mental health at some stage in our lives,"" Charlotte Connell, who was in the circle, told the Australian Associated Press.
The couple occasionally clasped hands during the circle event, and later posed with a surfboard. 
Harry served in the British Army for 10 years, including two stints in Afghanistan, and now works with several charities, including supporting wounded soldiers. Along with his brother Prince William and his wife Catherine, Harry also set up a mental health charity.
Prince Harry and Meghan are on their first international tour since marrying in May. It will also take them to New Zealand and the South Pacific islands of Fiji and Tonga. 
After the event, the couple strolled along Bondi Beach, shaking hands and posing for photographs with some of the thousands of people who turned out for the royals, snapping pictures and video with their smartphones. 
Crowds have thronged for a glimpse of the couple, who are expecting their first child in the northern spring. The child will be seventh in line to the British throne.

The trip coincides with the Invictus Games to be held in Sydney from Saturday until Oct. 27. The games, founded by Harry, are an international paralympic-style event for military personnel wounded in action.

Nicaragua has been roiled by unrest since demonstrations began against planned welfare cuts by Ortega's government in April, which then spiraled into a wider protest against him.
The crackdown on protesters has sparked widespread international condemnation. Ortega's supporters say the protests have been orchestrated by his opponents to remove the former Marxist guerrilla from power.
In a report presented on Thursday in Berlin, Amnesty International said that two men, aged 22 and 34, and a 16-year-old boy were shot and killed by police while fleeing a shootout on July 24.
The other three potential victims were a policeman who stood down and two youths killed when students of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua on July 13 barricaded themselves in a church in Managua, Amnesty International said.
Nicaragua's deputy attorney general, Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, dismissed the report as a political attack on the government.
""Amnesty International does not have the authority to issue any report"" about the crisis in Nicaragua, Jarquin Ortel told Reuters in his office in Managua.
Jarquin Ortel elaborated by saying that when Nicaraguan human rights activist Bianca Jagger visited the country with Amnesty International in May, she issued ""political opinions"" critical of Ortega.
Amnesty International also documented 12 cases of torture, and said pro-government armed groups used ""military-grade lethal weapons."" Jarquin Ortel replied by saying the groups are regulated by Nicaraguan law and that provided support on security matters.
Local human rights groups say more than 300 people have been killed in the protests. Ortega's government disputes those figures and says around 200 people have died.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said on Thursday that its latest findings indicated 325 people had been killed during the protests, including 21 police officers.

China has faced an outcry from human rights groups, foreign governments and United Nations rights experts over what they say are mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim ethnic Uighur minority in Xinjiang.
Beijing has denied accusations that it is systematically violating the rights of Xinjiang's Muslims, saying it is only cracking down on extremism and ""splittism"" in the region. 
The China Daily said the ""false picture"" of Xinjiang in the foreign media was ""aimed at smearing the Chinese government"".
""A double standard is put into service to serve this end - China, critics in the West say, only imagines it faces a terrorist threat, and it is just Western countries that face the real threat of violence born of extremism,"" it said.
China says Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists in an area where in recent years hundreds have been killed in unrest between Uighurs and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Responding to recent comments by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence that China is engaged in ""religious persecution"" in Xinjiang, the editorial said Muslims in the region were vulnerable to extremist overseas propaganda and needed education and vocational skills.
The U.N. human rights panel said in August that China is believed to be holding up to 1 million ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of ""internment camps"" in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.
Beijing has denied that such camps are for ""political education"" and says they are instead vocational training centers, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.

""The people of Xinjiang, who are of many ethnic groups, will definitely not allow a handful of bad apples to hijack the bright future of their common home,"" the editorial said.

In a Wednesday press conference, Venezuelan Communication Minister Jorge Rodriguez said Moreno was a ""liar"" and accused him of exaggerating in a speech at the United Nations the number of Venezuelan migrants arriving in Ecuador. 
Saying the comments were offensive, Ecuador expelled the Venezuelan ambassador and called its charge d'affaires at its embassy in Caracas back for consultations, its foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Venezuela later declared the charge d'affaires, Elizabeth Méndez, persona non grata and gave her 72 hours to leave the country in what its foreign ministry described as a ""reciprocal measure,"" according to a statement read on state television.
Ecuador's highest representative in Venezuela has been the charge. The ambassador position has been vacant for more than a year because of diplomatic disputes. 
As many as 1.9 million Venezuelans have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations, fleeing an economic crisis that has resulted in shortages of food, medicine and other basic goods. That flow has overwhelmed other countries in the region, including Ecuador.

Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has said no more than 600,000 Venezuelans left in the past two years, and state television gives daily coverage to a government program offering migrants free flights back to Venezuela.

“This incident is unacceptable and clearly they have to answer questions,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Thursday in a CNBC interview. Saudi leaders’ response to the international uproar “will have an impact on how we all interact,” said Solomon, who took over at New York-based Goldman on Oct. 1. The remarks were among the strongest to emerge from a senior Wall Street executive since the furor erupted earlier this month.

CNN also withdrew, while the Financial Times said it wouldn’t partner with the event while Khashoggi’s disappearance remains unexplained. Bloomberg has pulled out as a media partner.
Turkish officials allege Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who lived in self-imposed exile, was murdered in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul after entering the building on Oct. 2.
Goldman had initially stood by plans to send two of its senior executives as representatives at the conference even as other were pulling out. Sheila Patel, the bank’s head of international asset-management operations, and Dina Powell, the ex-Trump aide with close ties to the region, were scheduled to attend.

Since 2016, the Venezuelan government has distributed subsidized food, mostly imported from nearby countries, to help address Venezuela's severe shortages of basic goods.
Army officials and government-supported groups in Venezuela tasked with distributing food amid widespread shortages in the crisis-hit OPEC member have long been suspected of fraud with food distribution, often with the help of businesses and individuals based outside of the country. 
In April, the United States and Colombia showed new evidence of fraud in the program, saying part of the funds ended up in the hands of corrupt government officials. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has defended the program, saying it has allowed his administration to fight capitalism and an international boycott against him.
The companies and people involved in the sales from Mexico, whose full names were not revealed, have also agreed to stop shipping food or medicines to the Venezuelan government under the program, known as CLAP, the Mexican attorney general's office said.
""This group of Mexican and foreign companies and people have obtained funds by diverting them from their humanitarian purposes, buying food and speculating with them instead,"" Israel Lira, head of the Mexican office specialized in organized crime investigations, told reporters.
Lira said prosecutors found about 1.8 million food boxes in 1,300 shipping containers in Mexico sold by these companies, but allowed them to continue on to Venezuela as part of the agreement.
""We would run the risk of aggravating the food crisis in that country, products would be getting out-of-date or could be delivered that are not fit for human consumption,"" Lira said.
Many of the products shipped from Mexico under the program were considered low-quality by authorities, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, a Mexican deputy foreign minister.

Information about the case will be shared by Mexican officials with other countries, including Colombia, to avoid fraud or money laundering, de Alba told reporters on Thursday. .

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libyan tribesmen staged a demonstration at the eastern oil port of Hariga on Thursday in protest against the appointment of a government minister, a leading member of the tribe said.
It was not clear whether the action affected oil exports from the port, located in Tobruk near the Egyptian border.
A spokesman for port operator AGOCO, part of state oil firm NOC, declined to comment.
""We are at the port's gate. No car can enter or leave the port,"" a member of the powerful Obeidat tribe told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
He said tribesmen were protesting against a decision by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli to appoint Ali Essawi as economy minister. 
Hariga lies in eastern Libya, run by a rival administration.
Libyan prosecutors had in 2011 named Essawi as the main suspect in the killing of Abdel Fattah Younes, a former top rebel commander during the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Younes belongs to the Obeidat tribe.
A Libyan court in 2012 dropped the case against Essawi and other suspects. But he re-emerged in the spotlight when Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez appointed him as economy minister this month.
Khalifa Haftar, a top commander whose troops control the east, this week ordered a new investigation into the killing of Younes. His killing caused deep rifts in the rebel camp which later took over the oil-producing country.
Younes was for years part of Gaddafi's inner circle.
He defected at the start of the uprising in February 2011 and became the military chief of the rebellion, a move opposed by other rebels who had suffered under the old regime.
The circumstances of his killing remain murky, but it is known that he was slain in July 2011 after rebel leaders summoned him back from the front line to Benghazi, the eastern city and cradle of the uprising.
Separately, gunmen stole two company cars at a control station of Libya's giant El Sharara oilfield on Thursday, a field engineer said.
Output has not been affected, he added. The field typically produces around 300,000 barrels a day.
Station 186, about 40km away from the main part of the field deep in the southern desert, has been attacked by gunmen several times.
In July, two staff, one of them Romanian, were kidnapped there and have not been heard from since. Output dropped temporarily by around 160,000 barrels a day after the attack, leading to a shutdown of the station before later recovering to former levels. 
Tripoli-based NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol (MC:REP), Total, OMV and Equinor, formerly known as  Statoil  (OL:EQNR). 

Last week, NOC staff staged small protests at three fields demanding salary increases, better work conditions and security.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation into child sex abuse by priests in Pennsylvania, six Roman Catholic Church dioceses said on Thursday. 
The investigation is the first statewide probe by federal authorities of allegations of sex abuse and cover-up by the Catholic Church in the United States, according to groups representing abuse victims. 
The Church in Chile, Australia and Ireland is also reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors with surveys showing the scandal has eroded confidence in the Church and Pope. 
The Pennsylvania dioceses said they had received federal subpoenas following a state grand jury report that alleged over 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania had sexually abused children over 70 years. The Associated Press first reported the Justice Department investigation on Thursday.
The dioceses of Allentown, Erie, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Scranton said they were cooperating with the investigation but declined further comment.
The Justice Department and U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia declined to comment. 
An 884-page report made public in August by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro after a two-year investigation contained graphic examples of children being groomed and sexually abused by clergymen. Shapiro said at the time that it was largely based on documents from secret archives kept by the dioceses, including handwritten confessions by priests.
The report cited 301 priests, some of whom have died.
Tim Lennon, president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), said the investigation was long overdue. Four statewide grand juries in Pennsylvania since 2003 identified around 500 alleged sexual predators among acting or former Catholic clergy, he said.
""In what other institution could you have 500 criminals and not be prosecuted?"" asked Lennon, who said he was raped by a Catholic priest when he was a child. 
Lennon said SNAP had asked the federal government three times since 2002 for a nationwide investigation of 15,000 active or retired Catholic clergy accused of being sexual predators. 
""This is a first. Federal law enforcement has been awfully silent on the Catholic abuse problem, and it's about time,"" said Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a U.S.-based resource center that tracks cases of clerical abuse worldwide. 
She said the only other U.S. federal probe was of a bishop in Boston in the early 2000s.

In September, U.S. Catholic bishops said they would set up a hotline for accusations of sexual abuse against bishops and other church leaders, or allegations of cover ups by such people.

(Reuters) - A federal judge ordered the U.S. government on Thursday to begin processing asylum claims for dozens of migrant parents and children that had been separated at the southern border under the Trump Administration's zero tolerance immigration policy.
The order directs the government to begin the process of reviewing asylum claims for about 60 detained parents and children, even if their claims had previously been denied.
Civil rights attorneys argued in court papers that the government was violating a September settlement agreement that had cleared the way for more than 1,000 immigrants separated by U.S. officials to have their asylum claims reconsidered. Department of Justice attorneys at the time promised the court the government would ""get moving"" on the agreement.
U.S. Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego rejected the government's argument that it did not have to begin reconsidering asylum until the settlement was approved by the court. A hearing on the fairness of the settlement is scheduled for Nov. 15.
The settlement applied to about 2,500 children and their parents who were picked up after crossing the border and detained separately under the crackdown on illegal immigration under U.S. President Donald Trump, one of his signature policies. The administration abandoned family separations in June in the face of widespread condemnation.

On Thursday, Trump threatened to send the military to the border with Mexico to prevent thousands of migrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala from crossing into the United States from Mexico.

The country has been split between moderate and more radical forms of Islam since it was plunged into years of civil war in 1992, when a military-backed government canceled elections that an Islamist party was poised to win.
Most Algerian women do not wear the niqab, a custom imported from more traditionally conservative Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, but the decision is likely to criticized by Algeria's Salafists minority.
The Salafists endorse Saudi's strict Wahhabi version of Sunni Islam and oppose the more mainstream Sufi Islam that dominates Algeria and other North African countries. 
Violence has dramatically diminished since the war petered out around the turn of the millennium, but a hardcore of armed jihadist groups continue to launch attacks, mainly in remote areas.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>",U.S. student in boycott case allowed to stay in Israel: court,"By Ori Lewis
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An American student who was barred from entering Israel under a law against foreign activists who support boycotts of the state over its Palestinian policies was given permission to stay in the country by the Supreme Court on Thursday.
In its ruling, the court criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to Lara Alqasem, 22, saying their decision gave ""the unavoidable impression"" that she was barred for her political opinions.
If so, the justices said, it represented ""a radical and dangerous step that could lead to the crumbling of the foundations upon which Israel's democracy is built"".
Alqasem was refused entry when she flew to Israel on a study visa on Oct. 2. Security officials cited her role as president of a small local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Florida.
Her case touched off a debate in Israel over whether democratic values had been compromised by a 2017 law that bars the entry of foreigners who publicly support boycotts over Israel's policies toward the Palestinians.
Thursday's ruling, seen by Reuters, overturned a lower court decision that had backed the decision by Israeli authorities.
Alqasem said she was relieved by the court's decision and would speak more later. Her lawyers called the ruling ""a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the rule of law"".
Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who had denied Alqasem entry, said the government would look into the implications of the ruling.
""We will examine the legal criteria in order to ensure that the original intent of the law is maintained,"" he said. ""The principle that whoever acts to harm the State of Israel and its citizens should be refused entry must be preserved.""
""A DANGEROUS STEP""
Members of Israel's right-wing government have long criticized the court for being, in their eyes, too liberal in its interventions regarding policy toward Palestinians. 
The Supreme Court accepted Alqasem's lawyers’ argument that she had ceased her pro-boycott activity in April 2017, and noted that since then she had engaged in Holocaust studies and had been accepted to a post graduate program at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, which supported her petition.
""Since the petitioner's actions do not sufficiently warrant banning her entry to Israel, the unavoidable impression is that her political opinions were the reason behind the cancellation of the visa that was granted to her,"" the ruling said.
""If that is indeed the case, we are talking about a radical and dangerous step.""
The court cited in its decision the Hebrew University's contention that barring the entry, at the airport, of a foreign student accepted into an international program damaged the university's international ties.
However one justice wrote that if Alqasem ""returns to her old ways"" and promoted a boycott while she is in Israel, her stay could be canceled and she could be expelled.

It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli authorities would appeal the ruling.

Speaking in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Putin said the hostages included several U.S. and European nationals, adding that Islamic State was expanding its control in territory on the left bank of the River Euphrates controlled by U.S. and U.S.-backed forces.
Putin did not specify what the militants' demands were.
""They have issued ultimatums, specific demands and warned that if these ultimatums are not met they will execute 10 people every day. The day before yesterday they executed 10 people,"" Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in Sochi. 
The TASS news agency reported on Wednesday that Islamic State militants had taken around 700 hostages in Syria's Deir-al Zor province after attacking a refugee camp in an area controlled by U.S.-backed forces on Oct. 13.
TASS said the militants had kidnapped around 130 families and taken them to the city of Hajin.
In Washington, the U.S. military cast doubt on Putin's claims.
""While we have confirmed that there was an attack on an IDP (internally displaced persons) camp near (Deir-al Zor) last week, we have no information supporting the large number of hostages alleged by President Putin and we are skeptical of its accuracy,"" Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German Defence Ministry, under fire for its use of outside consultants, said on Thursday it is investigating possible misconduct by ministry officials and will shortly publish strict new guidelines for hiring external advisers.
Lawmakers grilled Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen about dozens of irregularities revealed in a scathing internal report by the Federal Audit Office leaked to German media last month about the ministry's hiring of consultants.
Opposition lawmakers from the pro-business Free Democrats and ecologist Greens threatened a parliamentary investigation unless they received more answers about the widening scandal.
The ministry said it was implementing a wide range of structural measures to prevent further mistakes, and an investigative team ""is examining indications about gross personal misconduct by individuals in connection with the awarding of contracts"", said spokesman Jens Flosdorff.
He said it was unclear if the individuals involved had acted for personal gain, or if reported irregularities were the result of carelessness or a too-lax process.
Von der Leyen, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, is already facing criticism for her leadership style, reliance on outside consultants, and continued gaps in military readiness.
Germany, the leading economy in Europe and a key force in the NATO security alliance, is under pressure from Washington to boost military spending and contribute more to Europe's defense.
""MULTIPLE QUESTIONS""
""There are still multiple questions about the extent of the use of external help, about contract award violations, about old-boy networks between the ministry and external parties,"" said Greens party member Tobias Lindner, one of those considering initiating a parliamentary inquiry.
Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, deputy head of the Free Democrats, said von der Leyen's statements to the committee ""raised more questions than they answered.""
Separately, the Berlin prosecutor's office confirmed on Thursday that it was reviewing an anonymous complaint that the ministry failed to pay proper benefits for external advisers who had essentially worked full-time at the ministry.
The ministry denied it had sought to evade the payments, and said it had asked for a federal review of filing requirements for six individuals on Sept. 25, before the complaint was filed.
Federal auditors estimated that the ministry spends up to 150 million euros a year on outside advisers and personnel, a sum ministry sources say is closer to 80 million euros a year.

They also fault the ministry for improperly hiring outside help under an umbrella IT contract, something the ministry blames on a mistaken assessment by experts at its procurement agency and the failure to properly document the process.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>","Top Afghan police chief killed in shooting, U.S. general unhurt","By Ismail Sameem and Hamid Shalizi
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - General Abdul Razeq, one of Afghanistan's most powerful security commanders, was killed on Thursday in a shooting attack by a bodyguard that dealt a severe blow to the Afghan government ahead of parliamentary elections on Saturday, officials said.
General Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan who had been at a meeting with Razeq and the governor of the southern province of Kandahar only moments earlier, was not injured in the attack.
But Razeq, the Kandahar police commander, and the local head of the NDS intelligence service were both fatally wounded before the attacker was himself killed. Kandahar Governor Zalmay Wesa was severely wounded and contradictory reports about whether he had survived could not immediately be resolved.
Taliban militants claimed responsibility for the assault, which decapitated the security command in one of the country's most strategically important and contested provinces.
The Taliban said they said they had targeted both Miller and Razeq, who had a fearsome reputation as a ruthless foe of the Islamist insurgents in their southern Afghan heartland.
Security officials had warned of likely attacks ahead of the election but the death of Razeq caused deep shock that officials fear may keep away voters, after Taliban warnings not to take part in what they consider a foreign-imposed ballot.
""General Razeq's death will have a huge impact on security and the election in the south because a lot of voters may not feel safe to go to vote,"" said a senior security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Taliban released a picture of a young man in military-style uniform who they said was the attacker and Afghan officials identified him by the name of Gulbuddin.
It remained unclear how the insurgents managed to infiltrate a gunman so close to such senior commanders. 
Officials said Razeq, Miller and the other officials were walking toward a landing zone as the helicopter taking the U.S. general's party back to Kabul approached to land when the gunman, who was waiting outside, opened fire on the group.
""Provincial officials including the governor, the police chief and other officials were accompanying the foreign guests to the aircraft when the gunshots happened,"" said Said Jan Khakrezwal, the head of the provincial council.
The attack underlined how precarious the situation remains in Afghanistan even after Taliban and U.S. officials have opened preliminary contacts aimed at establishing the basis for future peace talks.
But a Pentagon spokesman said Washington remained committed to its strategy of maintaining heavy military pressure on the Taliban to force the insurgents to the negotiating table.
""This attack will not change U.S. resolve in our South Asia strategy. If anything, it makes us more resolute,"" U.S. Defense Department spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner told Reuters.
BODY ARMOR
President Ashraf Ghani said a team led by the head of the NDS, Masoom Stanekzai, would be sent to Kandahar to bring the situation under control and investigate the incident, which sharply heightens security concerns around Saturday's election.
At least two hand grenade explosions and sporadic gunfire from around the compound were also reported by officials, in a sign the attack was carefully coordinated.
The three Afghan officials were all hit in the fusillade from the gunman and two Americans and a coalition contractor were hit in the crossfire. But Miller, who took command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the NATO-led Resolute Support mission last month, was not harmed.
""The brutal police chief of Kandahar has been killed along several other officials,"" a Taliban statement said.
A flamboyant commander, whose men wore badges bearing his name, Razeq had survived several attempts on his life over the years and narrowly escaped an attack last year in which five diplomats from the United Arab Emirates were killed in Kandahar.
A U.S. Embassy official said eyewitness reports indicated that claims Miller was a target in the attack were false, but he gave no detail.
Local officials said Miller appeared to have been saved by his body armor but there was no immediate confirmation from NATO headquarters.
Razeq was criticized by human rights groups but highly respected by U.S. officers who saw him as one of Afghanistan's most effective commanders, largely responsible for keeping Kandahar under control.
Although technically only a police commander, he was a powerful political figure in his own right and had clashed repeatedly with Ghani in the past, using his unchallenged position in Kandahar to resist attempts to sack him. 

A cameramen working for Afghanistan's RTA state television was also killed on Thursday, according to the director of the Afghanistan journalists center, Ahmad Quraishi.

The comments, which aggravated already tense relations caused by a moratorium on German arms exports to Saudi Arabia, led Riyadh to withdraw its ambassador and freeze out German companies, particularly in the lucrative healthcare sector.

PARIS (Reuters) - France pulled its finance minister out of a Saudi investment conference on Thursday in response to the unexplained disappearance of a journalist but voiced confidence that relations between the allies would not be hurt.
Turkey says Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed by Saudi agents in Riyadh's diplomatic mission in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and his body cut up. Saudi Arabia denies the allegation.
Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic and commercial relations spanning energy, finance and weapons. But France, which considers Riyadh a bulwark against Iranian influence in the Middle East, now faces a delicate balancing act in its response to the incident.
President Emmanuel Macron last Friday sought to downplay the importance of relations with Riyadh, saying the kingdom was not a major client of France. But Defence Minister Florence Parly told lawmakers on Wednesday that arms sales to Saudi were crucial for French jobs. 
On Thursday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire added his name to a growing list of government ministers, prominent business executives and leaders of international institutions who have canceled their attendance at a high-profile Saudi investment conference due to unease over Khashoggi's disappearance.
""No, I will not be going. The allegations are serious""."" Le Maire told Public Senat TV.
Saudi authorities needed to explain what had happened to Khashoggi after he went to the Saudi consulate, the last time he was seen in public, he said.
When asked if the move might jeopardize relations between the two countries, Le Maire replied: ""Absolutely not.""
ARMS SALES
Saudi Arabia is France's largest market in the Middle East, even without arms sales. French exports to the Gulf nation were totaled almost 4 billion euros ($4.61 billion) between September 2017 to August 2018, according to economy ministry data.
That figure does not include deals with French firms worth $12 billion that Saudi state-oil giant Aramco's announced in April, including a $5 billion petrochemicals complex with oil giant Total. 
French defense ministry data shows that from 2008 to 2017, Saudi Arabia was the second biggest purchaser of French arms, with deals totaling more than 11 billion euros ($12.67 billion). In 2017 alone, licenses potentially worth 14.7 billion euros to Saudi were approved. 
""Our industrial and defense base increasingly needs these weapons' exports,"" Parly told a Senate hearing on Wednesday. ""We can not totally ignore the impact that all this has on our defense industries and our jobs.""
Macron has shied away from publicly criticizing Crown Prince Mohammed despite international concerns over a crackdown on dissidents and unease over the high number of civilian casualties from Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen.

However, in talks with humanitarian groups in September, Macron said he was skeptical of Prince Mohammed's social reform agenda.

WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday gave Saudi Arabia more time to investigate journalist Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin abandoned plans to attend an investor conference in Riyadh, putting the high-profile event in doubt.
In Istanbul, Turkish investigators for a second time searched the Saudi consulate, where Khashoggi - a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist who was a strong critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - vanished on Oct. 2, in a hunt for clues about an incident that has caused a global outcry.
President Donald Trump met at the White House for less than an hour with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who gave Trump an update on his talks this week with Saudi and Turkish officials about the Khashoggi case. Turkish officials have said they believe the Saudi journalist was murdered at the consulate and his body chopped up and removed.
Referring to the Saudis, Pompeo said he told Trump that ""we ought to give them a few more days to complete"" their investigation in order to get a full understanding of what happened ""at which point we can make decisions about how - or if - the United States should respond to the incident surrounding Mr. Khashoggi.""
By casting doubt on whether the United States will respond at all, Pompeo reflected the internal struggle among Trump and his national security advisers on what to do should the Saudi leadership be blamed for what happened to Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia has denied involvement in the disappearance.
The United States considers Riyadh a linchpin in efforts to contain Iran's regional influence and a key global oil source, and Trump has shown no inclination to mete out harsh punishment to the Saudis.
In a Twitter post, Trump said he discussed what he called ""the Saudi situation"" with Pompeo ""in great detail"" after the diplomat's visits to Riyadh and Ankara.
""I think it's important for us all to remember, too - we have a long, since 1932, a long strategic relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" Pompeo told reporters after meeting with Trump, also calling Saudi Arabia ""an important counterterrorism partner.""
Trump is under pressure including from fellow Republicans in Congress who have said the United States must not let Saudi Arabia escape without punishment.
""Must not accept a strategic alliance with #SaudiArabia which requires our silence when they butcher a political critic,"" Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter. ""We must: 1. Hold everyone responsible for #KashoggiMurder accountable; & 2. Be clear on what is expected moving forward if they want to preserve our alliance.""
Mnuchin became the latest Western official to pull out of the high-profile investment conference in Riyadh later this month, joining a list of international officials and business executives to boycott the event. Earlier on Thursday, three senior European ministers said they were pulling out, too.
Mnuchin's withdrawal put the conference's fate in question. As of Thursday, the conference was still going on. The spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which is hosting the event, was not immediately available for comment. The organizers could not be reached for comment.
Mnuchin wrote on Twitter he had met with Trump and Pompeo ""and we have decided, I will not be participating in the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia.""
Pompeo told reporters that he made clear to the Saudis in his visit to Riyadh that ""we take this matter with respect to Mr. Khashoggi very seriously.""
""They made clear to me that they too understand the serious nature of the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi. They also assured me that they will conduct a complete, thorough investigation of all of the facts surrounding Mr. Khashoggi and that they will do so in a timely fashion,"" Pompeo added.
CONSULATE SEARCH
Turkish investigators left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul early on Thursday after searching the building and consular vehicles, a Reuters witness said. They used bright lights to illuminate the garden. Earlier, they spent nearly nine hours in the Saudi consul's residence along with Saudi investigators.
The Turkish search, which used a drone, included the roof and garage.
Khashoggi had gone to the consulate seeking documents for his planned upcoming marriage and has not been seen since.
The incident poses a dilemma for the United States and other Western nations, which have lucrative business dealings with the authoritarian kingdom and count on it as a leading Middle East ally and opponent of their common enemy Iran. Saudi Arabia also wields significant influence as the world's top oil exporter.
How Western allies deal with Riyadh will hinge on the extent to which they believe responsibility for Khashoggi's disappearance lies with Prince Mohammed and the Saudi authorities.
Trump, who has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and the 33-year-old prince, has speculated without providing evidence that ""rogue killers"" could be responsible.
U.N. INVESTIGATION URGED
Four Western rights groups - Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders - urged Turkey to ask the United Nations to investigate Khashoggi's disappearance.
""U.N. involvement is the best guarantee against a Saudi whitewash or attempts by other governments to sweep the issue under the carpet to preserve lucrative business ties with Riyadh,"" said Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
In pulling out of the conference in Riyadh, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire cited concerns about the Khashoggi matter. British trade minister Liam Fox followed suit, with his spokesman saying: ""Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account.""
Dutch Finance Minister Wopka Hoekstra also scrapped plans to attend while the Dutch government canceled a trade mission to Saudi Arabia next month.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow did not have enough information about Khashoggi's disappearance to justify harming ties with Riyadh. His government will wait for details, Putin told a forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
A U.S. government source said that U.S. intelligence agencies are increasingly convinced of the crown prince's culpability in the operation against Khashoggi, which they believe resulted in his death.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it would allow U.S. airlines and codeshare partners to resume flights at three Ukrainian airports and over parts of the Black Sea, citing improved safety and security in parts of Ukraine.
The FAA had barred flights over the war zones of Crimea and the Ukraine in April 2014, and expanded prohibitions after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down while it flew over eastern Ukraine, killing nearly 300 people on board. 
The FAA said in a notice filed on a government website it would maintain prohibitions on flights over the Crimea and parts of Ukraine. 
The air safety agency said it would allow takeoffs and landings at Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia international airports in Ukraine, saying operations could be conducted with ""minimal additional risk."" 
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, prompting international condemnation and Western sanctions, but since then there have been no major outbreaks of violence on the peninsula.
The FAA said security and safety conditions ""have sufficiently stabilized in certain regions of Ukraine"" to allow for additional flight operations. There have been over two years of safe flight operations on Black Sea air routes by non-U.S. airlines, prompting the change, it said.
The FAA said it was allowing flights to the three additional Ukraine airports, including one serving Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, because it believed there was enough of a ""buffer from the area of fighting and associated weapons capabilities.""

The rules, which are currently scheduled to last until October 2020, also apply to foreign airlines operating a U.S. airline codeshare flight.

MORONI (Reuters) - Comoros authorities have cut off water and power supplies in the capital city of Anjouan province as part of efforts to quell unrest against constitutional changes to extend presidential term limits, residents said on Thursday.
Anjouan has been rattled by clashes pitting soldiers against protesters angry at President Azali Assoumani's plans to end a rotating tenure in his post in a way critics say could leave the small island permanently excluded from power in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation.
On Wednesday, government officials said soldiers shot dead two people and wounded four after violence broke out in the Anjouan capital Mutsumudu between masked men and the military.
""They have cut water and electricity. (But) the hooded protesters are not the ones suffering, it is the population which have been taken like hostages,"" a resident of Mutsumudu told Reuters. 
""If this continues, we risk starving to death. We are praying that it ends quickly,"" added the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Officials at the Interior Ministry could not be reached for comment on the reported power and water outages.
Another witness - a university student - said Mutsumudu was shelled by the military throughout Wednesday.
""Since yesterday evening, Mutsamudu has had no respite. There was an exchange of fire - they even shelled the city,"" the student said, adding that his pregnant sister had to walk for hours to reach hospital due to the violence.
Interior Minister Mohamed Daoud blamed what he called ""insurgents"" for the violence: ""We do not wish for this to happen and we will do all we can to stop further damage.""
In August, Assoumani - who is from the largest island, Grande Comore - said a June referendum had approved the extension of presidential term limits and an end to the rotating presidency. The opposition called the referendum illegal.
Assoumani plans to compete in presidential polls in early 2019. That would deny Anjouan its turn to occupy the presidency from 2021, as would have happened under the previous system that rotated the post among the country's three main islands.
Assoumani, a former military officer, joins a string of African leaders who have extended presidential term limits or amended the constitution in order to stay in office.
He has been in power since 2016 and would have had to step down in 2021 under the old term limits. 

Speaking at a ceremony in the national capital Moroni, Assoumani warned protesters against further action. ""Nobody must try to play with the security, peace and stability of this country because I will not tolerate (this),"" he said.

The firm's former deputy chairman, Mohammed Mahfouz al-Ansari, and two other officials face a criminal trial on charges that they manipulated the company's books and sent about $960 million into personal foreign bank accounts between 2011 and 2015.
The firm, then known as Tri Ocean, has since been renamed Mog Energy.
MENA and the source did not name the other two executives, giving only their initials, M.M.A and M.F.H.
Tamer Mostafa Ragheb, the current deputy chairman of Mog Energy, was questioned during the prosecution's investigation but was not a suspect, MENA and the source said.
Ragheb's statements to investigators led them to believe that the three defendants transferred over $18 million to personal bank accounts in Doha and Dubai between Feb. 2012 and September of that year, MENA said.
A receptionist at Mog Energy, when reached by phone, said he had no knowledge about the case.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain have given themselves a few more weeks to break the deadlock in their Brexit talks but for Brussels the delay seems mainly about Prime Minister Theresa May dealing with critics back in London.
An accord sketched by officials from both sides last weekend stalled because May's fractious government rejected a ""backstop"" insurance clause the EU wants in case future talks fail to forge a trade pact that avoids customs posts on the Irish border.
An EU offer to extend a status-quo transition period by a year to end-2021, keeping Britain in a customs union to diminish the chances of the backstop being triggered, was not enough.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier pledged at a summit to keep working ""calmly and patiently"". But many EU leaders see the main negotiations to be had now as being among May and her allies in London, possibly only after she gets a budget through parliament early next month. They see little scope now for the EU to move.
""We took our steps. We need to know what the other side wants - finally,"" said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, less than three years since Britons voted for an exit in a referendum. 
""This is pretty much it,"" an EU diplomat said of the weekend offer, which included a longer transition to give time for a customs deal. ""This is the deal - if ever there's to be one."" 
French President Emmanuel Macron noted the tricky ""political balance"" May faces at home -- her vital Northern Irish allies say the EU's backstop, by keeping Northern Ireland alone in the EU customs area, would break up the United Kingdom; and Brexit hardliners insist the UK must leave the EU customs union soon.
ACID TEST
All governments insist, though, that they want a deal in the coming weeks that can avoid chaos when Britain leaves in March.
There are limited ways to salvage an agreement.
The EU is firmly behind Ireland. It says any ""hard border"" infrastructure on its frontier with the British province of the island would revive sectarian conflict. Many small EU states see the willingness of big powers to risk trade with Britain to protect Ireland as an acid test of the value of EU membership.
That limits May's scope for rejecting any backstop at all. 
Her solution so far has been to offer to keep the British mainland also inside EU customs rules for a time. But the EU has rejected that because it says it appears to offer Britain too many trading advantages without deeper negotiations which it is only willing to start after Britain has left the Union.
Yet if a deal is to be struck, the focus will be finding a formulation that makes a customs border between Northern Ireland and the British mainland highly improbable and/or makes a UK-EU future customs zone more certain than Brussels now wants. And more permanent than May's hardline Brexit supports would accept.
""There are many ways to skin a cat,"" another EU diplomat working on the Brexit conundrum said. ""But only so many -- and we have looked at all of them. So it's either the backstop or all of the United Kingdom staying inside our customs zone.""

""Now, Britain must simply pick.""

871,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Peruvian judge frees opposition leader Fujimori from prison,"By Mitra Taj and Teresa Cespedes
LIMA (Reuters) - A Peruvian judge late on Wednesday freed conservative opposition leader Keiko Fujimori from jail where she spent the past week pending charges in a money laundering probe.
Judge Cesar Sahuanay said there was no legal basis for jailing Fujimori and 19 others before trial in connection with alleged payments from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction group at the center of the region's biggest ever graft probe.
Fujimori, the daughter of former autocrat Alberto Fujimori, called her arrest political persecution. She denied prosecutors' allegations that she was the head of a criminal group within her political party and a flight risk.
""I'm never going to flee the country,"" Fujimori said, reminding the court that she remained in Peru when her father escaped to Japan at the end of his 1990-2000 rightwing government. ""I didn't leave Peru in 2000. I was here as always with my head high. I've never obstructed justice.""
The ruling marked the second time this year that a court has released a prominent politician from so-called ""preventive prison,"" or pre-trial detention, a tool used by prosecutors to ensure suspects cooperate in the Odebrecht bribery probe.
In April, the country's top court freed former president Ollanta Humala, who had spent nine months in jail without trial over allegations he laundered money for Odebrecht. Humala denied wrongdoing.
Criticism of preventive prison has grown since Fujimori's arrest. But prosecutors say it is vital to ending impunity in a country with a storied history of high-profile flights.
Also on Wednesday, centrist President Martin Vizcarra announced he was replacing his interior minister after his government admitted that a judge at the center of a separate cronyism investigation had managed to flee to Spain.
Vizcarra's approval rating surged 16 points in an Ipsos survey this month after he threatened to dissolve Congress unless it passed his anti-graft proposals, which are supported by a majority of Peruvians.
A twice-defeated presidential candidate, Fujimori led her father's political movement following his 2007 imprisonment for human rights crimes. She now commands the country's most powerful opposition party. 
But Fujimori has seen her popularity plummet amid a broader backlash against established politicians in the wake of the Odebrecht scandal. Prosecutors have accused her of leading a criminal group that took $1.2 million in illegal funds from Odebrecht for her 2011 presidential campaign. She denies taking money from Odebrecht.

Earlier this month, a judge annulled a pardon granted to her father. He has been in hospital since the ruling.

Turkey, Greece and Cyprus's internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government have long disputed their overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the Mediterranean.
The ship Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa was carrying out seismic research activity, the foreign ministry said earlier.
It also said Turkey would continue to exercise its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over its continental shelf.
""We recommend that Greece abstain from acts that would cause an escalation in the region,"" the ministry said in a statement.

With the deployment clearly visible from main Israeli roads near the Gaza Strip, senior Egyptian security officials met leaders of the enclave's ruling Hamas to try to calm tensions.
Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group quickly denied firing the rockets.
Much may depend on the scope and intensity of a planned Palestinian protest at the border with Israel on Friday, where often violent demonstrations have been held over the past six months.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who convened his security cabinet on Wednesday after the rocket wrecked a home in the city of Beersheba, pledged to take ""very strong action"" if Palestinian attacks continued. 
Israeli leaders have said they will not tolerate rocket attacks or attempts, during the border protests, to breach Israel's frontier fence with the Palestinian territory of two million people.
A Reuters photographer counted some 60 tanks and armored personnel carriers at a deployment area near the border, calling it the largest number he has seen there since the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas.
In Gaza, a Palestinian official said the Egyptian delegation was also in contact with Israeli leaders to curb the current tensions.
""The situation is delicate. No one wants a war,"" he said. 
""Palestinian factions are demanding an end to the Israeli blockade that strangled life and business in Gaza,"" the official told Reuters.
Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza and the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel’s founding in 1948.
About 200 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops since the border protests began, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. Palestinians have launched incendiary balloons and kites into Israel and on occasion breached an Israeli frontier fence.
More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the coastal enclave. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border.

In addition to sporadic incidents, Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the past 10 years. The internationally-mediated peace process aimed at finding a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is all but moribund.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - As a member of the largest Jewish religious community in Jerusalem, Yossi Daitsh should have a big lead in the holy city's mayoral election race.
But Daitsh, an ultra-Orthodox Jew and Jerusalem's deputy mayor, is trailing three more liberal candidates ahead of the Oct. 30 ballot, when municipal polls are held nationally.
Some political analysts see that as a sign the ultra-Orthodox - known in Hebrew as ""haredim"", or piously ""awe-struck"" - feel freer to vote according to personal preference and independent of their rabbis' rulings.
If so, the Jerusalem mayoral race could be a bellwether of ultra-Orthodox integration in wider Israeli society, where welfare benefits and military draft exemptions for the community have long been resented by the secular middle-class. 
But reluctance among the ultra-Orthodox to rally around any single candidate also points to long-standing political splits among the community's three main streams in Jerusalem, which has had only one haredi mayor, from 2003 to 2008.
Yair Ettinger, a scholar with the Israel Democracy Institute and the Shalom Hartman Institute, said ultra-Orthodox society is at a turning point, with some members breaking away from rabbis' rulings, and ""this may well manifest in the Jerusalem election"".
Ultra-Orthodox men have traditionally stayed out of the military and workforce by devoting themselves to full-time religious studies. 
That has raised concern that a lack of skills within the community will ultimately harm Israel's long-term economic health and many Israelis would rather see them integrate into mainstream society.
Fuelled by high birthrates, the ultra-Orthodox make up 10 percent of Israel's majority Jews, and more than triple that - 36 percent - in Jerusalem.
In the Jerusalem municipality's administrative city council, haredim hold 14 of the 31 seats. One survey, on Oct. 12, predicted that could drop to 8 in the upcoming vote - indicating a shift of haredi support to non-Orthodox party lists.
Twenty-one percent of Jerusalem Jews are secular, like the election frontrunner - former Deputy Mayor Ofer Berkovitch - and the outgoing incumbent mayor, Nir Barkat. Another 43 percent are non-haredi but religiously traditional.
Palestinians, who make up a third of Jerusalem's population, are mostly boycotting the election, as they have done for decades, in protest at Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, seized in the 1967 war.
Black-coated and heavily bearded, Daitsh, a 50-year-old grandfather, has cast widely for votes. His online biography plays up his years of army service, a haredi rarity. He joined Twitter last month and sent his first selfie last week.

He has been endorsed by one ultra-Orthodox branch, while the two others have backed career bureaucrat Moshe Lion, a non-haredi, a candidate opinion polls put in second place.

""This decision is driven by our global efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""It does not signal a change of U.S. policy on Jerusalem, the West Bank, or the Gaza Strip.""
The consulate-general in Jerusalem is the top mission for Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem for their capital. 
""We will continue to conduct a full range of reporting, outreach, and programming in the West Bank and Gaza as well as with Palestinians in Jerusalem through a new Palestinian Affairs Unit inside U.S. Embassy Jerusalem,"" Pompeo said.  
He said the Trump administration was committed to a peace effort between Israel and the Palestinians.
U.S. President Donald Trump outraged the Arab world and stoked international concern by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes between Israel and the Palestinians and Palestinian leaders accused Trump of sowing instability by overturning decades of U.S. policy.
Palestinians, with broad international backing, seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed, as its ""eternal and indivisible capital,"" but that is not recognized internationally. The Trump administration has avoided that description, and noted that the city’s final borders should be decided by the parties.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Parliament in Kosovo, Europe's newest independent state which relies on NATO troops for its protection, voted on Thursday to set up a 5,000-strong national army though its Serb minority said the move was illegal.
Serb deputies, backed by Belgrade which does not recognize Kosovo's independence, have blocked any such move in the past saying creation of a national army required a change to the constitution.
But three laws promoted by the Kosovo government and passed by a parliamentary vote on Thursday simply upgraded the mandate of the lightly-armed domestic Kosovo Security Force (KSF) to become a national army - something which the government said did not require any changes to the constitution.
The vote was passed with 98 in favor in the 120-seat parliament, though it was boycotted by the legislature's 11 Serb deputies. A second vote will be required in the next few days.
""The three laws have one task, to protect the territorial integrity of Kosovo, to protect the citizens of all communities in Kosovo,"" Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said before the vote.
The landlocked Balkan territory of 1.8 million, which declared independence in 2008, is still guarded by 4,000 stationed NATO troops nearly two decades after the end of the war.
NATO moved into the fledgling state in June 1999 following weeks of air strikes to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanian civilians by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
The United States and most of the European Union member states recognize Kosovo. But objections by permanent Security Council members Russia and China which back Serbia in not accepting Kosovo's statehood prevent it from being a member of the United Nations.
The laws passed said the new army would have 5,000 active soldiers and 3,000 reservists. The present KSF security force is a lightly armed, 2,500-strong force trained by NATO and tasked with crisis response, civil protection and ordinance disposal.
NATO says it has no plans to leave the territory just now, but it suggested that any change to the status of the KSF might lead to a reduction in its forces there.
""Any change in the structure, mandate and mission of the Kosovo Security Forces is for the Kosovo authorities to decide,"" a NATO official told Reuters in an e-mailed answer.

""NATO supports the Kosovo Security Force under its current mandate. Should this mandate evolve, the North Atlantic Council will have to re-examine the level of NATO’s engagement in Kosovo. We cannot predict decisions by the North Atlantic Council.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The head of the European Parliament said on Thursday EU countries who refuse to host refugees could instead pay more for EU migration and development projects in Africa, signaling possible compromise to end a bruising dispute in the bloc.
The migration feud has divided southern and eastern EU states as well as rich destination countries such as Germany since 2015, when more than one million refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa reached the bloc's borders. 
But the tone of the discussion has changed recently after years of one camp insisting that all EU states must take in some migrants and the other side rejecting that.
""No relocation - (then) more money for Africa,"" European Parliament President Antonio Tajani told a news conference on Thursday as the bloc's 28 national leaders discussed migration.
""This should be a good compromise. It's better to have an agreement with a compromise than no agreement,"" he said.
Mediterranean arrivals of migrants and refugees are below 100,000 people so far this year, according to United Nations data, a far cry from the 2015 influx that caught the bloc unprepared and overwhelmed security and other public services.
The EU has since tightened its external borders, has turned more restrictive on granting asylum and has sealed deals with countries from Turkey to Libya to keep a lid on migrants departing their territory by sea for EU shores.
EU will further step up returns and deportations of those who reach Europe but do not qualify for asylum, a statement of the 28 national leaders' meeting in Brussels on Thursday said. 
The bloc will seek to build ""a broader partnership"" with countries along the migratory routes, mainly in North Africa, including to crack down on people smugglers.
The chaotic scenes from 2015 are still reverberating in European politics, which has since seen a surge in support for anti-immigration, populist and nationalist groups. But fewer arrivals now mean some of the heat is off, making a deal easier. 
The eastern, formerly communist EU states like Poland and Hungary, remain adamant that they will not allow in any refugees from mainly Muslim countries. 
Germany, France and the Netherlands, which had previously demanded solidarity from all EU states, may be more open now to allowing their reluctant peers to buy out of the refugee distribution scheme as a way of sealing a deal, diplomats said.
""We cannot force (others to take in refugees), but those that do not do so must possibly contribute in another way such as...in Africa. Everyone needs to take on some of the responsibility that we all have,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told his EU peers recently.

Any political agreement is likely to take more time, diplomats and officials said, not least because Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the euroskeptic Italian government have built their political clout on an anti-immigration line and criticism of how the EU has handled migration.

The death toll, including suspect 18-year-old Vladislav Roslyakov, rose to 21 on Thursday, Russian agencies cited the Russian Healthy Ministry as saying. 
The Investigative Committee said it was still working to establish the motive for the attack that recalled similar shooting sprees carried out by students in U.S. schools. 
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, prompting international condemnation and Western sanctions, but since then there have been no major outbreaks of violence on the peninsula.

The Russia-backed government in Crimea published a list of the victims, most of whom were teenagers.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:59AM ET</span>","With transition talk, Britain's May tries to unlock Brexit deal","By Elizabeth Piper and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May signaled on Thursday she would consider extending a so-called transition period ""for a matter of months"" after Britain leaves the European Union, a move her critics say is a betrayal of Brexit.
Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, Brexit talks have stalled over how to deal with their only land border, between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
At an EU summit in Brussels, while the mood was more upbeat about the willingness for a deal to ease Britain's exit, several leaders and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike the kind of breakthrough needed to move forward.
The problem centers on a so-called backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions, if a future trading relationship is not in place in time.
Extending the transition period could mean that if a future partnership is not ready, a backstop, which so far has been unpalatable to the British side, would not have to be triggered. But even an extension will not get rid of the EU's insistence that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.
""A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at this stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter months,"" May told reporters on the second day of the summit.
""But the point is, this is not expected to be used because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020.""
A senior British government official tried to play down the significance of May's consideration of such an extension, saying it had only ""come up in negotiations in recent days"" and that it was one of several options to help move the talks on - something London desperately wants to see.
And a French official said any extension would come with conditions attached - it would not be automatic, it would be decided closer to the time and that it would have to be agreed by the leaders of the 27 other EU nations, probably unanimously.
""TRUST""
May has tried to use the summit in Brussels - once seen as the stage for a possible breakthrough after more than a year of talks - to offer a softer tone to her EU counterparts after another such meeting last month ended in acrimony.
Before leaving them to dine on Wednesday, May called for cooperation. ""The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides,"" she told leaders, according to an official.
Her plea was met by some understanding of her predicament.
May's plans have been criticized by all sides at home -- Brexit campaigners accuse her of making Britain a vassal state, EU supporters say they offer the worst of all worlds and others have expressed frustration over the lengthy talks.
She also faces a rebellion from her parliamentary partners, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which has threatened to vote against her government's budget if she concedes to the EU's demands over the backstop. They say the proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain.
Diane Dodds, an EU lawmaker from the DUP, said the extension did not ease her party's fears. ""All very well, but this doesn't do anything to actually change the backstop ... Therefore it does not address any concerns, it offers no reassurance.""
With a crucial vote in parliament on any deal, May, who lost her Conservative Party's majority in an election last year, risks a damaging defeat. That could trigger a leadership contest, a so-called no deal Brexit and even a new election.
The parliamentary vote, and May's political struggles, were the focus of much of the other EU leaders' dinner late on Wednesday, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said. 
But a senior EU diplomat was more blunt. ""There is nothing. We have nothing. For now, we have a no-deal,"" the diplomat said, adding leaders were waiting for Britain's budget, due to be presented to parliament in late October, to be passed.
With the talks stalled and little prospect of a quickening of pace anytime soon, many Brexit supporters and even critics of Britain's departure are airing their frustration over an exit which some campaigners had said would be the easiest deal ever.
And the suggestion -- first made by EU negotiators -- that Britain could stay firmly in the EU's sphere for longer than the 21 months expected has fired up those who already say Britain has already given up too much in the negotiations.

""Many Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are making clear to the government that we won't support legislation seeking to prolong transition and large payments for no good reason,"" said John Redwood, a Conservative Brexit supporter.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:51AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why Poland fell out of step with Europe,"WARSAW (Reuters) - By Lidia Kelly, Justyna Pawlak and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk 
Last winter, Monika Pawlik spent her days crawling through mud and digging trenches in frozen ground, training for Poland's home guard. Her daughter, Helena, hadn't yet turned 2 years old.
The town hall clerk is under no illusions about the potential risks of serving in the volunteer army, saying she is ready to die for the homeland. ""I understand that if there is a war, formations such as ours are sent to their death,"" she says. ""I think that I mainly did it for myself and probably from feeling a patriotic duty.""
Pawlik is a citizen of the European Union, but the 24-year-old's commitment to defend her nation reflects a mounting unease throughout Poland and elsewhere in the EU. Nearly 15,000 Poles have joined the country's volunteer forces since their inception in 2017, a number that Poland's military planners hope will reach 53,000 in the coming years. 
Poland is a fully paid-up member of NATO. As the biggest state to join the EU from the former Soviet bloc, it has received more EU support than any other member - over 100 billion euros ($115 billion), according to the Polish finance ministry. EU membership is popular. But many Poles - alongside Hungarians and Czechs in eastern Europe - are voicing discontent over foreign influence in their internal affairs. For instance, Poland and Hungary have defied an EU request to accept a quota of asylum-seekers. Parties like Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) are winning support by beating a patriotic drum, and the EU is among the targets.
This trend has deepened fractures across the Union, which commentators widely believe are rooted in financial crisis and the subsequent arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Syria and Africa. In Poland and other European countries that broke free from Soviet domination in 1989, however, the misgivings have long run far deeper.
Pawlik lives in a village of only several dozen people about 150 km (90 miles) from the eastern border with Russia's ally Belarus. Her small house, inherited from her grandmother, is adorned with pots of white and red flowers in the windows. She planted them with her husband as a tribute to Poland's white-and-red flag, to honor the centenary of Polish independence this year.
""I remember my grandmother telling me how the Germans used to pass through these forests and then the Russians,"" said Pawlik. ""She would tell me how a Russian would sometimes just go over and shoot your head off and a German would shrug, pretend not to see you and walk away.""
Many Poles recall bitter experiences in World War Two when Western allies failed to save the country from a Nazi German invasion and, later, allowed it to fester under Soviet domination. The PiS party, which won 37.6 percent of the vote and secured a parliamentary majority in 2015, is appealing mainly to rural, less educated and poorer voters who feel that while Europe's liberal ways may have made some people richer, they have not made anyone safer.
Poland's government has allied with Hungary, whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, has courted confrontation with Brussels as part of what he calls a ""national liberation struggle"" against globalization and the liberal ideas of the EU. PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has said Poland is following Orban's example. Both states have railed against internationalist left-wingers and courted nationalist leaders such as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump.
""We renounce this sack of stones we have been carrying on our backs as a nation since 1989,"" Kaczynski told crowds celebrating Polish Independence Day last Nov. 11. ""A sack of corruption, abuse, theft, dishonesty, immorality and destruction of Polish patriotism, Poland's sense of community.""
Many of Poland's EU allies are angry that its government is playing a leading role in fuelling a rift between ex-Communist and Western members of the bloc, at a time when the EU is grappling with Britain's decision to leave. They have accused Warsaw of a tilt toward authoritarianism, as the state increases its control of the judiciary, public media and parts of the economy.
In Brussels, senior EU officials say parties like PiS create a false distinction between patriotism and a sense of European community. ""Patriotism is a virtue,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a speech in September. ""Unchecked nationalism is riddled with both poison and deceit.""
Finding itself increasingly isolated within the bloc, the PiS government has also been more combative with Berlin, once a leading champion of Poland's EU membership aspirations. Warsaw says Germany still owes it billions of euros in World War Two reparations, and has told Poles that Berlin should pay the money back.
A German government spokeswoman said: ""The federal government currently has no official request from Poland in relation to reparations claims on which it could comment.""
INSECURITY
Pawlik says she has no political views, but she is part of the core electorate for the PiS government. Its bedrock of support is rural communities, especially in the country's east.
Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, a large part of the cash it received has been devoted to big projects like roads and bridges. But under PiS, individual incomes in rural areas have also been helped by government programs to give new child benefits and increase the minimum wage.
For Pawlik and others, Brussels has disappointed at a more basic level. Since Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, many people in Poland say they have been nervous of Russian aggression. Before Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, just 15 percent of Poles worried that their country's independence may be under threat. That jumped after Russia intervened in Ukraine, and the number runs at 40 percent now.
There has recently been a massive build-up of Russian conventional forces on the borders of the Baltic states. But the EU has very limited joint defense capabilities. 
This is why people like Pawlik joined the Territorial Defence Forces (WOT) - a formation that requires recruits to spend four months over three years in training. The force, modeled on America's National Guard, is an integral part of Poland's defense and deterrence potential alongside land, air, navy and special operations, the defense ministry says. Poland's military budget for 2018 envisages spending $153 million on the territorial defense forces, similar to the amount earmarked for the navy.
Poland's government has been spending around 2 percent of GDP on defense, as recommended by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and is planning to gradually raise this amount to 2.5 percent of GDP.
""Military treaties are important but they can give an often illusory sense of power. We need to be ready to defend ourselves ... until our allies arrive with help,"" Tadeusz Cymanski, a senior PiS lawmaker, said in an interview. ""If we want to preserve our independence, the current generation ought to have a sense of national pride, a sense of community and a willingness to sacrifice.""
A volunteer army is an important symbol. Poland has for centuries been invaded or carved up by its neighbors - Austria, Germany and Russia until 1918, and later, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In World War Two, hundreds of thousands of Poles joined an underground Home Army to defend the country after its government was forced into exile.
A poll by the state-controlled polling agency CBOS showed in August that 88 percent of the population today believes being patriotic means being willing to fight and die for the country.
""TOWARDS MATURITY""
Being in the EU has disappointed Poles in other ways. After Poland joined, labor markets opened up abroad. Poles left in droves to seek work, dividing families and draining local labor.
More than 2 million, out of a population of over 38 million Poles, recently moved to live abroad, drawn out of important services such as healthcare to countries including Britain and Germany. The population of Pawlik's county, Ostrow Mazowiecka, has fallen by almost three percent since 2004 and she worries there may not be enough people to help defend those who stayed behind.
""I hope Helena never moves abroad,"" said Pawlik, playing with her daughter in her garden. ""I hope she has a better sense of what her ancestors have done for her. And I think her children will not have to leave for abroad. I am not a supporter of finding work away from home.""
While EU membership has allowed large numbers of Poles to seek work abroad under free movement rules, the EU says the long-term thrust of its policy is to help narrow the gaps between living standards across the continent.
Overall, Poland's population has nudged up 0.7 percent, but the government is trying to encourage more growth, primarily by paying out generous child subsidies, promising pensions for women who have at least four children but have not worked enough to earn a pension, and offering cheaper public housing.
The health ministry has also sponsored a booklet called ""Towards maturity"" for school instructors on family and reproductive health, with a stated aim of ""preventing a tendency to postpone procreation."" Included in it is a statement that promiscuity ""changes a woman's psyche,"" because ""a woman's nature is to devote herself entirely to a beloved man.""
NOT GERMANY
For Pawlik, there has also been a hollowness in EU membership. She says she once did an internship in her local town hall that was funded by the European Union. It paid better than a regular internship, but she had to display a poster saying who paid for her work. She felt it was like a plaque saying, ""'This hinge has been oiled with EU funds.'""
A European Commission official said such a poster is not an EU requirement.
Przemyslaw Sadura, a sociologist of education from the Warsaw University Institute of Sociology, says national governments such as Poland's are filling a void left by Brussels in telling people stories that can motivate them and make sense of life.
""The EU was not able to forge its own story, its own myth; it couldn't weave together national stories into a single tale,"" he said. PiS, he said, ""has a vision. It encompasses patriotism, a vision for the modernization of Poland, a national engagement, a national economy. It's about ethnic community.""
EU Commission officials say they have no simple answers to what they view as a global trend, of politicians who exploit people's unease with change by appealing to nostalgia for a national past. But such attitudes generate frustration that Brussels officials rarely voice in public. ""Central Europe loves a sense of victimization,"" one senior EU official told Reuters privately, acknowledging the difficulty institutions have in responding to complaints from Warsaw and Budapest.
As it builds its nostalgic story, PiS has introduced a sweeping reform of school programs, focusing in particular on history, literature, civics and geography. From now, school children will be taught about the ""benefits and costs"" of EU membership, according to education ministry documents. The ministry mandated the added word, ""costs.""
The new core curriculum says that ""the aim of schooling is to strengthen the sense of national identity, connection to history and national traditions.""
That includes Poland's status as a victim of Nazi Germany. Many Poles feel the West has failed to acknowledge the depth of the nation's suffering under the occupation, focusing instead only on the Jewish Holocaust. The government says some Poles have been unjustly vilified as perpetrators of atrocities against the Jews. In fact, some sheltered Jews. And Poles themselves were deemed ""sub-human"" by the Nazis.
Earlier this year, Poland's government passed a law that would allow the courts to jail anyone suggesting the Polish nation was complicit in the Holocaust. Under pressure from the United States, it later watered that down to remove jail terms. 
At the same time, the education ministry has canceled an obligation for schools to give anti-discrimination workshops. A school superintendent, appointed by PiS, recently urged teenagers to follow the example of a 17th-century king who fought against the Ottoman empire. The superintendent was quoted in the media as saying the great king ""managed to defend the whole of Europe against Islam.""
In the fourth grade, when history is introduced as a subject, children aged 9 to 10 are presented with vignettes of around two dozen historic figures designed to promote a sense of national pride. These characters are described by the education ministry as having ""a momentous impact on the formation of the Polish cultural identity.""
They include Christian kings, a Polish-born Pope (John Paul II) who inspired the nation to stand up to communism, Marie Sklodowska-Curie, who won the Nobel Prize for her research on radioactivity, and the Solidarity movement which spearheaded the end of Communist rule in Europe.
""History should arouse pride,"" said Wlodzimierz Suleja, the historian who developed the new programs. ""Our history is grand ... We were exceptional in Europe."" He says he is referring to the fact Poles were able to sustain a sense of nationhood when the country was overrun by others.
To many in Poland, which has for centuries embraced Catholicism as a way to distinguish its culture from Protestant Germany and Orthodox Russia, religious values are fundamental. One town has engraved marble tablets with the Ten Commandments to be hung at the entrances to local schools.
Pawlik says when she was at school, the system failed to teach her an appreciation of her own heritage. ""Our system tends to focus on teaching the history of Germany, its kings, Russia. We didn't learn much about Poland,"" she said. ""We need to focus on what happened here.""
SACRIFICE
At the heart of the PiS story is a group of fighters who kept an underground resistance going even after the end of World War Two, turning against the Communist authorities.
PiS holds up the fighters, known as the Doomed or Cursed Soldiers, as a model for youth, praising them for being uncompromising, unyielding and willing to be martyred despite having the odds stacked against them.
Controversy surrounds them. Several have been accused of killing civilian villagers, often Jews, Slovaks and Belarusians, as they sought to resist Soviet authorities setting up a Communist state in Poland.
But they are the example for Pawlik and other fighters in the territorial defense forces. In a ceremony in 2016, President Andrzej Duda called them ""the last of the great heroes"" who sacrificed their lives for the country. 
One of the Doomed Soldiers is a woman known by her nom de guerre, Inka. A 17-year-old medic and member of the Home Army in World War Two, she was sentenced to death by the Communist authorities and refused to sign a plea for clemency. Before her death, she wrote a note to relatives, saying, ""I am sad that I have to die. Please tell my grandmother that I behaved as one should.""
When Pawlik was doing her training, she says, she learned how to fire weapons and was surprised to find she was no weaker than the men. She wants to be a professional soldier.

""If I go for something, I take it to the end,"" she said. ""But I'm not doing it all for myself. I'm also doing this for the baby.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Thursday that soldiers who marched on his palace last week had ""nefarious aims"" and wanted to abort the government's reforms.
In an address to parliament, Abiy gave details for the first time of the incident that took place on Oct. 10 in which he met with several hundred soldiers. The government had initially said they marched on his office to demand pay rises. 
""The approach taken (by the soldiers) was not only unconstitutional and dangerous, the intent was to abort reforms,"" Abiy said. ""Five to 10 people with nefarious aims"" had instructed the soldiers."" He gave no further details.
""Had we not taken a cautious approach, it could have led to a dangerous situation.""

The incident took place amid a spate of violence that has displaced over 2.2 million people posing a challenge for Abiy who took power in April and has instituted a series of reforms.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",German AfD members monitored by spy agency are now Bavarian lawmakers,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - Some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria who are under surveillance for alleged links to extremist groups won seats in its parliamentary election at the weekend, the state's intelligence agency said.
An agency spokesman said on Thursday that the Bavarian domestic intelligence agency was checking whether it has a constitutional mandate to continue monitoring those individuals, who are now lawmakers in the state assembly.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition is divided over whether the federal intelligence agency should monitor the AfD, which entered the national parliament for the first time in an election last year after campaigning on an anti-Islam platform.
In Bavaria, the party - which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution - secured 22 seats in the regional parliament based on a little over 10 percent of the vote. It drew some traditional voters from Merkel's conservative allies in the state, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
""Among the people under surveillance by the Bavarian domestic intelligence agency are individuals who won a mandate for the AfD in the election on Oct. 14,"" the Bavarian intelligence service spokesman wrote in an email.
He declined to say how many of the 22 AfD lawmakers are under surveillance. The AfD's leader in Bavaria did not respond to an email seeking comment. The story was first reported by the Muenchner Merkur newspaper. 
The intelligence agency spokesman said a low double-digit number of AfD members were being monitored for suspected links to anti-Islamic and ""right-wing extremist"" groups as well as to the anti-government Reichsbuerger movement, which claims that the modern-day Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate.
CHEMNITZ CLASHES
Pressure grew on Merkel's government to order federal agents to start monitoring the AfD after its supporters held protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month to denounce the fatal stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants.
Skinheads clashed with police soon after a Syrian and an Iraqi were identified as suspects, and a mob attacked a Jewish restaurant, exposing bitter divisions over Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim migrants.
Soon after the protests in Chemnitz, the states of Lower Saxony and Bremen said their security services had placed the AfD's youth wings under surveillance for suspected unconstitutional activities.
But Merkel rejected calls to put the AfD, now Germany's largest opposition party, under surveillance, saying it was the job of intelligence officials, not politicians, to make such decisions based on facts.
However, leaders of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), junior coalition partners of Merkel's conservatives, said the clashes in Chemnitz gave clear cause for a renewed look at whether the AfD should be monitored.

Memories of Nazi and Communist oppression between 1933 and 1989 have made Germans very cautious about state surveillance, but a poll published last month found that 57 percent agreed that the AfD should be monitored.

YANGON (Reuters) - The estranged brother of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Thursday he is making a new bid to sell the lakeside house where the democracy activist turned politician spent 15 years under house arrest.
Aung San Oo, who spends most of his time in the United States, submitted an appeal at the supreme court on Wednesday to auction off the once-grand white family home on the shores of Yangon’s Inya Lake which his lawyer has valued at $90 million.
The pair have tussled over the house since 2001, when he first sued for a share of the property. 
Imprisoned there in 1989 by the then ruling military, Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, spent 15 of the following 21 years confined to its grounds.
A Yangon court ruled in 2016 that Suu Kyi owned the main building while another building and some of the surrounding land belonged to her brother. 
""The previous decision was biased and they gave her more than half and so I am not satisfied and I am asking this right now,” Aung San Oo told Reuters by telephone. 
""I already let her live for free for 12 years. There is a limitation.”
His new legal challenge comes as Suu Kyi, now ruling the country as state counselor, faces multiple domestic and international crises, including foreign condemnation of her government’s handling of a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority and a weakening currency.
Nyan Win, spokesman for Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party, and her lawyer, could not be reached for comment. 
Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer calls requesting comment. He recently said he would not speak to media except at a biweekly news conference.
Aung San Oo’s lawyer, Aye Lwin, told Reuters his client decided to appeal because his share of the property had fallen into disrepair. 
""The building we got has already collapsed,” he said. “The other side got the two-story main building. They lived there the whole time and we couldn’t. He had to live outside.”
Suu Kyi gave impassioned speeches to crowds of supporters over the metal gates of the house at 54 University Avenue but she has not lived there since 2012, when she moved to the new capital, Naypyitaw, to enter parliament after her release. 
But the property has been the site of some of her most high-profile meetings, including with former U.S president Barack Obama and secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
NLD supporters voiced their dismay over the potential sale, with one, Nyi Nyi, a lawmaker for the Yangon regional parliament, vowing to raise money for her legal battle.

""This will become a historic place of a leader who fought for democracy and so, as a citizen, although I am not rich, I cannot lose the compound,"" he said.

The National Council for Security and Defence, which is headed by President Petro Poroshenko, established the special group ahead of presidential elections in March and parliamentary elections next October.
Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that Moscow backed.
""The experience of the United States and Western European countries shows that the Kremlin will try to influence (elections) through the cybernetic and informational space on socio-political processes,"" said Olexander Turchynov, secretary for the Council.

The firm helped investigate a series of high-profile cyber attacks on Ukraine in recent years. A report say which country did the hacking but blamed it on a group that has been accused by Britain of having links to Russian military intelligence.
Investigators at ESET said the group responsible for a series of earlier attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector, which used malicious software known as BlackEnergy, had now developed and used a new malware suite called GreyEnergy.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>","Chestnuts, swagger and good grammar: how Italy's 'Captain' builds his brand","By Steve Scherer
TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has doubled support for his far-right party in just seven months by cultivating a savvy social media presence that any politician would envy - including his inspiration, Donald Trump.
Salvini, who modeled his ""Italians first"" campaign after Trump's successful U.S. presidential bid, has built an effective communications machine aimed not just at bolstering his League party's popularity at home but also helping anti-immigrant, populist forces win control of European parliament next May.
Salvini has been especially successful on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Italy's most popular platform with 34 million active users per month out of an eligible voting population of 46.6 million.
Although Trump's page has more ""likes"" at 23.5 million versus Salvini's 3.2 million, the Italian's followers are more ""engaged"", according to data compiled by Pietro Raffa, a digital strategist for Milan communications consultancy MR & Associati. 
In the first week of July, for example, 2.6 million people liked, commented, shared or watched videos on Salvini's 82 Facebook posts, versus 1.5 million engagements on 32 posts for Trump, Raffa's data showed.
""Salvini always has much more engagement than Trump,"" Luca Morisi, Salvini's social media strategist and the man behind the machine, said at a workshop hosted by pollster and political analysis firm YouTrend in early October.
Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Reuters that U.S. politicians could learn a lot from Salvini's methods.
""The use of social media and Facebook Live... were state of the art,"" said Bannon, who has met Salvini more than once. ""I was blown away by how sophisticated he was and how he managed to do it on a shoestring.""
Much of the credit goes to Morisi, 45, who developed software for financial institutions before joining Salvini. His team of 10 works 24 hours a day if necessary, averaging 10 Facebook posts a day and spreading content across YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, and through Whatsapp and Telegram chat groups.
Using a specially designed matrix of software, collectively dubbed ""the Beast"", the team creates graphics, pumps out adverts for upcoming events, publishes on multiple social media platforms, and monitors news.
A loyal and growing cohort of ""real people"" churn out social media support for Salvini voluntarily, Morisi said in his presentation, titled ""The Legend of the Captain"", a ubiquitous nickname for Salvini that Morisi coined.
""There's a community that was built up over time, piece by piece, brick by brick, that today is very strong,"" he told the workshop for aspiring political communications professionals. 
Morisi avoids the limelight and rarely speaks to the media. A Reuters reporter was allowed to attend his closed-door talk and take part in a question-and-answer session afterwards - the only reporter there - but Morisi declined to be interviewed separately. 
   
THE BRAND
The machine started up in earnest in January 2014, less than a month after Salvini took the reins of a party polling around 3 percent and plagued by corruption scandals, Morisi said.
Morisi set aside party references and made Salvini - a folksy, 45-year-old politician with a reputation for plain speaking - the brand.
Now the League polls as high as 34 percent, better than its 5-Star Movement coalition partner. In September, Salvini's Facebook page had 28 million unique views, and Morisi said it has recently reached as high as 30 million.
Like Trump, Salvini doesn't shy away from controversy that sparks debate and more traffic. ""The more they call us racists, the closer we get to 51 percent,"" he said in a Facebook video on Sept. 25.
""The secret of Salvini's communication is Salvini himself, together with a team of people who have worked with him for a long time, which plans and amplifies the message,"" Morisi said.
Chubby and bearded, Salvini invites people into his world, posting pictures of the reality TV show he's watching - ""Temptation Island VIP"", for example - or, at 11:30 p.m., the chestnuts he's roasted as a snack.  
""How much I like chestnuts!!!"", he wrote on Oct. 3. ""Have a nice evening friends. You can count on me."" 
""These posts are very important because they create a direct relationship with people, and they help distinguish Salvini from the unpopular caste of politicians,"" Morisi said.
The personal posts are mixed in with automated plugs for his radio or TV appearances, or with news. Then there are the Facebook Live videos, including one from the roof of parliament - ""the only place in the building where we could find a 4G connection,"" Morisi said - where Salvini attacked the ""eurocrats"" in Brussels.
Together with France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen, Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban and others, Salvini aims to overthrow the European Union's liberal establishment and restore power to nation states, an agenda many see as a threat to European unity.
When he was placed under investigation for kidnapping after refusing to allow migrants to disembark from an Italian coast guard ship, Salvini went live on Facebook from his interior ministry office to open the court order.
Where other Italian politicians might squirm with embarrassment, Salvini acted like the investigation was a medal of honor, with his audience as happy accomplices. 
""It is you who asked this minister to control the borders, to control the ports, to limit arrivals, to limit the departure of illegal migrants,"" he told his viewers.    
    
SOUFFLE
To keep people's attention on the Internet, you need graphic variety - different type cases, emoticons and bullets in text - consistency of narrative voice, accuracy in spelling and grammar, brevity and speed, Morisi said.
""One day on social media is like a week in the pre-social media era,"" he said. He aims to publish a post every two hours to announce that ""the bar is open"". 
""If you leave a page even only a few hours without new content, it sags like a souffle,"" he said.
To amplify Salvini's message before the March general election, Morisi created a contest: the fastest person to ""like"" Salvini's posts each day would get their picture on his page. The top four clickers during the three-week game won a coffee and a selfie with their ""captain"". Some 50,000 people signed up. 
Any spike in numbers is amplified by Facebook's algorithm, he said.
Morisi denied reports by La Stampa newspaper and others that the ""Beast"" software picks up on the mood of the online audience at any given moment to hone Salvini's message.

""There's no algorithm that suggests to us or to Salvini what should be talked about,"" he said. ""An expert communicator with years and years of experience doesn't need an algorithm that tells him to take a picture of chestnuts.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - South Korea's president spoke of ""heart-warming"" moves toward peace on the Korean peninsula on Wednesday, a day before he is expected to relay an invitation to Pope Francis to visit North Korea.
Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the number two in the Vatican, said a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for President Moon Jae-in and others, including U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Callista Gingrich and hundreds of Korean residents in Rome.
After the ""Mass for Peace on Korean Peninsula,"" Moon spoke to the congregation of recent positive meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""Right now on the Korean peninsula, historic and heart-warming changes are taking place,"" said Moon, who is Catholic. ""We are blazing the trail of a noble endeavor to secure peace.""
The two Koreas have held three summits this year. Kim also held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, and promised to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Moon meets the pope at midday on Thursday and is expected to pass on an invitation from Kim.
Kim told Moon of his wish to meet the pontiff during a meeting last month, South Korea's presidential office said last week. [L4N1WP2AI] The pope is expected to visit Japan next year.
In his homily at the Mass, Parolin prayed for peace on the Korean peninsula. Peace, he said, had to be built on ""a serious commitment to justice and solidarity, upon the promotion of the rights and dignity of the human person.""
North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as long as it does not undermine the state. But beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship, no open religious activity is allowed.
North Korea, which Church officials estimated had a Catholic community of about 55,000 just before the 1950-53 Korean War, does not allow priests to be permanently stationed there.
Information about how many Catholics are still in North Korea is scarce. Religious agencies have said they number from the few hundreds to about 4,000.
The Church estimates that 11 percent of the South's population are Catholics.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:43AM ET</span>",In training with Poland's volunteer militia,"By Justyna Pawlak and Kacper Pempel
SIEDLCE, Poland (Reuters) - As Poland prepares to mark the centenary of its independence this November, thousands of Poles are training in all weathers for a part-time force meant to help defend the eastern European state from invasion. 
More than 12,000 volunteers have joined the Territorial Defence Forces (WOT), as well as more than 2,000 professional soldiers. The government expects to add 10,000 recruits annually, to reach a total of more than 50,000 by the end of 2021. This year alone, the defence ministry plans to spend 568 million zloty ($153 million) on WOT, nearly as much as on the navy.
The Territorial Defence Forces forces are modeled on America's National Guard, and are prepared to die for their country: In its mission statement, the formation says the biggest benefit for the nation and for recruits will be its ""contribution to national security and the strengthening of patriotic values through the practical dimension of sacrifice for Poland.""
Damian Krasnodebski, a 27-year old architect from Warsaw who joined last year, says the force will provide guerrilla fighters to help deter potential attackers, particularly Russia. Poland joined the NATO Western military alliance in 1999, but he believes NATO is not enough.
""A guerrilla force is always difficult to fight against,"" he told Reuters. ""If there was fighting in Poland, there would be problems with supply lines, subversive activity. That's always difficult for the opposing military.""
Most Poles perceive their main threat to be from Russia, which has built up significant conventional forces along its western borders after annexing the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Opinion polls show that since then, nearly half the people in Poland feel their country's independence may be under threat.
ANXIOUS
The WOT formation's creators also hope it will have clear resonance with a Home Army that fought against occupation in World War Two, and with later resistance fighters against Communism. 
Monika Pawlik, a 24-year-old town clerk and young mother, was one of four women at a training session last winter. ""I wanted to try something new, and above all I wanted to have this sense of security,"" she said. Now she feels confident about handling weapons: ""I know what to do with them, I know how to aim.""
Poles are not the only people in the region who are anxious about Moscow. Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - all bordering Russia - have sharply raised their defence budgets in recent years. They are among the few NATO allies that meet, or are close to meeting, the alliance's target of spending 2 percent of economic output on the military. 
Finland, not a NATO member but also a European nation bordering Russia, plans to boost its army with 50,000 troops to 280,000. As of this year, it is spending additional 55 million euros ($64 million) a year to improve the army's combat capabilities, including army reservists.
PATRIOTISM
Poland's military planners launched WOT in 2017, just over a year after the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in October 2015. Its creator, Antoni Macierewicz, who was defence minister at the time, argued the formation was needed because of a growing threat from Russia and as a way to bolster patriotism among young people.
Macierewicz said Poland took its operational example from the United States, where the National Guard reserve military force is made up mostly of civilians with part-time military duties. ""We have consulted repeatedly with Guard officers,"" Macierewicz told public broadcaster TVP Info in 2016.
So far, Poland's WOT force has only participated in one major effort: a search through forests in parts of Poland for animals that died because of African swine fever. It's a highly contagious disease that affects pigs and wild boar and has been spreading in eastern Europe in recent years. 
Young people who join are expected to spend at least four months in training over three years, including 16 days in basic training in battlefield readiness, marksmanship, topography and first aid. Any holiday trips need to be cleared with a local unit commander. In return, recruits receive a 300 zloty ($80) monthly stipend as well as education and training allowances.
Marcin Wierzbicki, a 44-year-old manager in an energy company, says that by joining WOT he is following in the family tradition set by his grandfathers of defending Poland. He does not expect to take part in battles, but to support the operative army, guard key assets, control road points and so on.
""Poland will be safer now and in the future,"" he said.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",India looks to tighten sexual harassment laws: government officials,"By Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering tightening sexual harassment laws, government officials said on Thursday, after an avalanche of complaints of abuse lodged by women in recent weeks thrust the issue to the forefront of politics.
Changes to the laws are being considered as the government weighs different proposals to tackle harassment, one of the officials said.
""The official announcement could come next week,"" said the official, who works in the prime minister's office.
The officials declined to give any details about possible changes.
The government focus on the law has come after women's rights groups complained that the existing laws do not go far enough to address the widespread problem of sexual harassment.
A junior government minister resigned on Wednesday after he faced sexual harassment accusations from more than a dozen women. 
The allegations related to when the junior foreign minister, M.J. Akbar, was a top newspaper editor. He is the biggest casualty since the #MeToo movement in India gained traction in recent weeks. 
Akbar has denied wrongdoing and said he was stepping down so that he could fight the allegations in court. 
A Delhi court began proceedings on Thursday in a defamation suit filed by Akbar against one of the women who leveled accusations against him. The next hearing will be on Oct. 31.
The previous government passed a workplace harassment act and an act to amend criminal law in 2013. The latter made sexual harassment, stalking and voyeurism crimes.
But women's groups say a requirement that accusations be made to a workplace complaints committee within three months is unfair as some women can not quickly muster the courage to take that step.
The government should review certain provisions of the sexual harassment prevention law, said Rebecca John, a lawyer who is defending the woman against whom Akbhar has filed a defamation suit.
""The provision of filing a complaint within three months should be made more flexible,"" she said.
In the case of many of the recent complaints against journalists, actors and other public figures, many of which were made under the #MeToo hashtag on social media, the accusations related to incidents that happened years ago.
Women's groups also say that the law doesn't make clear who in a workplace is in charge of ensuring compliance and is therefore responsible if its provisions are not followed. 

The workplace law also only requires an organization employing more than 10 people to set up an internal complaints committee to hear and redress sexual harassment grievances, but critics say many companies don't do that.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Election thumping on the cards for Merkel coalition parties: poll,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) both face a drubbing in a regional election on Oct. 28 that risks further weakening their crisis-prone national government, a poll showed on Thursday.
The drop in support for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) to just 26 percent comes after their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), suffered its weakest election performance since 1950 in a state vote on Sunday.
Poor back-to-back results for Merkel's conservative alliance would weaken her before a CDU party conclave that is followed by the party's annual congress in early December. If she does not emerge well from those events, her opponents will be emboldened.
The survey by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for broadcaster ZDF showed support for the CDU sinking by several points from other recent polls ahead of the Oct. 28 vote in the western state of Hesse, home to financial center Frankfurt.
The poll reading of 26 percent is also far below the 38.3 percent the CDU won at the last state election in Hesse in 2013, after which it formed a coalition with the ecologist Greens.
The poll showed support for the SPD falling to 20 percent - far below its result of 30.7 percent in 2013. The CDU and SPD would also lack a majority with which to rule.
The Greens will be the big winner in Hesse, the poll showed, jumping into second place with 22 percent support. However, support for the incumbent alliance of CDU and Greens was equal to that of the other parties, so they may need a third partner.
A so-called 'Jamaica' coalition of the CDU, Greens and FDP - whose colors match the Jamaican national flag - would be one option. Support for the FDP, and the far-left Linke, was at 8 percent each, the poll showed.
Negotiations on forming a Jamaica government at the national level collapsed earlier this year, forcing Merkel's conservatives and the SPD to renew their ruling coalition - a loveless alliance that had been plagued by infighting.
After the Bavaria election debacle, Merkel vowed to restore trust in her government. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said ""something has to change"" in the ruling coalition. 
Support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which hailed the Bavaria result as ""an earthquake"" that would rock the ruling coalition, was broadly steady in Hesse at 12 percent, the poll showed.
Forschungsgruppe Wahlen surveyed 1,035 voters in Hesse from Monday to Wednesday.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Former Malaysian deputy PM detained amid graft investigation,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency arrested a former deputy prime minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, on Thursday in connection with an investigation into suspected misappropriation of funds from a charity foundation, the agency said.
Ahmad Zahid leads the opposition as the president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the once-powerful party that ruled Malaysia for 60 years before being ousted in a shock general election defeat in May.
He is the latest former high-ranking official to be arrested over suspected graft since the election.
Ex-premier Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, face multiple charges in connection with a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Najib has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to 32 criminal charges involving more than 2.3 billion ringgit ($553.6 million) allegedly siphoned from 1MDB.
Rosmah has pleaded not guilty to 17 money-laundering offences.
Ahmad Zahid was arrested following an investigation into alleged ""abuse of power, breach of trust, and money laundering"", the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said in a statement.
He will be brought to a Kuala Lumpur court on Friday to face several charges under anti-corruption and money laundering laws, the MACC said. 
According to media, Ahmad Zahid was accused of using funds from his family-run charity foundation to pay off credit card bills for himself and his wife.
He has denied wrongdoing. He says the payments were made in error by an aide and that he has since repaid the amount.
Authorities have frozen hundreds of bank accounts and blocked several people from leaving the country, as anti-graft agents ramp up a wide-ranging inquiry into how billions of dollars allegedly went missing from state coffers.
In June, the MACC said it had frozen several accounts linked to UMNO as part of their investigations into 1MDB.

U.S. authorities say more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, and nearly $700 million from the fund was diverted into Najib's personal bank accounts.

NILAKKAL, India (Reuters) - Conservative Hindu groups including youth members of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party returned to an Indian hill temple on Thursday to block women from entering for a second day, in defiance of a court ruling that says banning them is illegal.
For centuries, the Sabarimala temple in Kerala state has banned women and girls between the ages of 10 and 50 from entering the holy site. But last month, India's Supreme Court ruled the ban infringed on the right to worship.
Since then, the case has become a focal point for women's rights in India.
There were clashes between police and protesters when the temple opened for the first time since the ban was lifted on Wednesday, preventing women from entering.
Kerala's secular state government says it wants to uphold the court's decision, but Hindu groups, including branches of the BJP and its parent organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, say the court's decision is offensive to worshippers.
""A large number of women, who follow the tradition, were not heard; their emotions weren't respected,"" RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat told a rally of supporters on Thursday.
In response, the state's chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a tweet that the RSS and other Hindu groups ""are obstructing believers and spreading terror"".
LAW FLOUTED 
The temple is located in a remote tiger reserve in the western Ghats mountain range. Many visitors trek through the mountains to get to the temple.
Kerala's police department has imposed an emergency law until midnight on Friday preventing groups of four or more people from gathering within 30 km (19 miles) of the temple.
A police official, who declined to be identified, said seven members of a youth wing of the BJP were arrested on Thursday after disguising themselves as worshippers and staging a sit-in at Nilakkal, about 18 km (11 miles) from the temple and the main entry point to the site.

On Thursday, a female reporter from the New York Times was pelted with stones while trying to visit the temple. The journalist, Suhasini Raj, abandoned her trip under police protection, footage from Reuters partner ANI showed.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will discuss on Thursday how to make the euro zone more resilient to crises, with the bloc's third biggest economy, Italy, putting new urgency into the talks by challenging EU budget rules that underpin the single currency.
Leaders of all EU countries except Britain are to take stock of progress in completing the euro zone's banking union and granting new powers to its ESM bailout fund as the 19 countries sharing the euro prepare for decisions to be taken in December. 
""We are ... looking for some guidance from leaders on topics like the fiscal capacity,"" Mario Centeno, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, told reporters on entering the summit.
""I see growing interest in some member states in specific issues related to the fiscal capacity, for example the unemployment reinsurance system,"" he said.
The reforms under consideration so far are to ensure that the euro zone would have enough money in case of a major banking crisis to resolve failing banks and to prevent bank runs by setting up a euro zone-wide deposit guarantee scheme.
The ESM is to get new powers of regularly monitoring economies so that it could be ready at a moment's notice to step in with a full bailout program of reforms in exchange for cheap loans if a sovereign were cut off from markets, possibly after managing a debt restructuring if necessary.
The fund is also to have the possibility of lending with minimal conditions to euro zone governments that have been conducting sound economic policy, but were hit by external crises not of their own making.
ITALY MAKES EURO ZONE REFORM MORE DIFFICULT
But all these discussions, controversial from the start because they involve sharing financial risks, have now been made much more difficult by Italy, where a populist government wants to finance higher spending and lower taxes with more borrowing.
Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger another debt crisis like the one set of by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone.
""I am absolutely aware that the atmosphere is more tricky than in June,"" the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk said this week when asked how Italy's fiscal plans would affect deeper euro zone integration agreed on at a summit in June.
""But I think we can use the time before December to clarify the position of some member states and our goal remains to have visible progress in December,"" Tusk said.
Privately, euro zone officials acknowledge that Rome's plans only strengthened the opposition from those skeptical about financial risk sharing.
""It is going to be more difficult now. At the moment when you talk about deposit insurance the appetite for it is smaller,"" one official involved in the talks said.
""Italy is now an additional argument not to even think about it. And Germany, the Netherlands who have always said it is not needed at all, of course they have now one argument more,"" he said.
Officials also worry that Italy may link its support for whatever ideas are in the end agreed in the euro zone integration process, with the EU's consent for its higher borrowing in the 2019 budget.
Under EU rules, highly indebted countries like Italy should cut their deficit and debt every year, but Rome argues that the higher borrowing would spur faster economic growth and debt would fall as percentage of GDP in the end.
The Commission rejects this, noting the resulting growth would have to be very high for the argument to hold and that borrowing more to reduce debt was not the way to go.
""If the confrontation intensifies, Italy can block any consensus at the summit. That is a real risk,"" one official said. ""That would not be the end of Europe, but it would be disappointing because of all the work that has gone into this.""

907,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Party of Brazil's Bolsonaro open to centrist leadership of Congress,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The party of Brazil's far-right presidential candidate, which made huge strides in legislative races this month, appears willing to accept congressional leaders from centrist parties as it seeks to build goodwill to pass tough legislation.
Jair Bolsonaro won 46 percent of votes on Oct. 7, forcing him into an Oct. 28 run-off against leftist rival Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party. With a growing lead in opinion polls, Bolsonaro believes the presidency is ""within reach."" 
The former army captain's strong showing also lifted his party, the once-tiny Social Liberal Party (PSL), into the upper echelons of Brazil's political firmament, making it easier for him and congressional allies to pass laws to ease gun control and open up the economy.
In the wake of the first-round vote, the PSL's founder, federal congressman Luciano Bivar, had suggested that the party's impressive electoral performance gave it license to seek the leadership of the lower house. 
But those views appear to have softened, with party leaders now open to allowing centrist lawmakers to take the top jobs in both houses. If enacted, that stance could pave the way for a more harmonious coalition and ease the passing of potentially thorny legislation. 
Gustavo Bebianno, the PSL president, said on Wednesday that it would be ""anti-strategic"" and an ""inadequate concentration of power"" to keep the lower house leadership in PSL hands, according to quotes published on the news website G1.
""We're 100 percent willing to negotiate the leadership of the lower house with other parties,"" Bebianno was quoted as saying. ""Nobody is thinking about an authoritarian government.""
The PSL won 52 seats in the lower house, trailing the Workers Party, which won 56. Bolsonaro's strong views on family values, the importance of the powerful agricultural sector and apparent willingness to liberalize the economy will likely help him build a broad coalition on the right. 
In the Senate, where the PSL did less well, Simone Tebet, of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party, is increasingly being mentioned as a potential leader, according to a source with knowledge of discussions. Bolsonaro is also broadly in favor of her, according to a campaign source. 
Bolsonaro, who has cut back campaigning as he recovers from a stab wound, ordered his team to step back from the limelight to avoid making public declarations that could hurt him, campaign sources told Reuters.
On Wednesday, he did not answer a question on whether he would attend presidential debates, in which he has tripped up under tough questioning in the past.
A 63-year-old, seven-term congressman, Bolsonaro has successfully pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate, appealing to voters fed up with political graft and violent crime.
He has run an unorthodox campaign, relying on social media and grass roots rallies that have won him legions of fans who delight at his sharp words and Twitter putdowns.

Nonetheless, opinion polls show he is also widely disliked by many in the electorate who have been alienated by years of his misogynist, racist and homophobic comments.

The statement was the third such call and followed a similar message on Wednesday telling teachers not to participate as election workers in polling stations, many of which are located in schools.
It said the elections ""have no Islamic or Afghan essence but are a foreign plot to prolong occupation"" and said it was the duty of every Afghan and Muslim to oppose them.
""Consequently, preachers and prayer leaders must inform their constituency, while tribal leaders and influential figures must prevent participation by the public,"" the statement said.
The elections for the lower house of parliament are due to take place on Saturday but preparations have been dogged by chaotic organization and allegations of widespread fraud as well as worries that polling stations will be attacked.
Thousands of police and soldiers have been deployed across the country to ensure security but already nine candidates have been assassinated and hundreds of people have been killed and wounded in election-related attacks. 
Although the Taliban say they will not deliberately target civilians, security officials say attacks are likely on Saturday morning to deter voters from going to polling stations.
The Taliban's strong opposition to the vote comes against a backdrop of contacts with U.S. officials over possible talks to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan, with both sides attempting to secure the upper hand before any formal negotiations begin.
The elections, which have been repeatedly delayed, are seen as a key credibility test for Afghanistan's democratic institutions but with two days left until the vote, officials were still rushing to complete preparations.
Untested biometric voter registration equipment introduced at the last minute at the demand of political parties was still being sent out and set up in remote provincial voting centers and it was unclear whether it would be ready in time.
Some 8.8 million names have been registered but millions of these are believed to be fraudulently recorded and the real number of likely voters is unknown.
The lower house of parliament, with 249 seats and an extra seat reserved for the small Sikh community, has little power but the elections are seen as a vital step before more important presidential elections in April next year.

District council elections, which were due to be held alongside the parliamentary elections, have been abandoned and in Ghazni province voting will be delayed because of arguments over the representation of different ethnic groups.

SEOUL (Reuters) - More than 1.5 million people, among them ""tens of thousands"" of foreigners, have attended North Korea's new mass performances, state media said on Thursday, adding that the spectacle would be extended due to popular demand.
The ""Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic Performance 'The Glorious Country'"" was launched with much fanfare by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on September 9 with hundreds of international media and dignitaries in attendance.
North Korea’s first Mass Games in five years have provided a chance for Kim to raise foreign currency at a time when tourism remains one of the few remaining reliable sources of income amid tough U.N. sanctions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
By the middle of October, at least 1.53 million people had attended the performances, Vice-Minister of Culture Ri Sun Chol told the state-run KCNA news agency.
""It is sparking off another round of stormy enthusiasm,"" Ri said, with KCNA reporting the games had created ""a regular furor among people"". 
Citing high demand, Ri said the performances would be extended, without specifying how long they would last.
Western tour companies have said on social media that the games would last until at least the end of October.
The performances have been criticized by rights groups as tantamount to forced child labor, and testimonies collected by defector groups describe harsh training regimes.
The September premiere at a stadium North Korea says can hold 150,000 featured new high-tech displays by glowing drone formations, lasers, and light projections.
Thousands of dancers, gymnasts, martial artists and singers acted out scenes addressing familiar themes from North Korean propaganda.
In mid-September, the games were also the venue for an unprecedented speech by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who was visiting Pyongyang for a summit with Kim.
Unlike some past shows, the new imagery largely left out any anti-American themes or displays of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles, and instead showed scenes highlighting Kim’s diplomatic campaign and plans for economic development.

Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged at a landmark summit in Singapore in June to work towards denuclearization. But the agreement was short on specifics and talks have made little headway since.

Opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won a surprise presidential election victory on Sept. 23 and Yameen is due to hand over power on Nov. 17, even though he had petitioned the Supreme Court challenging his election defeat.
Yameen said on Wednesday he was preparing to step down.
The chairman of Solih's Maldives Democratic Party, Hassan Latheef, said Yameen would face inquiries related to the suspected misappropriation of funds at a state-owned agency that promotes the leasing of islands for resort development, in the first of several cases.
""A travel ban against President Yameen must be instituted. There are several cases pending investigation including cases of corruption,"" he told reporters after filing a petition before the police.
A police spokesman declined to comment, saying it was not the practice to say anything on such pending matters.
Yameen said in a speech on Wednesday he had done nothing wrong and had acted in the best interests of the country during his term as president.
The Maldives, a string of palm-fringed islands and atolls 325 miles (523 km) southwest of the southern tip of India, is best known as a luxury holiday destination.
But the Muslim nation of less than half a million people has suffered a turbulent transition to democracy following the end of three decades of authoritarian rule in 2008.
Its latest phase of turmoil began in February when Yameen imposed a state of emergency and several ministers and judges were detained on charges ranging from corruption to terrorism.
The islands have become more significant in recent years for both China and India as they seek to extend their influence over important Indian Ocean shipping lanes. 
Solih had won the election on the promise of cleaning up corruption and would pursue cases vigorously, Latheef said.

Draghi's job will become available at the end of next October. By that time Nowotny - the head of the Austrian National Bank and a moderate policy hawk who has often sided with Weidmann - will have left his post too.
""I would have welcomed a candidacy of Weidmann very much,"" Nowotny told the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper."" I personally believe it is a grave political mistake by (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel that she is no longer pursuing Weidmann's candidacy further.""
Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau is now considered the frontrunner in the race but no real discussion is likely until after the European Parliament elections next spring, when the ECB job is expected to be decided in a package that also includes the heads of the EU Commission and Council.
Despite the political sensitivity of the race, Weidmann has been outspoken in criticizing the fiscal plans of Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy. He said on Wednesday that monetary policy normalization will place an increasing burden on highly indebted countries so there is no place for leniency with Rome on European fiscal rules.
His repeated spats with Italy over fiscal prudence has irritated political circles in Rome, making opposition to Weidmann's candidacy almost certain.
Weidmann, a top notch economist, has also come under fire for his persistent opposition to the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program. 
Unveiled during a period of crisis, the program is credited with reviving growth, and some argue that Weidmann would struggle to unite the Governing Council after having opposed its hallmark policy program for so long. 

""It would be good if someone from the biggest economy in the euro area stood at the top of the ECB,"" Nowotny told the paper, adding that an ECB president needs political sensitivity and practical experience as well as being a good economist.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Football, funfairs and fortunes: In Afghan election, money talks","By Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Javid Jaihoon, who started life selling water on the streets of Kabul, is one of a clutch of Afghan businessmen whose multimillion dollar fortunes, built in the boom years after the fall of the Taliban, are now fuelling a run for parliament.
As well as featuring prominently among the riot of campaign posters now plastering the streets ahead of Saturday's election, they are burnishing their image with TV ads, football team sponsorships or treats like free admission to amusement parks.
""It's not suits that make you different,"" the shaven-headed Jaihoon, known widely as ""Lala"" (""Brother"") Javid, told Reuters, lightly brushing his own Armani jacket. ""'Lala Javid' himself is a brand that's known all over the country.""
After a childhood selling cups of water and loose bananas, Jaihoon was among a class of entrepreneurs agile and ruthless enough to seize their chance during the wild decade after 2001 when Western money and contracts were pouring into Afghanistan with few questions asked.
Now worth $200 million, according to his own estimate, Jaihoon owns Afghanistan's largest cement factory, a bank and a security company that together employ more than 8,000 people.
""Anyone can become a millionaire if they work hard and believe in achieving something,"" he said.
Even as the Taliban have extended their reach from their rural heartlands to the outskirts of major cities like Kabul, money is being made in Afghanistan and the rise of such entrepreneurs underlines its undoubted power in local politics.
While often closely linked to the political elite, they represent a change from the old class of former Mujahideen leaders and strongmen, several of whom have children running for parliament.
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
The sons of Hizb-i Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and former anti-Soviet commanders Ismail Khan, Mohammad Moheqeq and Karim Khalili, are all standing, using the aura of their family name to power their campaigns.
All are considered likely to win seats and continue the dynasties created by their fathers in the turbulent years that began with the assassination of former President Daud Khan and the arrival of the Soviets in the late 1970s. 
But for many in the new business class, the election is less a matter of political power than protecting their interests. 
""As a businessman, you basically have to pay and fill the pockets of a lot of people if you get a contract,"" said Habibullah Esmati, a candidate who owns a popular fun park near Kabul zoo. ""But if I am elected to parliament, I will be immune from paying protection money. It will be an insurance for my businesses and investment.""
Critics say that for those with money and connections, a seat in parliament offers excellent opportunities to win lucrative government contracts together with protection against prosecution. There is a great incentive to buy votes either directly or through promises and favors and campaign spending limits appear to be openly flouted.
""In Afghanistan, the first criterion for voters is money, then ethnic and family connections,"" said Naeem Ayubzada, director of the Transparent Election Foundation Afghanistan, a watchdog body. He said one female candidate, without the means of some rivals, had come to his office in tears because people were demanding $50 for their vote.
""I DON'T NEED MONEY""
But like many businessmen-turned-politicians in Western countries, Afghan entrepreneurs typically promise that their wealth will enable them to resist the corruption for which parliament has become notorious.
""My election slogan is 'Fight against poverty and unemployment'. But to support youth and provide them with jobs, I have to be in parliament,"" Jaihoon said.
""I am not like other MPs who think being in parliament is a lucrative business. I don't need money and I won't go to the ministers to get something done. I will summon them and make sure they do their jobs,"" he said.
A former football player, he also sponsors a team in Afghanistan's Premier League, a well-tried formula for boosting popularity.
The league was itself rescued from financial problems last month by another wealthy entrepreneur-turned-candidate called Ajmal Rahmani, known popularly as ""Armoured Ajmal"" after his business selling bulletproof cars to the Kabul elite.
Rahmani's campaign posters now adorn the grounds where spectators on match day get gift bags bearing his image, an updated version of the traditional feasts and hospitality Afghan politicians offer at meetings with their supporters.
Esmati, who opened up his funfair to the public during the campaign, tempting almost 10,000 potential voters with a free day out, also sees the value of innovative approaches to garnering support.

""Other MPs had feasts and feeding people,"" he said. ""But I gave them entertainment and I believe entertainment is more important than food.""

Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has been negotiating with Lebanon's rival parties since a parliamentary election in May to form a new power-sharing cabinet, but they have so far been unable to reach consensus.
Asked by reporters on Thursday if a government would be agreed on, President Michel Aoun replied: ""Yes, the government will be very soon or sooner."" 
The major parties have jostled over the number of cabinet seats they should get and over the apportionment of the most powerful ministries. In recent days stepped-up talks between leaders have increased optimism that the deadlock may soon be broken. 
""Forming the government is taking longer than expected but we will get there,"" Hariri said on Tuesday.
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri is expected to return to Lebanon from a trip abroad on Friday. 
The delay has increased concern over the threat of an economic crisis in the heavily-indebted country. Lebanon has the third largest debt-to-GDP ratio in the world at more than 150 percent, and a new government is expected to start moves toward bringing down the deficit.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will seek Asian support for free trade, the Iran nuclear deal and combating global warming at a regional summit on Thursday that includes China, Japan and Russia as a counterbalance to a more protectionist United States.
Leaders from the European Union, Switzerland and Norway will welcome 21 Asian counterparts including China's Premier Li Keqiang after an EU summit dominated by negotiations over Britain's departure from the world's biggest trading bloc.
The 51 gathered leaders are set to show ""strong support"" for the World Trade Organisation that U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to quit, and express ""profound alarm"" about climate change, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters.
Leaders representing 55 percent of global trade will underline ""their joint commitment to open, free and non-discriminatory trade"" and ""to fight all forms of protectionism"", according to the draft.
Trump says the United States is treated badly in global trade and has blamed the WTO for allowing that to happen. Separately, the United States and China have imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on each other's goods while Trump has also complained about an unfair EU trade surplus with Washington.
""This is a message that the European Union is more than Brexit and that Europe has friends beyond Washington,"" said a senior EU official involved in preparing the summit, which has taken place every two years since 1996.
On Friday, the EU will sign a free-trade deal with Singapore. The bloc is also pushing for approval for another free-trade agreement with Vietnam.
However, the European Union is trying not to side with China against the United States. On Tuesday, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Brussels on improving trade ties, although Washington accused the bloc of moving too slowly in negotiations.
FROM STEEL TO CYBER ATTACKS
The EU-Asia summit meeting will also pressure Beijing to combat what Europe says is China's harmful overproduction of steel and the final statement is set to say that leaders agreed to tackle ""excess capacity in industrial sectors"", according to the draft, which could still be modified by diplomats.
China, which produces and consumes half the world's steel and, has cut some 220 million tonnes of capacity since January 2016. But the European Union remains intent on pressuring China to cut more, as well as to remove subsidies - a policy that the West says is aimed at dominating global markets.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to discuss subsidies with Li at a lunch on Friday, diplomats said.
Bolstering the Iran nuclear deal signed by global powers in 2016, and that Trump has withdrawn from, is also another priority of the summit. 
Leaders will call on North Korea to ""completely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle all its nuclear and weapons of mass destruction"", according to the draft final statement.
Leaders will re-commit to the Paris climate pact that Trump pulled out of, pledging to develop more clean energy.
Another sensitive issue is wording in the final communique on cyber attacks and stopping computer hackers. 
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev will attend the summit but it is not clear if Moscow, accused by the West of a global hacking campaign, will agree to proposed language calling for an end to such attacks.

Russia denies any responsibility for cyber attacks.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore charged a citizen, a North Korean and three companies in court on Thursday with supplying prohibited luxury items to North Korea, the latest example of sanctions breaches in the wealthy Asian city-state.
Police said Chong Hock Yen, 58, and North Korean Li Hyin, 30, were charged with infringing U. N. sanctions regulations that bar the supply, directly or indirectly, of any export or luxury item to any person in North Korea.
Also charged were three Singapore-registered companies linked to Chong - SCN Singapore Pte Ltd, Laurich International Pte Ltd and Sindok Trading Pte Ltd.
""Singapore takes its obligations under the United Nations Security Council resolutions seriously and implements them fully and faithfully,"" the police said in a statement.
""We will not hesitate to take action against any individual or entity that breaches our laws and regulations."" 
Reuters could not immediately reach Chong, Li or officials of the companies to seek comment.
Thursday's news comes after a Singapore company official, Ng Kheng Wah, was charged for supplying luxury goods to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions in July. Ng has yet to be sentenced.
In 2016, Singapore fined a shipping company based in the city state, Chinpo Shipping Company (Private) Ltd, S$180,000 for facilitating a shipment of arms to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions.
The police said investigation showed Chong is believed to have helped three companies supply items such as jewelery and watches with precious metals, to North Korea 43 times between 27 December 2010 and 18 November 2016.
Li is believed to have helped two firms supply similar items to North Korea in 14 instances between 17 September 2014 and 5 January 2017. 
It was unclear if the cases were related. 
Singapore, the site of an unprecedented summit this year between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, says it complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions imposed on the North to persuade it to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Singapore suspended trade relations with North Korea in November last year, when the United Nations toughened sanctions over its weapons program.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",U.S. opposed to Koreas' plan for no-fly zone over border: sources,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States opposes a plan by South and North Korea to set up a no-fly zone over their heavily fortified border, the latest sign of a rift between Seoul and its top ally, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Washington and Seoul both publicly insist they are on the same page about dealing with Pyongyang. But behind the scenes, there are growing signs of disagreement as South and North Korea forge ahead with plans to defuse military tensions and rebuild economic ties. 
The military accord, sealed during last month's summit in Pyongyang, is one of the most concrete agreements between the neighbors this year. But U.S. officials have raised concerns that it could undermine defense readiness and comes without substantial progress on denuclearization. 
The pact includes a halt in ""all hostile acts,"" a no-fly zone around the border and a gradual removal of landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarised Zone. 
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo expressed ""discontent"" with the agreement during a phone call, South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said last week in a rare disclosure of discord between the allies.
The United States was not likely to openly protest against an inter-Korean initiative, Seoul officials said, but its deep involvement in sanctions enforcement and military operations give it leverage to delay or change the policy.
The no-fly zone is a key sticking point for the U.S. because it would effectively prevent close air support drills, the sources said, adding that Pompeo raised the issue during the call with Kang. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
The zone, effective Nov. 1, will extend 40 kilometers north and south from the Military Demarcation Line in the East and 20 kilometers in the West for fixed-wing aircraft. 
The agreement also bars live-fire drills involving fixed-wing aircraft and air-to-ground guided weapons in the no-fly area. South Korea and the United States had held such drills regularly until halting joint exercises in June.
There are different restrictions on helicopters, drones and balloons, with exemptions for commercial and non-military operations such as medical, disaster and agricultural uses.
In close air support, airplanes provide firepower for troops who may be operating near enemy forces. Most fighter jets that U.S. forces operate in South Korea, such as the F-16, can play that role, one of the sources said. 
An official at Seoul's foreign ministry said Pompeo had not been ""fully briefed"" when he complained about the inter-Korean deal, and called back that day to wish Kang good luck with the summit.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan declined to comment on the agreement but said the Department of Defense backs efforts to reduce military tensions. 
The department ""remains in full support of our diplomats as they work to achieve the verified denuclearization of the DPRK as agreed to by Chairman Kim (Jong Un),"" Logan said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
A spokesman at South Korea's defense ministry said Seoul cooperates closely with Washington and the U.S.-led United Nations Command (UNC). 
SIGNS OF DISCORD
South Korea has held more than 50 rounds of talks this year with the UNC, which oversees affairs in the DMZ, to facilitate the inter-Korean commitments but has not yet secured its full support, according to Baek Seung-joo, a lawmaker of the opposition Liberty Korea Party. 
On Tuesday, North and South Korea held their first three-way talks with the UNC to discuss ""practical"" steps to facilitate the military pact, but did not announce any concrete measures, Seoul's defense ministry said. 
""They're not even close to an agreed definition of 'hostile acts'"", said Baek, who served as a vice defense minister in 2013-15. 
""The agreement would make it impossible to carry out air cover and overall exercises, and it would hurt the alliance's reconnaissance capabilities,"" Baek said.
But the UNC is taking a cautious approach so as not to kindle anti-U.S. sentiment among a public supportive of the two Koreas' push for peace, Baek said.
While maintaining that it remains in lockstep with Washington, the administration of South Korea's Moon Jae-in has forged ahead with efforts to engage with the North, even as critics accused Moon of focusing on feel-good theatrics at the expense of progress.
Kim vowed to work toward denuclearization during his unprecedented June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. But Pyongyang's actions have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and materials. 

""The alliance is being undercut for the sake of confidence-building with the North, while there is little progress on the nuclear issue, which is the root cause of the longstanding tensions,"" Baek said.

CHIQUIMULA, Guatemala (Reuters) - More Honduran migrants tried to join a caravan of several thousand trekking through Guatemala on Wednesday, defying calls by authorities not to make the journey after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off regional aid in reprisal.
The caravan has been growing steadily since it left the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Saturday. The migrants hope to reach Mexico and then cross its northern border with the United States, to seek refuge from endemic violence and poverty in Central America.
Several thousand people are now journeying in the caravan, according to a Reuters witness traveling with the group in Guatemala, where men, women and children on foot or riding in trucks filled a road on their long journey to Mexico.
A first group made it to Guatemala City by dusk on Wednesday. They crammed into a migrant shelter and a primary school across the road and bedded down on inflatable mattresses.
""My husband was an electrician. They killed him nine months ago,"" said Carolina Aguilar, 40, from the gang-controlled town of Choloma, sitting on a patch of ground with her two daughters, 17 and 11.
""We don't have a house and I have no job. We only manage to live from gifts,"" she said.
Many had hitched rides or walked about 150 miles (241 km)from the Honduran border.
""We've lived in neighborhoods where our children have seen disaster after disaster,"" said Daisy Turcios, at an earlier stop on the road. ""We have seen dead bodies thrown in front of us. So that's my goal, in truth, to reach a country where life can change for my children.""
Nearby, kneeling in the dirt, Abigail Castro kissed her small son and wrapped her most precious documents into a plastic bag, waterproofing them against uncertain conditions ahead.
""Whatever money I have, I need it to buy drinks for my son, fruit,"" she said. Some friendly Guatemalans had offered transport in pickup trucks or cars, she said, but ""everyone wants to get on"" so they would have to go by foot.
THREAT TO FOREIGN AID
Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said on Wednesday his government rejected constraints placed on foreign aid. 
""No help can be conditioned and no help can be demanded,"" Morales told reporters in the Guatemalan capital.
He said he had spoken with his Honduran counterpart, President Juan Orlando Hernandez, about ensuring that those migrants who want to return home can do so safely, and cited reports indicating that many people from the caravan are returning to Honduras.
President Trump decried ""horrendous weak and outdated immigration laws,"" in a series of Twitter messages starting on Tuesday. He threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if they fail to prevent undocumented immigrants from heading to the United States.
""Hard to believe that with thousands of people from South of the Border, walking unimpeded toward our country in the form of large Caravans, that the Democrats won't approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country,"" Trump said on Twitter on Wednesday.
The Honduran government has urged citizens not to join the caravan, calling it politically motivated. On Wednesday morning near the Guatemalan border, authorities could be seen stopping Hondurans still hoping to join, with police in riot gear at one checkpoint halting buses carrying at least a hundred people.
The men, women and children carried on toward the border on foot, Reuters photographs showed, with some later fording a jungle river near the frontier after unconfirmed reports that Guatemalan authorities had stopped letting Hondurans enter the country.
Guatemalan authorities did not provide an estimate of the size of the caravan, which aims to pass through Guatemala City before heading to Mexico.
Adult citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua need only present national identity cards to cross each others' borders. That regional immigration agreement does not apply when they reach Mexico.
Mexico said anyone who enters the country with a Mexican visa can move freely, while those without proper documents would be subject to review and could be deported.

""This measure responds not only to compliance with national legislation, but particularly to the interest of the Mexican Government to avoid that such people become victims of human trafficking networks,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Lawyers for Brazil's President Michel Temer on Wednesday asked the country's top court to annul a federal police report that recommended he and his close associates be charged with graft and have their assets confiscated.
Police have been investigating Temer for allegedly taking bribes in return for helping shape a decree regulating Brazil's ports, and in particular for extending concessions in the port of Santos to benefit companies of close associates.
Temer, who took office in 2016 after former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, has repeatedly said he is innocent. He has faced several graft allegations, but is immune from prosecution while in office, unless the Supreme Court decides to strip his immunity.
Temer's defense team argued that the federal police should not be able to charge Temer without the authorization of the Supreme Court or the public prosecutors office.
The federal police report, which was seen by Reuters on Tuesday, recommended that Temer, his daughter Maristela, his former adviser Rodrigo Rocha Loures and eight others face charges and have their assets confiscated for their role in allegedly laundering bribes through real estate transactions.
Carlos Marun, Brazil's minister of government, said on Wednesday that Temer was ""outraged and shaken"" by the police report. 
Supreme Court Justice Luis Roberto Barroso, who is overseeing the case, said on Tuesday he would wait to see the findings of Brazil's public prosecutors office before deciding on how to proceed.
Temer's term ends on Jan. 1, and with it his immunity from prosecution.

Congress voted twice last year to block Temer from standing trial in the Supreme Court on three corruption charges leveled against him.

A report by Haiti's Senate accused former government officials of embezzlement, abuse of authority and forgery involving the Venezuelan Petrocaribe oil loan program during the 2008-16 administrations of former presidents Rene Preval and Michel Martelly.
Moise, in a speech on Wednesday to mark the 1806 death of Haiti's founder, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, pledged that a trial would be held to get to the bottom of missing Petrocaribe funds.
""Once you have stolen government funds, whether you are part of the government, of the opposition or of the population, you'll have to face justice,"" Moise said in his remarks in the northern town of Marchand Dessalines.
Opposition leaders have said they do not believe a fair trial is possible while Moise remains in power because of his ties to Martelly.
Protesters erected flaming barricades made of tires and piles of garbage, while shots rang out across the capital, Port-au-Prince. Police fired tear gas at some demonstrators, and in response, some hurled rocks back at them.
Riot police could also be seen standing guard at several businesses in the capital's upscale Petion-Ville area.
One man was killed in downtown Port-au-Prince amid several violent incidents there and in other cities, police said. Dozens were injured, including 10 police officers.
The police did not provide additional information on the circumstances of the man's death.
""We have a right to know where the money has gone because it has not been used to help develop the country,"" said 24-year-old protester Jeremie Merovier.

""Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public,"" Raab said in a letter on Wednesday to the parliamentary Procedure Committee that will advise on how to carry out the so-called meaningful vote.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>",May faces EU leaders as Brexit talks stall,"By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed a Brexit deal was still possible as she arrived in Brussels on Wednesday to meet her European Union counterparts, three days after talks stalled over how to manage the Irish border.
But fellow EU leaders sounded impatient, signalling that they were ready to listen to May but also preparing to discuss plans for Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a deal.
In pointed remarks, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite told reporters that the essence of the problem lay in May's inability to rally her feuding party around a workable set of negotiating demands. There was still time for a deal, she said, but there would be no breakthrough yet.
May did not answer a question about whether she had brought the ""creative"" new proposal that summit chair Donald Tusk has asked for, instead sticking to a rehearsed line that a deal could be done and that it was in the EU's interest to reach one.
""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the Northern Irish backstop,"" she told reporters on arrival.
""By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that deal,"" May added. ""Now is the time to make it happen.""
Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the tougher tone coming from the 27 other governments, whose leaders will gather over dinner after a presentation by May at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT).
All member states, she said before flying to the summit, must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
Tusk had called on May to come to Brussels with new ideas to unblock the process, but British officials have given little indication that she has much new to say as she battles deep opposition among her own allies to the kind of agreement which Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
May earlier told parliament in London she wanted any treaty that includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate declaration the two sides intend to issue on their intentions for a close EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory relationship could avert the kind of border disruption that risk reviving sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, but they still want a ""backstop"" guarantee that if that is not in place, then the EU would keep the province in a special economic zone.
May and her Northern Irish allies reject that as posing a risk of breaking up the United Kingdom.
TRANSITION EXTENSION
EU diplomats told Reuters on Monday that EU negotiator Michel Barnier offered to help defuse the issue by extending a status-quo transition period for Britain by an extra year to the end of 2021 to give time for a trade deal that would avert the need to trigger a backstop for Northern Ireland.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, whose chamber needs to see a treaty this year to have time to ratify it by March, told reporters that he would support Barnier's proposal to lengthen the transition period to three years from two.
Many continental officials involved in the process have said a longer transition may be needed to conclude a free trade deal anyway. However, May is also under pressure from Brexit supporters to cut ties to the bloc as soon as possible.
There is unlikely to be much dialogue around the table when May addresses other leaders on Wednesday. They have insisted that London negotiate exclusively through Barnier.
The 27 will then dine without May and hear reports from Barnier and from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. He will brief them on how the EU executive is stepping up planning and guidance for governments on what must be done to cope with Britain leaving on March 29 with no treaty in place.
Both sides are coming under pressure from business to reach agreement soon to avoid firms running up needless costs.
A joint pre-summit plea from the European auto and car parts sector warned disruption to cross-Channel supply chains would be ""catastrophic"" and wipe out much of a quarter-century of recovery in England's car industry.

May will rejoin her EU counterparts on Thursday as the focus shifts to a summit with Asian leaders, including China's Premier Li Keqiang and the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and Russia.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>","U.S. courts abruptly tossed 9,000 deportation cases. Here's why","By Reade Levinson and Kristina Cooke
(Reuters) - Liliana Barrios was working in a California bakery in July and facing possible deportation when she got a call from her immigration attorney with some good news. 
The notice to appear in court that Barrios had received in her deportation case hadn’t specified a time or date for her first hearing, noting that they would be determined later. Her lawyer was calling to say that the U.S. Supreme Court had just issued a ruling that might open the door for her case, along with thousands of others, to be dismissed.
The Supreme Court case involved Wescley Fonseca Pereira, a Brazilian immigrant who overstayed his visa and was put into deportation proceedings in 2006. The initial paperwork he was sent did not state a date and time of appearance, however, and Pereira said he did not receive a subsequent notice telling him where and when to appear. When he failed to show up in court, he was ordered deported.
The Supreme Court ruled that paperwork failing to designate a time and place didn’t constitute a legal notice to appear in court. 
The ruling sparked a frenzy of immigration court filings. Over ten weeks this summer, a record 9,000 deportation cases, including Barrios’, were terminated as immigration attorneys raced to court with challenges to the paperwork their clients had received, a Reuters analysis of data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review shows. The number represents a 160 percent increase from the same time period a year earlier and the highest number of terminations per month ever. 
For a graph of the trend, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QCbeJZ 
Then, just as suddenly as they began, the wave of case terminations stopped. On August 31, in a different case, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that charging documents issued without a date and time were valid so long as the immigrant received a subsequent hearing notice filling in the details, as is the usual procedure. 
A Department of Justice official said that as a result of the BIA decision, the issues “have been solved.” 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to requests for comment, but the agency laid out its thoughts on the terminations in court documents opposing the motions to terminate. In a San Diego case, DHS wrote that the motions were based on a “misreading” of the Supreme Court decision. “If read in a manner most favorable to the respondent, the practical impact would be to terminate virtually all immigration proceedings.” The Supreme Court decision “nowhere purports to invalidate the underlying removal proceedings,” DHS wrote.
The dueling interpretations will now be weighed by a federal appeals court, which could uphold or overturn the BIA decision in coming months. The case could ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. 
""ONE GASP""
Having a removal case terminated, as Liliana Barrios and many others did over the summer, does not confer legal status, but it does remove the threat of imminent deportation and provide an immigrant time to pursue legal ways of staying in the country, such as asylum or by accruing enough time in the country to be eligible to stay through a process known as cancellation of removal.   
The Supreme Court ruling provided a “brief glimmer of hope”, said immigration lawyer Aaron Chenault, “like when you are almost drowning and you get one gasp.”
The Department of Homeland Security can appeal the case dismissals or it can restart deportation proceedings by issuing a new notice to appear. By the end of August, the most recent date for which records are available, government attorneys had appealed only 2,100 of the cases terminated in the wake of the decision, according to a Reuters analysis. 
Roxie Rawls-de Santiago, an immigration attorney in New Mexico, said that for some of her clients, even a few months of not being in active deportation proceedings could make a difference. One woman whose case was terminated, for example, has a U.S. citizen daughter who turns 21 next year, the age at which she can sponsor her mother for permanent residency, and the woman is now hopeful she can stave off deportation proceedings until then. 
CHAOS IN THE COURTS
At the Department of Justice, which administers the immigration courts, chaos reigned in the weeks following the June decision. Immigration judges and officials struggled to agree on an interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling, according to internal emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by immigration attorney Matthew Hoppock and shared with Reuters.
“The issue has VERY large implications, in that DHS has put the actual “time and date” on VERY, VERY few NTA’s, if any. Any guidance would be helpful,” wrote Memphis immigration judge Richard Averwater in an email to an assistant chief immigration judge days after the ruling. Averwater declined to discuss the email further. 
In San Francisco alone, immigration judges terminated 2,000 cases between June 21 and August 31, sometimes more than 100 a day, according to a Reuters analysis. In San Antonio, more than 1,200 cases were terminated.  
“The court was getting dozens and dozens and dozens of those a day,” said Ashley Tabaddor, president of the immigration judges’ union. “The large number of terminations that happened were directly a result of Pereira.”
The door to mass dismissals for such cases could be reopened or remain closed depending on how the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the Board of Immigration Appeals decision that stopped them. 
For Barrios, 20, who was caught crossing the Southern border illegally with her toddler two years ago, her dismissal has meant more time to file for a special visa for immigrants under the age of 21 who have been abandoned or neglected. Barrios said she was abandoned by her mother. 

Having her case terminated “lifted the pressure a bit,” said Barrios, who makes cream for cookies at a wholesale bakery in California during the day and studies English at night. The Department of Homeland Security has appealed her case termination.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",Canada becomes first industrialized nation to legalize cannabis,"By Chris Wattie and Nichola Saminather
ST JOHN'S, Newfoundland/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada became the first industrialized nation to legalize recreational cannabis on Wednesday, but a lawful buzz will be hard to come by in its biggest cities like Toronto and Vancouver, which will have no stores open.
Weed enthusiasts in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada's easternmost province, kicked off the first permissible sales at midnight. Over 100 people braved the cold and wind in the province's capital St. John's, lining up outside a Tweed-branded store owned by Canopy Growth Corp., the world's most recognized cannabis producer. 
Canopy's Chief Executive Bruce Linton rang in the first sales to residents Ian Power and Nikki Rose. 
""I came out tonight to be the first person in Canada to purchase the first legal gram of recreational cannabis, to help see the end of prohibition in Canada finally,"" Power said. 
The day was historic for the country as adult Canadians will be able to legally smoke recreational marijuana after nearly a century-long ban.
However, many provincial governments' approval of only a small number of shops so far, and a shortage of weed supplied to these stores, means most Canadians' first toke on Wednesday will likely be of black-market pot.
""There will be a lot of celebrations on the day, and it will almost all be with illegal cannabis"" in some of Canada's biggest cities, said Brad Poulos, an instructor and cannabis business expert at Ryerson University in Toronto. ""Recreational cannabis users in Canada . . . will just continue with their (existing) sources of supply until the legal system catches up.""
Despite the dearth of stores in Canada's biggest cities, consumers can buy legal marijuana online, from provincial governments or licensed retailers, although delivery will take a few days.
Other countries around the world, many of whom are just approving medical marijuana, are watching Canada's recreational legalization, which combines federal rules with varying provincial regulations.
The move is a political win for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who vowed to legalize cannabis in his 2015 election campaign. That pledge was aimed at taking profits away from organized crime and regulating the production, distribution and consumption of a product that millions of Canadians had been consuming illegally.
But provinces and businesses have struggled to prepare, and legalization was pushed back from original expectations of a July start to enable setting up distribution and sales networks.
In the run-up to legalization, cannabis companies have been on a tear, as companies struck deals while others went public, creating an investor frenzy.
The federal government and many provinces have been cautious, starting with limited stores and products, including no edibles for a year, and tight control over supply.
WEED SHORTAGE
Ontario, home to Canada's most populous city, Toronto, will have no physical stores until April 2019, due to a change to the province's retail model by a new provincial government. 
British Columbia, which plans both province-run and private outlets, has only one government store 350 kilometers (220 miles) from its biggest city, Vancouver. Private store licenses will only be issued after legalization, the province's Minister of Public Safety Mike Farnworth said. 
""October 18th is going to look very much like October 16th, in many ways,"" Farnworth said.
Even in provinces with more shops, empty shelves are likely due to a shortage of product. A study by the University of Waterloo and economic policy think tank C.D. Howe Institute found legal supply will satisfy under 60 percent of demand in the early months, though that will change as production increases.
""Oct. 17 will . . . probably be the least elegant day,"" Canopy's CEO Linton said. ""But the key message is not how it works on the first day but that there is a first day.""
Law enforcement going forward could be patchy. In August, Canada approved a device to detect levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabis's psychoactive element, in drivers' oral fluids. 
But many large police departments will forego the C$5,000 device, Adam Palmer, president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, told reporters on Monday.
Draeger Safety Canada, which makes the device, has shipped some units, but a two-week federal funding delay has put further orders on hold, although it expects demand for between 300 and 500 units through March, Managing Director Rob Clark said. 
Canada has invested C$274 million to enforce the new laws and some provinces have allocated their own funding, but Palmer said police will not crack down on illegal stores right away. 

""When the law changes on the 17th, we're not going to see a big change overnight,"" Palmer said. ""Police aren’t . . . chomping at the bit to go out and start raiding stores.""

Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of rebels who rose up against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The area is also home to an estimated 3 million people, more than half of whom have already been displaced at least once during the war.
Turkey and Russia reached a deal to set up a buffer zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) deep into rebel territory that had to be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadists by Monday. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist alliance spearheaded by al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in the region.
""The withdrawal of heavy weapons is complete by all accounts,"" James Jeffrey, the U.S. special representative for Syria engagement, told reporters in Ankara during a brief visit with the U.S. secretary of state. ""There is some question as to whether everybody from (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) has left.""
He said 50,000-70,000 remained in the area. 
""Most of them are part of the opposition that we used to work with and the Turks still do,"" he said. He estimated that between 7,000-10,000 are militants.
Approximately 40 percent of the country does not fall under control of Assad's government, he added.
Turkey and the United States hold regular coordinated patrols in northern Syria's Manbij area, where the Kurdish YPG militia has a presence. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has warned that Ankara ""will do what is necessary"" to ensure the YPG leaves Manbij as per the agreement with the United States.
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization.
Erdogan told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Turkey could easily clear the town if the United States failed to do so, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday.
Jeffrey said the negotiations between Pompeo and Cavusoglu are now being carried out and that the United States has troops in Turkey training with Turkish troops to carry out joint patrols around Manbij.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Italy renews pro-Russia push ahead of EU summit,"By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy's euroskeptic government is pushing for a reduction of tensions between the European Union and Russia but risks isolation in Brussels as EU partners seek instead stronger measures to deter Moscow from interfering in EU affairs.
Russia has been subjected to EU sanctions since the 2014 Ukraine crisis and Rome has long urged a relaxation of the penalties on the grounds that they have hit Italian firms trading with Moscow.
In a new pro-Russia thrust, Italy is now calling on EU partners to back a plan to channel EU money to small Russian firms that operate in sectors not covered by existing EU sanctions on banking, defense and the energy industry, three diplomats told Reuters.
That initiative preceded a two-day summit of EU leaders due to start later on Wednesday in Brussels.
Rome is also resisting EU proposals to impose sanctions on countries that carry out cyber-attacks, in another move seen as being in favor of Moscow.
Diplomats said the new EU sanctions regime would be aimed mostly at Russia, which has been in recent months at the center of allegations of elections meddling via social media in various Western states, as well as cyber warfare and security breaches conducted through electronic means. 
Italy was the only EU member state that openly resisted the new sanctions regime, according to a confidential EU document seen by Reuters. 
Italian officials declined comment.
RUSSIAN TRIPS
The diplomatic push in Brussels coincides with a visit of Italy's far right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini to Russia on Wednesday, the second since he was sworn in four months ago. 
Salvini, who leads Italy's co-ruling League party, is an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western elections. 
Polls show the League has multiplied its supporters in recent months also thanks to hardline slogans against the European Union. 
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is likely to repeat calls for better relations with Russia at the EU summit. He is then planning to fly to Moscow next week.
Rome's calls for EU funding to Russian small firms are not expected to be reflected in the joint document that EU leaders will approve at the end of their meeting this week, diplomats said. But the EU Commission could be asked to explore the feasibility of such a plan.
The move is likely to be opposed by Britain and eastern European countries who fear that existing sanctions could be by-passed, one diplomat said.
A spokeswoman for the EU foreign affairs chief was not immediately available for comments.
Italy's opposition to cyber sanctions has contributed to a softening of the wording of the final joint summit document which in its last draft version says work ""should be taken forward"" on cyber defenses ""through EU restrictive measures"".

Britain and other backers of the sanctions would have preferred clearer commitments.

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A lack of power and phone service in the areas of Florida flattened by Hurricane Michael last week was hindering efforts on Wednesday to distribute food and water and to contact residents not heard from since the storm plowed through the state's Panhandle.
The hurricane, one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States, killed at least 27 people. It packed top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour) and unleashed a surge of seawater that demolished homes. 
Florida officials have not said how many people are missing. Many people may not be able to call friends and family or may be staying elsewhere and are not necessarily presumed dead. Debris, downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people. 
Teams made up of hundreds of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were searching for more than 1,135 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family, Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue. 
Most of those missing are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said.
He said the search has been hindered by spotty cell phone coverage in the devastated area, though authorities are making progress in restoring communications. 
Many residents have also expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery of wireless networks. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday called for wireless carriers to waive bills for customers affected by the storm. 
The death toll includes 17 in Florida, one in Georgia, three in North Carolina and six in Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida resulted from the storm.
About 35,000 Floridians have called the Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking help since and the agency has already approved $1 million in assistance for people in 12 counties, spokesman Ruben Brown in Tallahassee said. 
FEMA has distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, he said.
The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott's office said. 
In Mexico Beach, which took a direct hit, the number of people missing dropped to three on Tuesday, said Rex Putnal, a city councilor. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday.
Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. 
At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some.
Countless numbers of people in the region's backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least 17 people were killed and dozens injured at a college in the Black Sea region of Crimea on Wednesday when a student went through the building shooting at fellow pupils before killing himself, Russian law enforcement officials said.
Eighteen-year-old Vladislav Roslyakov turned up at the college in the city of Kerch on Wednesday afternoon carrying a firearm and then began shooting, investigators said. His body was later found in the college with what they said were self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
There were no immediate clues as to his motive in mounting such an attack, which recalled similar shooting sprees carried out by students in U.S. schools.
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, prompting international condemnation and Western sanctions, but since then there have been no major outbreaks of violence there.
Many of the victims from Wednesday's attacks were teenage students who suffered shrapnel and bullet wounds. 
Pupils and staff described scenes of mayhem as panicked pupils tried to flee the building. They said the attack had started with an explosion, followed by more blasts, and a hail of gunfire.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting in the southern Russian resort of Sochi with his Egyptian counterpart, declared a moment's silence for the victims.
""This is a clearly a crime,"" he said. ""The motives will be carefully investigated."" 
""CHILDREN'S BODIES EVERYWHERE""
The director of the school, Olga Grebennikova, described the scene that she encountered when she entered the college building after the attack.
""There are bodies everywhere, children's bodies everywhere. It was a real act of terrorism. They burst in five or 10 minutes after I'd left. They blew up everything in the hall, glass was flying,"" Grebennikova told Crimean media outlets.
""They then ran about throwing some kind of explosives around, and then ran around the second floor with guns, opened the office doors, and killed anyone they could find.""
Soon after the attack, Russian officials said they were investigating the possibility that it was terrorism. Troops with armored personnel carriers were sent to the scene. Local parents were told to collect their children from the city's schools and kindergartens for their safety.
However, the Investigative Committee, the state body that investigates major crimes, said later that it was re-classifying the case from terrorism to mass murder.
Officials had previously given the death toll as 18, but the Committee revised that to 17 killed. An employee at Kerch's hospital said dozens of people were being treated for their injuries in the emergency room and in the operating theater.
Anastasia Yenshina, a 15-year-old student at the college, said she was in a toilet on the ground floor of the building with some friends when she heard the sound of an explosion.
""I came out and there was dust and smoke, I couldn't understand, I'd been deafened,"" she told Reuters. ""Everyone started running. I did not know what to do. Then they told us to leave the building through the gymnasium.""
""Everyone ran there... I saw a girl lying there. There was a child who was being helped to walk because he could not move on his own. The wall was covered in blood. Then everyone started to climb over the fence, and we could still hear explosions. Everyone was scared. People were crying."" 
Photographs from the scene of the blast showed that the ground floor windows of the two-story building had been blown out, and that debris was lying on the floor outside. 
Emergency services teams could be seen in the photographs carrying wounded people from the building on makeshift stretchers and loading them on to buses and ambulances.
A second pupil at the college, who gave his name as Sergei, said he had taken a few steps out of the building into the street when the first blast went off. He was hit by debris from the blast and injured in the leg.
Sergei, 15, told Reuters he ran to another building, but said he could hear more explosions going off every few seconds. He took cover and after the attack was over, he was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

""I arrived at the hospital, the scene there was awful. They're bringing in people all covered in blood, some with arms missing, some with legs missing.""

955,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 09:15AM ET</span>",Pompeo meets Erdogan after talks with Saudis on missing journalist,"By Leah Millis and Tulay Karadeniz
ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Turkey's President and Foreign Minister on Wednesday to discuss the disappearance of a Saudi journalist as pressure mounted on the kingdom to provide answers following Turkish allegations he was killed.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt on Tuesday even as U.S. lawmakers pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership and Pompeo, sent by Trump to address the crisis, discussed the affair with Saudi King Salman and his Crown Prince on a visit to Riyadh.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said Pompeo would provide information about the case after Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, vanished during a visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 to collect marriage documents.
Cavusoglu provided no details following Pompeo's two 40-minute meetings at the airport with Cavusoglu and President Tayyip Erdogan, describing them only as ""beneficial and fruitful"". Cavusolgu did say that Turkey hoped to enter the Saudi consul's residence on Wednesday. 
Pompeo did not address reporters.
Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi - a prominent critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - was murdered and his body removed. Turkish sources have told Reuters the authorities have an audio recording indicating Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate.
The Saudis have strongly denied those allegations, but U.S. media outlets have reported they will acknowledge he was killed in a botched interrogation. Trump has speculated without providing evidence that ""rogue killers"" could be responsible.
Turkish police had been expected to search the Saudi consul's Istanbul residence on Tuesday. They did not do so, officers at the scene said late on Tuesday, because Saudi officials were not able to join. Hours earlier, the consul general left Turkey for Riyadh.
""Yesterday evening, unfortunately, police could not search the Saudi consul's residence. The Saudis claimed that the consul's family was inside,"" he told reporters. 
""We hope the police will enter the residence today. We have said before that Saudi Arabia must cooperate with us in every aspect without delay.""
An 11-member Saudi investigation team arrived at the consul's Istanbul residence, broadcaster CNN Turk said.
TEST FOR CROWN PRINCE
How the crown prince emerges from the crisis is a test of how the West will deal with Saudi Arabia in the future. At issue will be to what extent the West believes responsibility for Khashoggi lies with the powerful young ruler.
A pro-government Turkish daily published preliminary evidence last week from investigators who it said had identified a 15-member Saudi intelligence team that arrived in Istanbul on diplomatic passports hours before Khashoggi disappeared.
A New York Times report, citing witnesses and other records, linked four suspects to Prince Mohammed's security detail.
One name matches a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for a forensic expert who has worked at the interior ministry for 20 years. Another is identified in a diplomatic directory from 2007 as a first secretary at the Saudi Embassy in London. Others resemble officers in the Saudi Army and Air Force.
After his meetings with the King and Crown Prince on Tuesday, Pompeo said Saudi Arabia has committed to conducting a full investigation.
""They indicated they understood that getting that done in a timely, rapid fashion so they could begin to answer important questions,"" he told reporters traveling with him.
Asked whether they said Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said: ""They didn't talk about any of the facts.""
Earlier, Trump tweeted that Prince Mohammed had denied knowing what happened in the Saudi consulate.
""I think we have to find out what happened first,"" Trump told the Associated Press in an interview on Tuesday. ""Here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. I don't like that.""
DESERTED CONFERENCE
Prince Mohammed, who has enjoyed a close relationship with the Trump administration, has painted himself as the face of a new, vibrant Saudi Arabia, diversifying its economy away from reliance on oil and making some social changes.
But there has been mounting criticism of some of the prince's moves, including Riyadh's involvement in the Yemen war, the arrest of women activists, and a diplomatic row with Canada.
Members of the U.S. Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, are among the loudest voices in the United States demanding answers and action on Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who moved to Washington last year fearing retribution for his critical views.
Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican close to Trump, has called Prince Mohammed ""a wrecking ball"" and accused him of ordering Khashoggi's murder.
Despite concerns about Saudi human rights, Trump still says he is unwilling to pull out of arms sales accords with Riyadh. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plans to attend an investment conference in Riyadh next week known as ""Davos in the desert"", even as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) CEO Frederic Oudea joined a growing list of executives who have pulled out.
The event is unrelated to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Switzerland.

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and a partner in U.S. efforts to combat Iranian influence in the region, has said it would retaliate against any pressure or economic sanctions.

BIEN HOA AIR BASE, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday visited a former American air base in southern Vietnam that will soon become the biggest-ever U.S. cleanup site for contamination left by the defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.
Standing near a skull-and-crossbones warning sign meant to keep people away from toxic soil, Mattis was briefed by Vietnamese officials about the massive contamination area.
In a possible sign of the sensitivity surrounding Agent Orange in Vietnam, where millions of people are still suffering its effects, reporters were not allowed to attend the outdoor briefing for Mattis at Bien Hoa Air Base. 
""I came to show the support of the Defense Department for this project and demonstrate that the United States makes good on its promises,"" Mattis told his Vietnamese counterpart at a closed-door meeting later in nearby Ho Chi Minh City.
Cleanup is expected to start getting under way early next year.
U.S. troops dropped Agent Orange during the Vietnam War to clear thick jungle. But it contributed to severe health problems that, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, can include Parkinson's Disease, prostate cancer and Chronic B-cell Leukemia.
Of the 4.8 million Vietnamese who were exposed to Agent Orange, some three million are still dealing with its effects, including children born with severe disabilities or other health issues years after their parents were exposed, according to the Hanoi-based Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange.
WARMING RELATIONS
More than four decades after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, ties between the United States and Vietnam are less seen through the prism of the conflict and more through shared concerns over China. 
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and has been buying U.S. military hardware, including an armed, Hamilton-class Coast Guard cutter. 
The United States, in turn, accuses China of militarizing the strategic waterway, through which more than $3 trillion in cargo passes every year, and sees Vietnam as a crucial ally in drawing regional opposition to Beijing's behavior. 
But U.S. officials including Mattis - who is on his second trip to Vietnam just this year - hope that addressing America's wartime legacies like Agent Orange can become a vehicle for further strengthening ties.
When a U.S. aircraft carrier visited Vietnam in March, for example, one of the places U.S. sailors visited was a Vietnamese shelter for people suffering from the effects of Agent Orange. 
The United States just completed a five-year, $110 million program that cleaned soil contaminated by Agent Orange at Danang International Airport, which was one of the main air bases used for storing and spraying the herbicide between 1961 and 1971.
But officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is overseeing the project, said the Bien Hoa site will be four times larger than Danang, a massive undertaking that is expected to cost $390 million, according to a fact sheet distributed to reporters. 
According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS), one soil sample from Bien Hoa had a ""toxic equivalency,"" or TEQ, of more than 1,000 times over the international limit.
A 2011 study conducted by a private consulting firm determined that contaminated soil had spread from hot spots at the base into nearby lakes, ponds, creeks, and drainage ditches, increasing the amount of soil and sediment that will require treatment.

""The impacts on the community is very difficult to measure. Dioxin has impacts (on health) at very low concentrations and they're not real consistent,"" one of the U.S. AID officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

There was no immediate confirmation from the government. Earlier, it had been widely reported Kotzias had clashed with Defence Minister Panos Kammenos over a deal brokering an end to a decades-old name dispute with Macedonia.
Kotzias was Greece's main negotiator in the talks that led to the June accord with Skopje to rename the neighboring country North Macedonia.
That deal has however been thrown in limbo following a referendum in Macedonia on Sept. 30 which failed to muster a minimum turnout to render it valid.
Greek media reported on Wednesday that Kotzias and Kammenos, a coalition partner in the government, had argued during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday chaired by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.

Kammenos, who heads the small right-wing Independent Greeks party, is vehemently against the accord with Macedonia and has said he could quit the government over it.

PARIS (Reuters) - French far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, already the target of an anti-corruption inquiry, came under further scrutiny on Wednesday when prosecutors opened a separate investigation into his alleged intimidation of investigators. 
Melenchon, a well-known firebrand and former presidential candidate, was caught on camera on Monday yelling at and jostling an anti-corruption officer who was part of a team carrying out a raid at Melenchon's party offices. 
The footage, widely shared on social media, showed the 67-year-old prodding his finger in the officer's face and screaming: ""Get out of my way and let me open the door. I am the republic, it's me who's the member of parliament.""
The Paris prosecutor's office said Melenchon was being investigated for intimidation of a member of the judiciary and violence toward public servants.
The politician and a group of backers from his France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party eventually pushed their way into the room, where there was more pushing and shoving and a scuffle involving a policeman and an unidentified person. 
The swoop followed a similar raid at Melenchon's home in Paris. The politician broadcast the raid by phone onto social media, describing it as ""an act of political aggression"".
In the broadcast, he criticized Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, saying: ""Madame Belloubet, are you proud of yourself for what you doing here? Have you forgotten everything, who you are, who I am? Nobody touches me. I am a member of parliament. My person is sacrosanct.""
The new inquiry comes on top of two funding investigations, one looking into the alleged misuse of European Parliament funds to pay his party employees in France, and the other examining funding of his presidential campaign last year.
Interviewed on BFM TV on Wednesday, before news of the latest probe, Melenchon denounced the anti-corruption raids, saying: ""We're being treated like a bunch of gangsters.""
Police representatives criticized his behavior, as did President Emmanuel Macron's government.
""He made a mockery of magistrates and the judicial procedure,"" said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux.

""That's strange to say the least, coming from someone who wanted to become president and, as such, guardian of an independent judiciary.""

Iran's Fars News agency also quoted Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari on Wednesday as saying that infiltrators had helped with the abduction of at least 10 staff to Pakistan on Tuesday.
Fars originally mentioned the reports of tainted food on Tuesday.
An Iranian separatist group called Jaish al-Adl said on Tuesday it had seized the personnel, which included members of the Guards, at the Mirjaveh border post in Sistan-Baluchestan province to avenge the oppression of Sunni Muslims in the area.
Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim authorities say militant groups operate from safe havens in Pakistan.
Jafari said what he called ""enemies"" had tried unsuccessfully in the past to occupy Iranian turrets or border posts. ""This time they were able to carry out their operation by bringing in an infiltrating force,” he said.
""They were sure that as long as the fighters and defenders are alert, they cannot achieve their goal, so they were able to kidnap these individuals by making them unconscious.""
Jafari promised the kidnappers a tough response.
In previous cases of cross-border clashes, Iran threatened to hit militant bases in Pakistan unless Islamabad took action.
However, the head of the Guards’ ground forces, Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour, said on Tuesday that Iran was ready to conduct joint military operations with Pakistan to release the kidnapped personnel.
Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of funding separatist groups on its territory. Riyadh has denied any involvement in Iranian internal affairs.
In September, the Revolutionary Guards killed four Sunni militants at a border crossing with Pakistan, including the second-in-command of Jaish al-Adl.

Jaish al-Adl kidnapped five Iranian border guards in 2014, releasing four of them two months later after mediation by local Sunni clerics.

Pompeo raised the issue with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in a meeting in Ankara, where he also met with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. 
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, vanished during a visit to Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to collect marriage documents.

Golge was visiting family in southern Turkey when he was arrested in a crackdown following a failed military coup in 2016 which the government blamed on supporters of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.
He has denied the charges. His sentence last month was reduced to five years.
Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants over suspected links to the coup attempt, according to the U.N. human rights office. 
U.S.-Turkish relations have been strained over the detentions as well as other issues, and the United States has imposed sanctions and tariffs on Ankara. 
Pastor Brunson, whose detention fueled a diplomatic crisis that sent the lira tumbling this year, had also been charged with terrorism offences. He was released on Friday and returned to the United States.

On Wednesday, Brunson's lawyer said he was appealing the verdict and sentence in Turkish court.

Akbar has filed a defamation suit against one of the women who have accused him of a range of inappropriate behavior during his career as a journalist before entering politics.
""Since I have decided to seek justice in a court of law in my personal capacity, I deem it appropriate to step down from office and challenge false accusations levied against me in a personal capacity,"" ANI, a Reuters partner, quoted Akbar as saying in a statement.
The #MeToo movement, which began in the United States more than a year ago in response to accusations of sexual harassment and abuse by powerful men in the entertainment industry, gained traction in India in late September after the actress Tanushree Dutta said prominent actor Nana Patekar behaved inappropriately on the sets of a film they were shooting in 2008. 
Patekar has denied any wrongdoing.
Since then, more than a dozen men in the media, entertainment, political and art worlds have been accused of offences, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. 
India is traditionally a conservative country, where discussions about sex are still taboo for many and where women have long lagged behind men in workplace participation.

The upper house Senate said on Tuesday it would investigate the fund it said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was using without subjecting the monies for parliamentary scrutiny via the national budget.
NNPC responded with a statement titled ""we don't have $3.5 billion subsidy fund"". It said a $1.05 billion ""National Fuel Support Fund"" did exist, set up by the company ""to ensure stability in the petroleum products supply"".
That fund was jointly managed by a group of bodies that included the NNPC, the central bank and the finance ministry, the statement by NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said. The fund was ""domiciled"" in the central bank and ""NNPC did not independently spend a dime"" of it, it added. 
Fuel subsidies are contentious in Africa's top crude oil producer, which imports most of its gasoline due to underperforming refineries. Prices are kept artificially low at 145 naira ($0.48) per litre.

As fuel prices increase globally, it has become unprofitable for private petrol marketers to import, with the NNPC stepping in to prevent major shortages.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron gathered his new government for its first post-reshuffle meeting on Wednesday and struck a contrite tone, looking to reboot his presidency after months of criticism and slumping polls. 
""People expect us to show steadfastness and coherence,"" he told the 35-member cabinet, a day after shaking up the administration and appointing close ally Christophe Castaner as interior minister, responsible for police and internal security.
""For me, the object of this government is simple: to build a power for the 21st century. Every day we need to explain the reforms being made, respond to concerns, but know that any single response doesn't hold unless we have a stronger nation.""
In a pre-recorded, televised address to the nation on Tuesday night, hours after carrying out the long-awaited reshuffle, Macron acknowledged making mistakes in his first 17 months in office, including off-the-cuff remarks that have led people to accuse him of arrogance and self-importance.
""My determination and my plain-speaking may have upset or shocked some of you, and I hear the criticism,"" he said, adding that he understood citizens were eager to see results from his reform agenda.
""I know there is impatience, I share it,"" the 40-year-old former investment banker said. ""Gradually, I'm sure, your daily life will get better because the government is on the right track and, above all, getting to the root of the problems.""
Macron enjoyed a bullish first few months in office, with business and consumer confidence improving and unemployment falling, but his fortunes have turned in recent months.
""A NATION TO TRANSFORM""
GDP growth forecasts for this year have been scaled back from 2.0 percent to 1.7 percent, the fall in unemployment has stalled and there is general consternation around Macron's reform agenda.
But it is more the style of his presidency that has rankled. His remarks berating striking workers for ""kicking up a bloody mess"" or dismissing critics of his labor reforms as ""slackers"" have turned off many voters. 
A scandal involving an Elysee Palace bodyguard caught on camera beating up May Day protesters further tarnished his reputation.
Polls once showed more than 60 percent approval for Macron's leadership, but now hover around 30 percent.
Even former members of his inner circle are critical. When former interior minister Gerard Collomb quit this month, he spoke of a lack of humility in Macron's team and the risk of hubris - excessive pride that leads to a downfall.
The next presidential election is not due until 2022, and the political opposition is largely in disarray. But Macron's reform program is so ambitious that he must stick to a tight schedule to carry it out.
Already there have been delays - planned changes to the number of parliamentarians and the introduction of some proportional representation have been postponed. But Macron was clear on Wednesday that plans to overhaul the pensions and unemployment benefits systems would not be knocked off course.

""We have a nation to transform,"" he told the ministers. ""The workload before us is immense ... the goal remains the same.""

Barley is expected to give up her current position in conservative Merkel's ruling coalition to lead the SPD's campaign in Germany for the election due in May.
With conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer under pressure to resign following his party's disastrous performance in a regional election in Bavaria on Sunday, Merkel may yet need to reshuffle her cabinet in the coming weeks.
Divisions within her cabinet widened in the run-up to the Bavaria election. 
Since the vote, the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CSU), has vowed to make the coalition work. CSU leader Seehofer had been Merkel's leading critic in the ruling alliance before the election
Barley said she wanted to help the SPD, junior partner in Merkel's ruling alliance, after the party suffered a battering in the Bavaria election, at which it won less than 10 percent of the vote. ""I want to make my contribution to things improving,"" she told reporters.

SPD leader Andrea Nahles added of Barley: ""She is a born European, with British father, a German mother, dual nationality, her two sons have grand parents from four European countries. She speaks four European languages fluently.""

In a surprise result, Yameen lost his re-election bid last month and initially conceded defeat. Last week, however, his lawyers went to the Supreme Court, saying his supporters had complained about rigging of votes and fraudulent ballot papers.

The guidelines, which apply to applications for developments outside the central area received on or after Jan. 17 next year, tighten rules first introduced in 2012.
Singapore this year unveiled its strongest property cooling measures in five years, including extra taxes on developers that had been paying record sums to buy land for residential use. 
""With the revised guidelines, developers are encouraged to provide a wide range of unit sizes that will cater to the diverse needs of all segments of the market, including larger families,"" the Urban Redevelopment Authority said in a circular posted on its website.
""The guidelines will also help moderate the reduction in dwelling unit sizes, safeguard the liveability of our residential estates and ensure that the local infrastructure will not be overly strained."" 
Under the revised rules, the maximum number of dwelling units per development will be calculated by a proposed building's gross floor area divided by 85 square meters, division by 70 square meters currently.

The new rules have also added more areas where the maximum number of units are calculated by total area divided by 100 square meters.

Restrictions on abortion vary by jurisdiction in Australia and though it had been illegal in Queensland under a 19th century statute, women had circumvented that using 1960s and 1970s common law rulings, which permit abortion on social and economic grounds. It was also permitted on medical grounds.
Under the new law, women can terminate pregnancies on request at up to 22 weeks gestation. The law passed Queensland's one-house parliament by 50 votes to 41.
""This is an historic day for Queensland,"" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted the state's premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, as saying.
""We now join other jurisdictions, both in Australia and around the world, in recognizing termination as a health matter.""
Abortion is a raging political battle in a number of countries, including the United States, where many conservatives hope the Supreme Court will eventually overturn a landmark 1973 ruling known as Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.

GAZA (Reuters) - A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit a house in the largest city in southern Israel early on Wednesday, prompting Israeli air strikes that killed a militant in the Palestinian enclave.
The attacks came a day after Egyptian mediators started a round of talks with officials from the Hamas Islamist group that controls Gaza, as part of efforts to negotiate a long-term ceasefire after months of violence along the border with Israel.
The rocket hit a two-story house in Beersheba before dawn, the Israeli military said. It gutted most of the home, blowing out concrete walls and its stone facade, showering its yard and an adjacent street with rubble.
The family living there managed to take shelter in a reinforced room after alert sirens sounded, said officials in the city about 40 km (25 miles) from the Gaza Strip.
Another rocket launched from Gaza and aimed at central Israel fell into the Mediterranean Sea, the military said. 
With a nod to the Egyptian talks, Hamas and other major militant groups in Gaza took the unusual step of denying responsibility, saying they rejected ""all irresponsible attempts to sabotage the Egyptian effort, including the firing of the rockets"" on Wednesday.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility from any of the other smaller groups that operate in Gaza.
Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel Radio that there was evidence to back up the Hamas statement. But he said Israeli policy dictated an ""immediate and forceful retaliation"" against Hamas targets because the organization controls Gaza.
EXPLOSIONS
Israel's military said it struck armed training camps in Gaza and also targeted a squad about to launch a rocket.
Health officials in Gaza said a 25-year-old Palestinian man, identified by Al-Mujahedeen Brigades - a small militant faction - as one of its members, was killed. Five other Palestinians were wounded in separate attacks.
Many people in Gaza awoke to the sounds of explosions. Families crowded into a nearby hospital where the dead man's mother collapsed over his body. 
Pillars of smoke rose from the sites bombed by Israel, including a port Hamas is constructing in the southern Gaza Strip and a naval police position. 
A senior Egyptian delegation has been holding talks with Hamas in Gaza since Tuesday on a ceasefire with Israel and ways to end 11 years of division with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction in the occupied West Bank.
A Palestinian source said Egyptian officials in Gaza have been in touch with Israel to try to avoid further escalation. 
Palestinians have been protesting along the border since March 30, demanding an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza and the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel’s founding in 1948. 

Around 200 Gazans have been killed by Israeli troops since the border protests began, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. Palestinians have launched incendiary balloons and kites into Israel and on occasion breached an Israeli frontier fence.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian far-right presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro and his team are increasingly confident of winning this month's election, and have switched on ""cruise control"" as they seek to glide to victory, top campaign sources say.
Bolsonaro has opened up a sizeable opinion poll lead over his leftist rival, Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad, ahead of the Oct. 28 run-off vote, and is now seeking to avoid pitfalls and ride to the presidency on a wave of anger over graft, rising violence, and a weak economy. 
Bolsonaro, who is still recovering from a near-fatal stab wound received on the campaign trail, will skip presidential debates and avoid campaigning, his would-be chief of staff, Congressman Onyx Lorenzoni, told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Lorenzoni said the debates were pointless and made no difference to his candidate's commanding lead in the race. 
Bolsonaro has previously suffered in the polls after debate appearances, where his relative lack of expertise on economic matters was shown up under tough questioning. His poll numbers have increased since his stabbing on Sept. 6, which some attribute to his lower profile as he recovers. 
In recent days, with victory ever-closer, Bolsonaro has ordered his team to step back from the limelight to avoid making public declarations that could hurt him in the final few days of the race, campaign sources told Reuters. 
Luciano Bivar, a federal congressman and founder of Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party (PSL), said it was the right strategy. 
""It's a very important moment for Brazilian society, and we all need to be very careful,"" he said. ""Today, the PSL is a protagonist on the political scene and we all have to be responsible.""
Earlier in the campaign, Bolsonaro was forced onto the defensive as his vice-presidential pick, retired General Hamilton Mourao, and his economic advisor, Paulo Guedes, made blunders over potential policies. 
Bolsonaro's hands-off strategy poses a major problem for Haddad, who faces an uphill battle to unify opposition to the poll-leader and needs to add luster to the damaged brand of the PT which ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and is blamed by many for the country's woes.
The party's founder, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is in jail after a corruption conviction, and as Lula's hand-picked candidate, Haddad is struggling to escape the shadow of a figure who is loved and loathed by many in Brazil. 
Bolsonaro, 63, a seven-term congressman who openly defends Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, is pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate and appealing to voters fed up with the political corruption and violent crime.
In response to attacks by Bolsonaro on Twitter on Tuesday, Haddad replied by urging his rival to debate him face to face. The former army captain replied by suggesting Haddad could soon join Lula in jail.
Bolsonaro has run an unorthodox campaign, relying on social media and grass roots rallies that have won him legions of fans who delight at his sharp words and Twitter putdowns. 

Nonetheless, polls show he is also widely disliked by many in the electorate who have been alienated by years of his misogynist, racist and homophobic comments.

Brunson, at the center of a diplomatic crisis which helped send the lira tumbling this year, was sentenced to more than three years for aiding terrorist organizations but was allowed to return to the United States and met President Donald Trump.
The verdict was appealed because it ""contravened the law and procedures,"" a copy of the application seen by Reuters showed.
The prosecutor in the case also challenged the verdict, citing the same reason, a copy of that application showed. Both documents showed that detailed appeals will be prepared once they receive the court verdict in writing.
The pastor was charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, who Ankara says orchestrated a failed 2016 coup. Brunson, 50, had lived in Turkey for more than 20 years. His arrest two years ago led to U.S. tariffs against Turkey and condemnation from Trump.
Relations between the two NATO allies have been under strain over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, Turkey's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system, and the U.S. jailing of an executive at a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions case.
The release of Brunson could help ease tensions, but political analysts say many problems remain, including Washington's request for the release of other U.S. citizens and employees jailed in Turkey.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in Ankara on Wednesday, met with the families of three Turkish employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission who were detained after the attempted coup, according to reporters traveling with him.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 06:07AM ET</span>",How Russia moved into Central Africa,"By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - When Central African Republic (CAR) pleaded for help last year to fight marauding militias, former colonial ruler France offered guns it had seized off Somalia. But Russia objected and donated its own weapons instead.
By early February, Russia had sent nine planes with weapons along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years served as a statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for global prestige and influence, and is part of a wider campaign shaking up long-standing power dynamics on the continent.
Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defense ministries and state media.
The continent's 54 member states at the United Nations – three of which sit on the Security Council at any given time –  form the organization's largest voting bloc and one of its most coherent, making them attractive allies for Russia. 
""The West is not very much loved by many countries. And many (see) Russia as the country that will oppose the West,"" said Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and historian at Russia's Institute for African Studies.
Besides sending arms and contractors to CAR, Russian national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's defense ministry said last week it planned to establish a five-person team at CAR's defense ministry.
Russia's moves come at a time when the defense ministry's influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing against a backdrop of heightened tension with the West. 
SEIZED WEAPONS
When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition that a spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad armed groups.
CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members, including France and Russia. It operates by consensus.
France first offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the proposal was too expensive. France then offered 1,400 AK47 assault rifles it had seized off Somalia in 2016, according to a Security Council memo and four diplomats.
Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled for use in another country under embargo, two diplomats said.
But mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions committee approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles, machineguns and grenade launchers in December, according to committee documents and diplomats.
""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us, subject to Security Council approval,"" said Albert Yaloke Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. ""If peace is restored tomorrow in CAR, I think everyone will be happy.""
Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment about committee proceedings. 
France's foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect the terms of its arms embargo exemption to keep the weapons out of the wrong hands.
'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED'
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was involved in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers. 
Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships that lapsed after the Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and strike business deals.
China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but it has shied away from any military involvement. It did go a step further last year, however, opening its first military base outside China in Djibouti. 
Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an Italian camp and Japan's only overseas base.
Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however, saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war. Moscow is now planning to build a logistics center at a port in neighboring Eritrea.
While France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former colonies Gabon, Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also operate in Chad, Mali and Niger, analysts say Washington's influence is on the wane. 
Its trade with the continent has halved in the past decade, though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task force based in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year.
""Our actions on the diplomatic and military side have sent a huge signal to our partners that we're not interested in Africa,"" said Donald Bolduc, who commanded U.S. special forces across the continent until last year.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but, ""there is space for other countries to play a positive role in the region"".
AFRICAN DEALS
As part of Russia's renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March, attended a summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the African Union, this year.
Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many African countries since 2015, though some have yet to come into force. The agreements typically involve providing weapons and training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.
Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic than transformative and say it's not clear if Russia has the resources, or desire, to continue expanding its presence.
But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia signed its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to discuss nuclear energy, agriculture and transportation projects.
Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which cooperates with Moscow in defense technology, and Russia is looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as energy projects in Chad.
Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa has increased fast, albeit from a low base. From 2010-2017, total trade rose to $4.2 billion a year from $1.6 billion, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies https://www.csis.org. 
During the same period, China's total trade with sub-Saharan Africa nearly doubled to $165 billion while U.S. trade more than halved to $37 billion.
WAGNER GROUP
Since arriving in CAR, the Russians' remit has expanded beyond military advice and into various economic and diplomatic activities, a Western diplomat and security source said, fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash.
In August, France, the United Kingdom and the United States blocked a Russian request to send more weapons. The U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a note to the sanctions committee that it was awaiting, ""confirmation that measures had been taken to ensure the secure management of the previous donation"".
Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from 250 to 1,000. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide details, nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. 
Yevgeny Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary Cossack organization who has ties to Russian security contractors, said there could be 1,000 in CAR and 5,000 to 10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan and Libya. 
One Russian private military contractor, the Wagner group, was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged presence there.
Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner contractors are in CAR. People with ties to the group have told Reuters it has carried out clandestine combat missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and Syria.
Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. 
Russia has also stepped into negotiations with militias in CAR, adding to Western misgivings about its presence.
According to a U.N. panel of experts, Touadera's Russian adviser has met militia leaders several times to discuss disarmament and the distribution of natural resources revenue.
Russia said in August after brokering talks between armed groups that Touadera had expressed gratitude for its involvement and that it intended to continue its mediation.
Reuters was unable to contact the adviser, Zakharov, for comment. 

""There is a real division between that guy and the rest of the presidential advisers,"" the security source said. ""When you ask, 'Can we see your colleague?' they say, 'Who, our colleague? We don't know him'.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Defamation lawsuits filed by two Indian public figures accused of sexual harassment have sparked warnings from women's rights activists and legal experts that prolonged court battles could put the brakes on the country's nascent #MeToo movement.
The movement, that began in the United States just over a year ago in response to accusations of sexual assault and harassment in the entertainment industry, gained traction in India in the past two weeks after a Bollywood actress complained about inappropriate behavior on film sets and complaints of improper conduct roiled India's biggest comedy group.
Since then, more than a dozen men in politics, media, entertainment and the arts have been accused of a range of offences, with several prominent figures either resigning or being suspended as a result. 
The cases have transfixed India, published on newspaper front pages and becoming a key talking point on prime-time television news shows in a conservative country where discussions about sex are still taboo for many.
But two of those accused, junior foreign minister M.J. Akbar and veteran actor Alok Nath, this week launched criminal defamation suits against their accusers. Lawyers and women's groups said that could act as a deterrent to more victims coming forward. 
Unlike in many countries, where defamation is a civil offense, Indian law also has provisions which classify it as a criminal offense punishable with a jail term of up to two years.
Cases typically drag on for years in India's overstretched legal system. Legal experts say defamation lawsuits, in particular, are sometimes used as a tool to stall opponents, especially against those who won't have the wherewithal to respond effectively to such cases.
""Criminal defamation is usually an arm twisting tactic and works as a deterrent because nobody wants to be potentially embroiled in court for years or face a jail term,"" said Samudra Sarangi, a partner at Indian law firm Panag & Babu which represents clients in defamation lawsuits. 
""Sometimes this law is used to suppress a victim's voice. Not all victims have the emotional fortitude to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial in India.""
Late on Monday, more than one hundred female authors, journalists and media figures signed a letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for Akbar's resignation and a government probe into the allegations.
""A criminal defamation charge is a clear attempt to bully, intimidate and silence those who are bringing to light systemic abuse of women by men in powerful positions,"" said the letter, written by the Network of Women in Media, the Foundation of Media Professionals and the Brihan Mumbai Union of Journalists.
""By ignoring this defining moment, and watching silently while a government minister sues a woman who has spoken out, your government is giving a regressive message: that the fundamental right to life, safety and dignity of a sizeable section of the workforce does not matter,"" it said.
ACCUSED FIGHT BACK
Modi is yet to publicly speak on the matter and calls to three spokespersons of his Bharatiya Janata Party were unanswered on Wednesday. However, Maneka Gandhi, minister for women & child development in Modi’s cabinet, has previously said a panel of judges will be set up to look into ""some"" of the #MeToo cases. 
The opposition Congress party is piling pressure on Modi, who faces a series of big state elections later this year and a national election that is due by May 2019.
""We want to ask the prime minister on which side he stands. Is he with the women or against them?"" Congress spokesman RPN Singh told reporters on Tuesday. 
Akbar, who founded and edited several newspapers before joining politics, has been accused of inappropriate behavior by at least a dozen women who had worked with him. 
He has called the accusations ""wild and baseless"".
On Monday, he filed the defamation suit against one of his accusers, journalist Priya Ramani, at a Delhi district court.
Ramani had ""intentionally put forward malicious, fabricated and salacious"" allegations to harm his reputation, the suit alleged. 
Ramani said in a statement on Twitter on Monday that she was ready to fight the defamation allegation ""as truth and the absolute truth is my only defense"". 
Ramani and Akbar did not respond to Reuters requests for further comment on the case. 
Ramani's husband, journalist Samar Halarnkar, wrote a column on Tuesday saying the lawsuit was being used to ""intimidate her, and through her to intimidate the others who have spoken up and silence others who have not"".
Meanwhile, Indian journalist Sucheta Dalal called for crowd-funding Ramani's legal costs in a Twitter post that received more than 3,000 likes, although an official fundraising campaign is yet to be set up. 
The other defamation case was filed by well-known screen and television actor Nath against writer and producer Vinta Nanda, who recently accused him of raping her in 1999.

Nath's lawyer Ashok Sarogi has said the allegations against his client were false. He did not respond to a request to comment on the defamation suit on Tuesday. Nath and Nanda could not be reached for comment.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's top court weighed an appeal on Wednesday by a U.S. student facing deportation under a law against foreign pro-Palestinian activists who call for boycotts of Israel.
Lara Alqasem, 22, flew to Israel on Oct. 2 on a study visa but was refused entry by security officials who cited her role as president of a small local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Florida.
Alqasem's case has touched off debate in Israel over whether democratic values have been compromised by a 2017 law that bars the entry of foreigners who publicly support boycotts over Israel's policies toward the Palestinians.
Alqasem, who is of Palestinian descent, has been detained at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv since being denied entry to the country. 
Jerusalem's Hebrew University, where she was due to begin a year-long master's program on Sunday, also urged the court to reconsider.
At a hearing in Israel's Supreme Court in Jerusalem, Alqasem's lawyers said she was no longer active in the boycott movement and should be allowed in, the same argument made to a lower court that rejected her appeal last week.
""Only someone who consistently and continuously calls for a boycott is somebody who should face a ban,"" Yotam Ben-Hillel, one of Alqasem's attorneys argued in front of the three justices. ""She made a commitment to the (lower court) that if she enters Israel, she will not call for a boycott.""
The three justices hearing the case said they would deliver their ruling in writing. Leora Bechor, another attorney acting for Alqasem said she was hoping for a swift verdict, possibly later in the day.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's stance is similar to other countries' practices. Israel's government has said it sees boycott movements not only as an attempt to isolate it over its occupation of territory which Palestinians seek for a state, but also as a campaign for its destruction.
Alqasem's lawyers have said she stopped her activities in the Students for Justice group months before the anti-boycott law came into effect.
Bechor said Alqasem could have opted to fly back to the United States, but had chosen to remain in airport detention to argue her case.

The MP, Abdul Jabar Qahraman, was killed as he prepared for Saturday's election, a senior government official said, becoming the 10th candidate killed in the past two months, with two more abducted and four wounded by hardline Islamist militants.
""Such brutal acts of the terrorists and their supporters cannot weaken people's trust in the peaceful and democratic processes,"" President Abdul Ghani said in a statement condemning the attack. 
The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast in the southern province of Helmand, saying in a statement, ""We have killed Qahraman, a renowned communist.""
The Taliban have ordered Afghans to boycott the much-delayed parliamentary polls in their battle to overthrow the Western-backed government and establish their own Islamist regime.
Three men sitting in Qahraman's office at the time were also killed, said interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi, adding that police had arrested three suspects in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.
The blast wounded seven people, said Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. 
""A bomb was placed below Qahraman's chair in his campaign office,"" he added. ""We are investigating the incident.""
Wednesday's blast follows the deaths of 22 people last week in an explosion at an election rally for a woman candidate in the northeastern province of Takhar.

General Apirat Kongsompong, who took up his post this month, said the army was being closely watched and would strive to remain neutral. 
""We have to tread carefully....We cannot let politics use us,"" Apirat told reporters in Bangkok.
When asked by a reporter if he was prepared to launch another coup, Apirat said: ""If politics does not create conflict like in the past, there is no need for us to intervene.""
Thailand has been under military rule since a May 2014 coup which the army said was necessary to restore order after months of pro and anti-government protests. 
The government, led by former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, the current prime minister, has repeatedly delayed elections with the latest poll date now set for February 2019.
The Southeast Asian country has a history of military interference starting in 1932 with the overthrow of the absolute monarchy through a bloodless revolt. 
In 2006, the military ousted popularly elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecommunications billionaire.
The latest 2014 putsch saw his sister, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, ejected from power.

The coups were part of a long-running power struggle between Shinawatra supporters and the military-backed royalist elite.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>",Zika in Africa: Rare birth defect on the rise in Angola,"By Stephen Eisenhammer and Julie Steenhuysen
LUANDA/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Emiliano Cula starts to cry as his tiny fingers, curled into a tight fist, are stretched by a physical therapist to stimulate motor control.
Born in a poor neighborhood of Angola’s capital Luanda, the 10-month old boy has microcephaly, a birth defect marked by a small head and serious developmental problems. He still can’t sit upright and has difficulty seeing and hearing. 
“They don’t know what caused it,” Cula’s mother Marie Boa says, sheltering under a blue umbrella from the summer rains. “The doctor said it might have been caused by a mosquito, but I don’t know if that’s true.”  The 18-year-old does not know whether her first child will ever walk or talk.
Cula is one of at least 72 babies born with microcephaly in Angola between February 2017 and May 2018, suspected victims of an emerging Zika outbreak. The cases have gone largely unreported, but an internal World Health Organization report reviewed by Reuters concluded in April that two cases of a potentially dangerous strain of Zika confirmed in early 2017, along with the microcephaly cases identified since then, provided ""strong evidences"" of a Zika-linked microcephaly cluster in Angola. 
(For a graphic on Angola's microcephaly cluster, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ooz66X)
A lack of data and diagnostic testing along with a woefully inadequate Angolan health system has made tracking the outbreak difficult. But new findings from a research team in Portugal suggest it is the first on the African mainland involving the Asian strain of the disease. 
It was the Asian strain that caused at least 3,762 cases of Zika-related birth defects, including microcephaly, in Brazil since 2015, as well as serious outbreaks in other Latin American countries. Doctors and researchers now fear it could spread from Angola to other countries on the African continent. 
In an emailed response to questions, Angola’s ministry of health said it had reports of 41 cases of Zika and 56 cases of microcephaly since January 2017, when it began gathering data. It was not immediately clear why the figures differed from the internal WHO report. 
A lack of testing capacity means many cases of microcephaly go undetected, the ministry added, noting also that microcephaly has many causes. 
“Probably not all the cases of microcephaly can be attributed to Zika,” the ministry said, listing a series of other potential causes such as syphilis and rubella. 
The Angolan outbreak comes at a time when world attention has moved on from Zika, and most of the more than $1 billion in U.S. funding allocated to fight the disease has been spent. 
“We can’t let our attention down on this,” said Eve Lackritz, a physician who leads WHO’s Zika task force. “We have to stay vigilant and have a sustained response.”
Brazil’s epidemic prompted WHO to declare a global public health emergency in February 2016 to investigate and ultimately identify the virus as a cause of microcephaly and other birth defects. Lackritz worries about a sense of complacency now that the crisis in Latin America has waned.
“Our work is just starting,” she said in a telephone interview. “We need continued attention and investment to make sure we protect women and babies of the world.”
She said there is still a great need for better diagnostics, greater lab capacity and programs to monitor birth defects.
Only one laboratory in Angola is currently testing for Zika, according to the health ministry. In order to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, it said laboratories beyond the capital would need to be given testing capacity.  
ZIKA IN AFRICA
First discovered in Uganda's tropical Zika forest in 1947, Zika circulated quietly for years, causing mild, flu-like symptoms in parts of Africa and Asia. Over time, the virus diverged into two genetically distinct lines – the African and the Asian lineages - and neither was initially associated with large epidemics. 
In late 2007, the Asian strain triggered the first large outbreak of Zika in humans on the island of Yap in Micronesia, infecting 73 percent of residents over age 3. In 2013, an outbreak in French Polynesia was the first linked to microcephaly.
The first lab-confirmed case of the Asian strain in Brazil was in 2015. By 2016 the virus, transmitted by the same mosquito that carries dengue and Yellow fever, had spread to nearly all of the states in Brazil, hitting hardest in the tropical Northeast. In its wake, thousands of babies were born with small, misshapen heads.
The African strain of Zika so far has not been linked to microcephaly, which is why health officials are so concerned about the Asian strain’s emergence in Angola, a Portuguese-speaking country that serves as a major travel hub for the rest of Africa.
Some health officials are intrigued by the fact that the only confirmed outbreaks of the Asian strain in Africa so far - in Angola on the continent and in Cape Verde, an island nation off the coast of Senegal - have been in countries that, like Brazil, are Portuguese-speaking. They are probing whether travel ties between Brazil and Portuguese-speaking African nations could have fostered the spread. 
In Angola, it has been difficult to directly link microcephaly cases to Zika because of limited access to advanced testing that can confirm the disease even after the acute phase passes.
Four medical professionals who have worked with Angola’s ministry of health said there was also little political will to investigate a Zika epidemic on the part of a government already dealing with deadly malaria outbreaks, as well as cholera and the potential threat of Ebola spreading from Democratic Republic of the Congo. Speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, they added there was concern that an outbreak would require the government to establish costly programs for babies with microcephaly. 
THE BABIES
In Brazil, the epicenter of the largest and most severe Zika outbreak to date, the virus has now virtually disappeared. The high rate of infections two years ago has left much of the population immune, making it harder for the disease to spread. 
""The saving grace, if there is any saving grace, is that we have herd immunity,"" said Dr. Albert Ko, a tropical disease expert at Yale University. It is not known whether immunity to the African strain also confers immunity to the Asian strain.
Many families affected by the disease still struggle. Jackeline Vieira de Souza, 28, who lives in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, describes a grueling daily routine for her son Daniel, born in 2015 with microcephaly: ""My day to day is to wake up and take care of him. Therapies and doctors."" 
Her hopes for Daniel are modest. 
“I have no dream of seeing him walk, run,"" she said. ""I only dream that … at least he can eat better, breathe better.” 
In Angola, the journey of such mothers is just beginning. There is no public health program to help the children, who need regular physical therapy and other care. 
Families are often referred to The Center for Neurosurgery and Treatment for Hydrocephaly in Luanda, even though the center lacks funding to address the problem. Families are expected to pay for consultations, costing between $7 and $21, which is far beyond the means of many in a country where 30 percent of the population lives on less than $1.90 per day. 
“The majority come once and never come back,” said physiotherapist Adelina Martins. “They don’t have the means to keep coming.” 
On a recent Thursday, Luisa Alberto, 20, waited with her 3-month-old baby to see a doctor with dozens of other mothers sitting in a narrow corridor beneath a portrait of President João Lourenço.  
The baby's father has refused to accept him, and Alberto is caring for her first child alone while trying to finish school. The child feeds but is developing slower than his peers. 
“It's hard,” Alberto said. “He doesn't play like the other babies.”

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, arrived with the gift of much-needed rain and cheer on Wednesday for the rural Australian city of Dubbo, where farmers are struggling with a prolonged drought.
The prince charmed the crowd at a picnic in the town's main park, standing at a podium in pouring rain with Meghan holding an umbrella over him, on the second day of their Pacific tour, which takes in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.
""The rain is a gift!"" Prince Harry told the thousands who had come out to see the royal couple in Dubbo, about 300 km (185 miles) northwest of Sydney.
They had earlier visited a farm hit by the drought and Harry recalled his own stay on an Australian farm 15 years ago, where he said he was chased by countless cattle and perfected the Aussie salute of swatting flies.
""You are the salt of the earth. Honest, hard-working, and as tough as they come,"" Harry said. 
In an issue close to his heart, he urged those facing mental health problems due to the tough times plaguing rural Australia to seek help.
""You are all in this together and, if I may say, personally, we are all in this together - because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better,"" he said to cheers and applause. 
The royal couple's visit to Australia coincides with the Invictus Games in Sydney from Oct. 20-27. The games, founded by Harry, are an international paralympic-style event that aims to lift the spirits of wounded military veterans.
A 5-year-old boy earlier stole the show in a long line of school children who met the royals at Dubbo airport.
Luke Vincent, who has Down Syndrome and adores Santa Claus, threw his arms around Meghan when she knelt down to greet him and tugged at Harry's beard and patted him on the head when the prince hugged the boy.
Meghan, who is expecting the royal couple's first child in the northern spring, wore skinny black jeans, a white shirt, long gray jacket and black boots with her hair tied back in a pony tail.
Prince Harry and Meghan, on their first international tour since marrying in May, also visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Dubbo.

The medical service was anointed as ""royal"" in 1955 after Queen Elizabeth, Harry's grandmother, visited Australia.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2018 12:53AM ET</span>",Indian state won't ease crackdown on crime despite Apple manager's death,"By Krishna N. Das
LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Private security guard Ajit Singh Rana says he supports a police crackdown on gangsters in India's most populous state, even after cops gunned down an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) executive at a road stop in what human rights activists say was the latest in a series of extra-judicial killings.
Police have said the shooting was an accident, but are adamant there will be no let-up in the anti-crime campaign, which is popular with many people in India's most politically important state.
""Goons and criminals have held back the state for years,"" said Rana, 31, who guards a river-front park in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow in the evening and is the supervisor of a group of street cleaners in the morning.
""The government is right in killing them and everyone here appreciates it,"" he said.
Uttar Pradesh, in India's north, is home to 220 million people and sends more lawmakers to the lower house of parliament than any other state. 
It is run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a saffron robe-wearing Hindu priest, launched a ""zero-tolerance"" fight against criminals months after taking office in March last year.
Since then police have killed 67 suspected criminals in more than 2,700 ""engagements"", wounded 700 and arrested 6,500, according to the draft of a government report reviewed by Reuters. Four policemen died and about 500 officers were injured in the incidents.
Adityanath's state government has been boasting about the success of the crackdown and claims it has reduced major crimes significantly.
In the first nine months of this year, reported cases of murder fell 4 percent, rape 8 percent, burglary 11 percent, extortion 35 percent and robbery 40 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a government document reviewed by Reuters. 
""This will benefit Modi and Yogi, 100 percent. I will vote for them again, 100 percent,"" said Rana.
Rana's colleague Damodar Singh, 34, said he also approved of the tough stance but added crime won't end as long as there's a big jobless problem.
Opposition parties and rights activists say that as farm distress and high unemployment dent the BJP's popularity in the country, the Adityanath government is playing to the basest fears of the electorate about their safety and security.
FIRED ACCIDENTALLY
The Apple executive, Vivek Tiwari, was stopped by two police constables on motorcycle patrol near Lucknow early on the morning of Sept. 29, and shot dead. One of the constables told reporters he fired accidentally at Tiwari, who was driving back from an iPhone store launch.
In an attempt to defuse the wave of criticism, Uttar Pradesh offered the widow a state government job and compensation for the death of her husband. Police also issued a rare public apology.
But that hasn't stopped activists and opposition politicians from demanding the state government rein in ""trigger-happy"" police. They say Tiwari's killing garnered attention because he was a high-caste Hindu and worked for a high-profile company but the deaths of minority Muslims and poor people at the hands of the police rarely get a public airing.
Adityanath's aides and police officers, however, told Reuters that security forces would continue to operate without fear or political interference as they needed to improve the law and order situation to attract more investment.
""The Lucknow incident has given us a setback, made us hang our heads in shame,"" Anand Kumar, the second highest police official in Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters. ""But it really was an aberration and we are resilient enough to bounce back. In this state we can't let our guard down.""
He said that courts in the state had cleared police of any wrongdoing in more than half of the so-called ""encounter"" deaths; that investigations were ongoing in other cases; and that 95 percent of the dead criminals had a bounty on their heads. Kumar said the perception of the state was changing from ""no go"" to ""go go"".
It is difficult to estimate the impact of the hardline strategy on next year's national election, due to be held by May, given law and order will be only one of the issues amid concerns about weak farm incomes and job creation.
An opinion poll by Times Now TV channel in August said Modi's BJP would see its parliamentary seats from Uttar Pradesh fall to 49 from 73 in 2014. There are 80 seats altogether from the state.
State BJP leaders say they will win more seats than in 2014. Sanjeev Singh, a BJP politician who is now in the state government as an officer on special duty to Adityanath, said ""change is visible"" to the common man and that should benefit the party politically.
NO BIAS
Ten Hindu voters Reuters spoke with during visits to Lucknow and Shamli, a district near the site of several of the killings, said they backed the clampdown while half a dozen Muslims - who make up just 19 percent of the state's population - said they felt it was mainly targeting them.
Kumar, an additional director general of police, said there was no bias against any community or caste. He said 22 of the suspected criminals killed were Muslims, while the other 45 were Hindus. 
But rights activists say the BJP government is allowing police to take the law into its own hands.
""Evidence points to use of encounters as a means to instill fear in the minds of criminals, and to raise the image of the state government and the police, in the public eye, as being tough on crime and criminals,"" said Citizens Against Hate, a civil society alliance, in a report in May.
The report said the alliance had found at least 17 cases of suspected extra-judicial executions, based on interviews with victims' families and analyses of police complaints and medical reports.
Showing a stamp size photo of his son's body stitched up from the front after a post-mortem examination, Meer Hasan said he hoped trouble for his family would end with the police killing of the eldest of his nine sons, Furquan.
Hasan, a Muslim, said in an affidavit to a court in western Uttar Pradesh that 37-year-old Furquan was with his cousin and a friend on the evening of Oct. 22 last year when police officers seized and beat them. Furquan, his father told Reuters, had been out on bail in connection with a village land dispute case.
He said the same night they were taken away to a jungle where Furquan was shot dead in a ""fake encounter"" - a deliberately staged police shootout - while his two companions were wounded in the legs and taken into custody. Hasan said his court statement was based on what his son's two companions said happened.
Police told the court that Furquan was a ""dreaded"" criminal with a bounty of 50,000 rupees on his head for offences including rioting, carrying deadly weapons without a license and unlawful assembly.
According to the police version of events, a group of five men on two motorcycles fired at officers when asked to stop at a checkpoint. In the ensuing shootout, two policemen were wounded and Furquan was killed.
In January, the court dismissed Hasan's petition seeking an investigation into the killing.
Hasan said he would not pursue the case any further.

""Whatever had to happen with Furquan happened,"" Hasan, 68, said sitting outside his run-down red brick house in his village in Shamli. ""I hope my other boys stay safe. I hope they live.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The chair of a United Nations inquiry that accused Myanmar's military of genocide is likely to brief the Security Council this month after Britain, France, the United States and six other members requested the meeting, diplomats said on Tuesday.
The move comes as global pressure mounts on Myanmar to act on accountability after a Myanmar military crackdown in the western state of Rakhine last year drove some 700,000 of the largely stateless minority over the border into Bangladesh.
The crackdown followed attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts. Myanmar has denied committing atrocities against the Rohingya, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants.
The U.N. inquiry's report, released in August, called for the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, impose targeted sanctions and set up an ad hoc tribunal to try suspects or refer them to the International Criminal Court.
Diplomats say council veto powers China and Russia are likely to protect Myanmar from any push for such measures.
However, they cannot block the briefing on the U.N. report because a minimum nine of the 15 council members support the move, which cannot be vetoed. Diplomats say China and Russia believe the report should first be addressed by the U.N. General Assembly's Third Committee, which deals with human rights. 
The letter requesting the briefing was signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Peru, Kuwait, Ivory Coast and the United States. 
Myanmar's U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan wrote to the Security Council on Tuesday to object to the chair of the inquiry being invited to brief the body, warning that it ""will only exacerbate mistrust and polarization among different communities in Rakhine"" state, where the military crackdown occurred.
""Putting accountability above all else without regard to other positive developments is a dangerous attempt that will face utter failure,"" he wrote.
The U.N. inquiry, established by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, said the military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent."" Myanmar rejected the findings as ""one-sided"" and said it was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
The European Union is considering trade sanctions on Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis, potentially stripping the country of tariff-free access to the world's largest trading bloc, three EU officials said earlier this month. The EU has already imposed travel bans and asset freezes on several military members.
The United States imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units in August. New sanctions are under consideration for half a dozen other individuals and at least two military-run businesses, U.S. officials have said.
""Unilateral coercive measures without regard to the situation in Myanmar and imposition of politically motivated external pressure will be detrimental to the existing good will and cooperation of the Myanmar Government with the international community,"" Myanmar's U.N. envoy wrote to the Security Council. 

Separately, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has begun examining allegations of forced deportation of Rohingya to Bangladesh. Myanmar has said it wants to repatriate Rohingya who fled.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's federal police have asked the supreme court to indict President Michel Temer and confiscate his assets and those of some of his close associates over alleged graft, according to a copy of its report for the court, seen by Reuters on Tuesday. 
Police have been investigating Temer for allegedly taking bribes in return for helping shape a decree regulating Brazil's ports, and in particular for extending concessions in the port of Santos to benefit companies of close associates. 
Temer, a former vice president who took office in 2016 after former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, has repeatedly said he is innocent. He has faced several graft allegations, but is immune from prosecution while in office, unless the supreme court decides to strip his immunity. 
Supreme Court Justice Lugs Roberto Barroso, who is overseeing the case, said on Tuesday he would wait to see the findings of Brazil's public prosecutors office before deciding on how to proceed. 
The report produced by the federal police recommends that Temer, his daughter Maristela, his former advisor Rodrigo Rocha Loures and eight others face charges and have their assets confiscated for their role in allegedly laundering bribes through real estate transactions.
Temer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His term ends on Jan. 1, and with it his immunity from prosecution.

The federal congress voted twice last year to block Temer from standing trial in the Supreme Court on three corruption charges leveled against him.

KABUL (Reuters) - More female candidates than ever are set to contest Afghanistan's upcoming parliamentary election, braving violence and opposition from social conservatives in a campaign seen as a test of the war-torn nation's democratic institutions.
""Elections in my country are not just about victory or defeat,"" said Dewa Niazai, a 26 year-old candidate from the eastern province of Nangarhar, who holds a degree in computer science from India. ""It is about launching a small-scale war. I can get killed, injured or abducted."" 
Niazai is one of the 417 women candidates contesting seats across the country, despite deadly suicide attacks on election rallies and offices apparently aimed at forcing voters to boycott the vote scheduled for Oct. 20.
She says she wants to be a voice for uneducated women who are not represented in parliament and to defend girls' rights to education - Islamic State has blown up several girls' schools in her Nangarhar constituency.
The growing involvement of women has been welcomed by the United Nations and other international bodies, which see the elections as a vital step in building trust in democratic processes.
Campaigning is fraught with risks regardless of gender. Nine candidates, including one woman, have been killed in separate attacks. Another two have been abducted, and four others have been wounded by hardline Islamist militants, election officials said.
Last week a blast at an election rally of a woman candidate in the northeastern province of Takhar killed 22 people and wounded 35.
Nazifa Yousuf Bek, the female candidate, was standing about 10 meters away when the explosion occurred.
""My supporters were waiting to listen to my speech but in a few seconds I was surrounded by their bodies,"" the 32-year-old teacher told Reuters. ""I am shaken but I am also determined to continue the election campaign. This is my responsibility.""
INSECURITY AND HARASSMENT
For women, there are additional challenges, said Maria Bashir, Afghanistan's first female prosecutor from Herat province, who like other women candidates interviewed by Reuters had until recently never seriously contemplated entering politics.
""In comparison with male candidates, women have more problems in the election race ... insecurity and harassment inhibit women's mobility and justify family restrictions,"" she said.
Echoing other women candidates who spoke to Reuters, Bashir says she is standing for election after growing dismayed with the direction of the country, starting with the failure of the government to improve security or safeguard women's rights.
Unable to hold open rallies because of security concerns, Bashir invites voters to attend political discussions at her home, and travels around the city at night to distribute publicity pamphlets and encourage voters to cast their ballot.
Sabri Andar, the only female candidate with disabilities, is contesting a seat in Kabul. She said her main focus would be on ensuring rights legislation was not ignored.
""Laws about equality exist on paper but they are yet to implemented,"" she said. ""As a lawmaker I want to ensure we practice what is written in our constitution.""
Women's rights advocates say that, despite the heavy emphasis placed on promoting equality by international donors, age-old scourges such as child marriage or the murder of women by family members in so-called ""honor killings"" remain rife. Afghan girls still routinely receive less schooling than boys.
SOCIAL TABOOS
Under the constitution written after the austere rule of the Taliban was ended by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in 2001, at least 68 of the 250 seats in the lower house of parliament are reserved for women. The quota means that Afghanistan fares better in a simple measure of female representation in the legislature than some Western nations - 28 percent of seats in the lower house are currently held by women, 8 points higher than the U.S. Congress.
But female candidates campaigning in their constituencies say Afghanistan's patriarchal culture means they face a battle to be heard even if they win.
""We are trained to dress in a way that is acceptable to men, we talk in a way that does not anger men and, in politics, we are expected to appease them to stay relevant,"" said Masooda Jalal, a former minister of women's affairs.
As well as facing sexual harassment, a regular problem that is rarely discussed openly because of strict social taboos, many women MPs complain they are not taken seriously by their male counterparts.
Women in positions of authority said they were often perceived as puppets who can procure funds from international aid groups committed to promoting gender equality.
Rights group activists in Kabul said more than three dozen bills drafted to strengthen the existing laws to safeguard the rights of millions of Afghan women were pending before the parliament but have not been allotted time for debate.
Nasrullah Stanekzai, a political science professor at Kabul University and a former legal advisor to President Ashraf Ghani said ethnic, religious, political and financial loyalties of female candidate limit their role.

""Females candidates win elections with the help of powerful male politicians who in turn expects them to work as stooges in the parliament, rarely allowing them to have an independent opinion,"" said Stanekzai.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison could face a backlash in a by-election this weekend as voters in a once-safe seat weigh whether to strip the conservative government of its one-seat parliamentary majority.
The Saturday by-election in Sydney's diverse, affluent Wentworth constituency is the first major test of Morrison's standing with voters, many of whom are angry over the ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in August following a backbench revolt.
Wentworth was Turnbull's seat. He quit politics days after his removal.
If the government were to lose the seat, Morrison would have to try to strike a deal with a handful of independents to govern with a minority, or be forced into an early general election. 
Morrison's Liberal Party won the seat by a 17.7 percent margin in the last election in 2016 but polls indicate it will be a tight race.
""There are plenty of angry voters and there will be a significant protest vote over the treatment of Turnbull and the government's climate polices, which is the dominant issue,"" John Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal Party and a former MP for Wentworth, told Reuters.
""It really is a 50-50 race.""
Australians mark their ballot papers in order of their candidate preference. If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes given to the second preference candidate. This continues until one candidate wins.
JERUSALEM QUESTION
With the by-election too close to call, Morrison on Tuesday moved to win favor with the electorate's large Jewish community by announcing he was considering moving Australia's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
According to census data, 13 percent of Wentworth's electorate is Jewish, and Morrison said the idea had been advanced by Dave Sharma, a former Australian ambassador to Israel and now Liberal Party candidate for Wentworth.
Sharma denied that the proposal to move the embassy was related to the by-election. He also said he strongly supported ""the emergence of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state, living alongside Israel in peace"".
Stretching from Bondi Beach to Sydney's harbor, the Liberal Party's economic credentials have traditionally been the dominant lure for most voters.
While the scores of ocean view mansions provide evidence of the electorate's wealth, it also belies Wentworth's progressive voter base.
More than 80 percent of the electorate voted for same-sex marriage last year, well ahead of the national average, while many in the area also want to reject fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy.
While nearly two-thirds of voters backed Turnbull in 2016, this time, Wentworth looks set to be a referendum on Morrison, a staunch conservative and supporter of the coal industry.
Should voters reject the government, Morrison will be left with a choice of either trying to form a minority government or calling an early election while trailing in the polls.
Bob Katter, one of two former ruling party members who are now independents in parliament who the government will mostly likely have to rely on to get any legislation through, warned he would exact a high price for his support.

    ""It's not for me to call it a threat but when I don't get a fair go, then it is mayhem time,"" said Katter, who declined to specify what exactly he would demand.

After an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit Indonesia's coastal city of Palu, a pile of broken pink concrete is all that remains of fruit vendor Kaharuddin's home. 
He stared quietly at the rubble in his hometown of Balaroa, saying it concealed the body of his one-year-old daughter, who was among the hundreds missing after the Sept. 28 disaster.
""I'm just waiting here and hope that I can find my child,"" said Kaharuddin, 40, who goes by one name, like many Indonesians. ""Or maybe I have to accept that one will have to remain buried here.""
Four days after the quake, he said, rescue workers found the remains of his wife, Hastuti, still holding in her arms the bodies of their other two daughters, aged four and two.  
As many as 5,000 people may still be buried under the mud, disaster relief officials estimate. Indonesia called off the search for victims on Friday, two weeks after the quake, citing health concerns, despite residents' pleas to continue.
(For accompanying package, click https://reut.rs/2EpgTl9) 
The town in the province of central Sulawesi was among those hardest hit by the phenomenon of ground liquefaction, when the shaking earth turns soft, damp soil into a roiling quagmire, dragging thousands of houses and people under mud and asphalt.
The destructive waves of soil smashed thousands of homes, cars and buildings into each other, carrying some of them hundreds of meters from their original position within minutes.
""It felt like the earth was alive,"" said Darmi, 48, who saw half of her two-storey home collapse. ""It was opening up, swallowing people, and then closing again. And the noise was so loud. This loud cracking ‘k-k-k-k’ sound."" 
Returning to Balaroa for the first time two weeks after the disaster, Hesti Andayani, 27, was shocked to find her childhood home had slid downhill, far from its original location.
""It took so long to find,"" she said, through tears. ""I don’t know where we can live now.""
Hesti, who lost her younger sister in the quake, sat on a pile of tiles that once covered part of her second-floor bedroom, surrounded by dusty jewelry and cosmetics.
""These are all the things I have left. My makeup, my necklaces, the pins for my hijab,"" she sobbed, referring to the headgear worn by devout Muslim women.
Searchers arrived with dozens of excavators to help dig out bodies, while some residents made frequent trips to retrieve treasured belongings from the rubble of destroyed homes.
Government district officer Yassir Garibaldi, 43, pushed and pulled at a white car stuck under a collapsed porch.
""I bought this car for my parents,"" he said. ""They’re gone now but it's still a good car. It's the only thing of theirs I can recover.""
He was forced to watch helplessly as his parents and niece suffocated to death after the quake trapped them in a concrete hole flooded with water. 
""I found them the morning after the earthquake,"" Yassir said.
""I managed to speak with them, even gave them some water to drink. But they were crushed against each other, and the water must have been cold. After a while, they just stopped breathing.""
Others must reconcile themselves to the loss of loved ones.
In Petobo, about 12 km (7.5 miles) away, Ameriyah, 56, lost three of her children, a grandchild and a son-in-law. She has accepted it is unlikely that searchers will now uncover their remains.
""We've held funeral prayers for them, so we hope their souls will be at peace,"" she said.
Some remain inconsolable. 

""I don't know what to do next. There's nothing left for me here,"" said Kaharuddin, the fruit vendor still looking for his daughter's body under the pink concrete rubble of their former home.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Protesting Cuban and Bolivian diplomats shouted, chanted and banged their hands on desks at the United Nations on Tuesday to drown out the launch of a U.S. campaign on the plight of Cuban political prisoners.
U.S. envoy to the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Kelley Currie persisted, delivering her remarks in the ECOSOC chamber, followed by several other speakers, including Secretary General of the Organization of American States Luis Almagro.
""I have never in my life seen diplomats behave the way that the Cuban delegation did today. It was really shocking and disturbing,"" Currie told reporters. 
""You can understand very well why people feel afraid to speak their minds ... with this kind of government, this kind of thuggish behavior,"" she said. ""It has no place here in the United Nations.""
During the meeting, the protesting diplomats chanted ""Cuba si, bloqueo no (Cuba yes, blockade no)!"" in protest against a decades-old U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island nation that President Donald Trump has tightened. 
Cuban U.N. Ambassador Anayansi Rodríguez Camejo protested to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ahead of the event, and on Tuesday she described the event as a ""political comedy."" 
""Cuba is proud of its human rights record, which denies any manipulation against it,"" she told reporters. ""On the contrary, the U.S. lacks the morals to give lessons, much less in this matter."" 
The United States said in a statement that is estimates there are 130 political prisoners held by the Cuban government. The campaign it launched on Tuesday was called ""Jailed for What?""
""The imprisonment of children would have rightly justified the name 'Jailed for What?'"" said Camejo, referring to the U.S. policy of separating and detaining children and parents who have entered the United States illegally. ""This is a shame for the United States government.""
The Cuban government maintains it does not have any political prisoners, and characterizes Cuba's small but vocal dissident community as mercenaries paid by U.S. interests to destabilize the government.

ECOSOC is responsible for coordinating the economic, social and related work of 15 U.N. specialized agencies, their commissions and five regional commissioners.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday allowed the Palestinians to act more like a full U.N. member state during meetings in 2019 when they will chair the group of 77 developing nations.
The United States, Israel and Australia voted against the move, which won 146 votes in favor. There were 15 abstentions and 29 countries didn't vote. 
""We cannot support efforts by the Palestinians to enhance their status outside of direct negotiations. The United States does not recognize that there is a Palestinian state,"" U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the General Assembly.
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally.
""We strongly oppose the Palestinians' election as chair of the G77 as well as this so-called enabling resolution,"" he said. ""Only U.N. member states should be entitled to speak and act on behalf of major groups of states at the United Nations.""
In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine when it upgraded the Palestinian Authority's U.N. observer status to non-member state - like the Vatican - from entity.
The status upgrade has allowed them to participate in some General Assembly votes and join some international bodies. However, as a non-member state the Palestinians cannot speak in meetings until after member states, diplomats said.
The Egyptian-drafted resolution allows them to procedurally operate like a member state when acting on behalf of the G77 and China - making statements, submitting and co-sponsoring proposals and amendments, giving rights of reply and raising points of order.

""Australia's decision to vote no on this resolution reflects our long-standing position that Palestinian attempts to seek recognition as a state in international fora are deeply unhelpful to efforts toward a two-state solution,"" Australian U.N. Ambassador Gillian Bird told the General Assembly.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 04:28PM ET</span>",Immigrant caravan organizer detained after Trump threatens Honduras,"By Doina Chiacu and Jorge Cabrera
WASHINGTON/ESQUIPULAS, Guatemala (Reuters) - The organizer of a migrant caravan from Honduras was detained on Tuesday in Guatemala after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw funding and aid from Honduras if the flow of migrants north to the United States was not stopped.
Guatemalan police officers detained Bartolo Fuentes, a former member of the Honduran Congress, from the middle of a large crowd he and three other organizers had led from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, since Saturday, bound for Mexico.
The Honduran security ministry said Fuentes was detained because he ""did not comply with Guatemalan immigration rules"" and would be deported back to Honduras in the coming hours.
Up to 3,000 migrants, according to organizers' estimates, crossed from Honduras into Guatemala on Monday on a trek northward, after a standoff with Guatemalan police in riot gear and warnings from Washington that migrants should not try to enter the United States illegally. 
Guatemala's government has not given official figures for how many migrants are in the group.
""The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
It was Trump's latest effort to demonstrate his administration's tough stance on immigration.
The message was driven home by Vice President Mike Pence, who wrote in a tweet that he had spoken to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.
""Delivered strong message from @POTUS: no more aid if caravan is not stopped. Told him U.S. will not tolerate this blatant disregard for our border & sovereignty,"" Pence tweeted.
The move could further encourage Honduras to move closer to China because of what the Central American country sees as weak U.S. support, amid intensified efforts by Beijing to win recognition from Central American countries currently aligned with Taiwan.
Hernandez said last month that cuts in U.S. support for Central America would hinder efforts to stem illegal immigration. He welcomed China’s growing diplomatic presence in the region as an ""opportunity."" 
In an interview with Reuters, Hernandez lamented that prior U.S. commitments to step up investment in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador had been scaled back since Trump took office.
Honduras is one of a dwindling number of countries that still have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, an island nation off the Chinese coast that Beijing views as a renegade province.
Last week, Pence told Central American countries the United States was willing to help with economic development and investment if they did more to tackle mass migration, corruption and gang violence. Thousands of migrants have left the impoverished region in recent years.
GROWING GROUP
The current group making their way north plan to seek refugee status in Mexico or pass through to the United States, saying they are fleeing poverty and violence.
The group more than doubled in size from Saturday, when it set off from northern Honduras in what has been dubbed ""March of the Migrant,"" an organizer said. 
""What Trump says doesn't interest us,"" organizer Fuentes said in an interview shortly before his detention. ""These people are fleeing. These people are not tourists.""
He was traveling with hoards of men, women and children, packs in hand, walking northward on a Guatemalan highway about 55 miles (89 km) from the border with Honduras. 
Widespread violence and poverty prompt thousands of Central Americans, mainly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, to make the arduous journey north toward Mexico and the United States in search of a better life.
Guatemala said in a statement on Sunday that it did not promote or endorse ""irregular migration."" Guatemalan police initially blocked migrants from reaching a customs booth, Reuters images showed.
Trump ran for president in 2016 on promises to toughen U.S. immigration policies and build a wall along the 2,000-mile(3,220-km) border with Mexico. 

Illegal immigration is likely to be a top issue in Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, when Democrats are seen as having a good chance of gaining control of the House of Representatives from Trump's fellow Republicans.

The Guards said in a statement published on state media their forces had killed a man named Abu Zaha and four other militants in Diyala province in Iraq. One news website run by Iran's state television said Abu Zaha was a member of Islamic State.
Both Islamic State and an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement called the Ahwaz National Resistance, which seeks a separate state in Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, have claimed responsibility for the Sept. 22 attack. Neither group has provided conclusive evidence to back up its claim.
On Oct. 1, Iran said it had killed several Islamic State leaders in eastern Syria in a missile strike and destroyed the militants' supplies and infrastructure.
The Sunni Muslim Islamic State group, in decline in Iraq and Syria, considers the majority Shi'ite Muslims of Iran to be heretics.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said those responsible for the parade attack were paid by Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and that Iran will “severely punish” those behind the violence.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE have denied involvement in the attack.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>","In rare campaign for Cuba, churches advocate against gay marriage","By Nelson Acosta and Sarah Marsh
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban evangelical churches are collecting signatures to petition against a proposed constitutional amendment that would open the door to gay marriage, as part of an unusually strong non-governmental political campaign for the Communist-run island.
Cubans have been discussing the broader revamp of their Soviet-era constitution, as proposed by the Communist Party, at official block-level meetings nationwide since August.
Article 68, which redefines matrimony as gender neutral, has sparked a particular uproar, revealing how macho Cuban society remains despite making headway on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in recent years.
Cuba's churches, which enjoy more autonomy and influence than any other organization not affiliated with the Communist Party after the country expanded religious freedoms in the 1990s, have been stoking the controversy.
""We do not in any way approve Article 68 ... because the Bible condemns it,"" Pastor Lester Fernandez, 39, said to euphoric applause from around 500 people gathered at a Methodist Church in Havana one weekday morning earlier this month.
The Methodist Church is one of 21 evangelical denominations that this month started gathering signatures for a petition against the amendment.
They have also been plastering posters celebrating the ""original family design, just as God created it"" on their doors and windows, surprising many Cubans in a one-party country with tight control of public spaces.
Some analysts say the focus on gay marriage is crowding out discussion of other, more sensitive issues raised by the constitutional revamp, which maintains Cuba's one-party socialist system as ""irrevocable"" while reflecting changes of recent years in its 224 articles.
""(Gay marriage) has functioned as a smokescreen to hide other realities,"" said Isbel Diaz Torres, an activist for many issues, including LGBT rights.
Diaz Torres said he would be happy to finally be able to marry his boyfriend of 14 years if the constitution were approved and the necessary legal changes made.
But he wished Cubans would use the public consultation to address other issues like human rights.
The consultation has provoked an unusually open debate for Cuba, with some citizens, for example, calling for direct elections for president. Yet some topics, like the possibility of another political or economic system, appear to remain off-limits.
HALF A MILLION SIGNATURES?
Cuba persecuted gays in the early decades of Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, as it did religious people, rounding them up as counter-revolutionaries and placing them in labor camps.
Castro apologized in 2010 for this, and the country has made strides in LGBT rights in recent years, thanks partly to the advocacy of his niece, Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education (CENESEX). Fidel Castro died in 2016.
If the constitution were approved with Article 68 in place, Cuba would be on track to joining Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay in allowing same-sex couples to marry.
Given that it already guarantees other LGBT rights like free sex-change operations, this would make it an unlikely regional leader in LGBT rights, particularly in the Caribbean where homophobia is rife and some countries still have anti-sodomy laws.
However, the government has promised to take into account public suggestions for a final version to be put to a referendum early next year.
Cuban Evangelical League Church President Alida Leon Baez said she expected more than 500,000 Cubans to sign the churches' petition.
Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of Cuba's 11.2 million citizens are baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, which has not weighed in on Article 68, but traditionally opposes same-sex marriage.
""If the topic of matrimony is not modified in the constitutional project, we will all vote against it,"" said Leon Baez. ""If this is approved, our nation is going to total destruction."" 
This could put the government in a bind if it wants to prove the public consultation is a real example of participatory democracy, and not, as some opponents say, a fraud.
Cuban LGBT activists have run a countercampaign mainly on social media. But they complain the government does not officially recognize most independent activists and occasionally harasses them.
That means they, unlike Cuba's churches, cannot do big campaigns.

""CENESEX is doing many actions,"" said LGBT activist Ulises Padron. ""But we can't forget at the end of the day it's an academic, scientific, teaching institution.""

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Another 10 people in Florida have been confirmed dead in the wake of Hurricane Michael, bringing the number of storm-related deaths to at least 29 as rescue workers try to reach hundreds more people whose whereabouts are unknown.
Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States, has killed 20 people in the Florida Panhandle, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to official tallies. 
Teams from volunteer rescue organization CrowdSource Rescue were steadily making contact with people flagged by friends and relatives in the Panhandle disaster zone, according to Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based group. Volunteers still had not reached more than 1,135 people on Tuesday morning.
As cellphone service returned, the number of people unaccounted for in Mexico Beach, one of the hardest-hit towns, dropped to three, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. 
""Hopefully, they left and we'll find them safe somewhere,"" he said, before heading to a clean-up effort where workers awaited the arrival of some overdue portable toilets. 
""This type of living wears on you,"" Putnal said. ""This is about my fifth day and I'm just not used to washing clothes in a tub with no washer and dryer and eating only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.""
The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. Rescue workers were using dogs to find any bodies that might be buried under the debris.
More than 200,000 people remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. 
At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. 
CAMPING IN TENTS
Countless residents in the region's backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.
""I'm staying out here to try to keep away looters, to try to save what I can save,"" said Bernard Sutton, a 64-year-old cancer patient, who has been living out of a tent and broken-down minivan. 
Downed trees hampered access to those stranded by the storm.
The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, according to Governor Rick Scott's office.
Water supply was restored to some residents in Panama City on Monday but Bay County officials said it was not yet safe to drink.
Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle last week with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour).
The winds and storm surge caused $6 billion to $10 billion in insured losses, risk modeler AIR Worldwide said. Those figures exclude uninsured property or losses paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program, AIR Worldwide said.

U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the storm-affected areas on Monday, distributing bottles of water at an aid center in Lynn Haven, a city of about 18,500 people near Panama City.

The Senate alleges NNPC used the fund to subside the price of imported petrol without the house's approval, the lawmakers said.
Fuel subsidies are a contentious issue in Nigeria, where prices are kept artificially low at 145 naira ($0.48) per litre, often as a populist tool.
That has meant that as fuel prices increase globally, it has become unprofitable for private petrol marketers to import, forcing NNPC to step in to prevent major shortages. 
However, state oil firm money spent on subsidies is meant to be included in Nigeria's national budget, subject to approval by the national assembly.
The Senate President, Bukola Saraki, said parliament would set up a committee to look into the issue.
A spokesman for NNPC said the oil company would await a decision from lawmakers and then decide how to respond. 
""We have to call for the resolution (by the Senate), analyse it and respond accordingly,"" he said.
In April, the Senate said the state oil firm illegally paid 216 billion naira ($707 million) in fuel subsidies in 2017, which should be reimbursed to the government.

Fuel shortages are a recurrent issue in Nigeria's energy sector due to the country's limited refining base and its cap on prices. This often creates long queues lasting hours at petrol stations whenever there is talk of fuel price increases.

LONDON (Reuters) - At least 10 Iranian security personnel including Revolutionary Guards were kidnapped on the border with Pakistan on Tuesday, Iran's state media reported, and a separatist group said it had seized them as revenge for the oppression of Sunni Muslims. 
The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's top security force, said in a statement carried on state television that some of its members had been abducted by a militant group at a border post in the city of Mirjaveh in Sistan-Baluchestan province.
Iranian officials held talks with the Pakistani ambassador in Tehran and called on Islamabad to ""use all possible means"" to free them. 
The Guards did not say how many were kidnapped, but state news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed official as saying 14 people had been kidnapped around 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.
The Guards said they believed the Iranian forces had been deceived by ""insiders"", but did not elaborate. Fars news agency said there were reports Iranian forces had been poisoned by food before being captured and taken to Pakistan.
Ebrahim Azizi, spokesman for Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group, said the group had seized more than 10 people.
""This morning Jaish al-Adl forces attacked a border post in Mirjaveh, and captured all their weapons,"" Azizi said in an audio message sent to Reuters.
The group also claimed responsibility on its Twitter account.
Azizi said the attack was retaliation for what he called the Iranian state's oppression of Sunnis in Sistan-Baluchestan, a mainly Sunni province with a long history of separatist unrest.
SAFE HAVENS?
Iran's Shi'ite Muslim authorities say militant groups operate from safe havens in Pakistan.
Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Fars new agency the Pakistani ambassador had attended a meeting in the ministry. Iran asked Islamabad to ""use all possible means, without any delay"" to free those abducted.
The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement: ""We expect Pakistan to confront these terrorist groups that are supported by some regional states, and immediately release the kidnapped Iranian forces."" 
Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""Both militaries, under a joint mechanism established since last year, are working to ascertain the whereabouts of Iranian guards.""
In previous cases of cross-border clashes, Iran threatened to hit militant bases in Pakistan unless Islamabad took action. 
But this time Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour, the head of the Guards' ground forces, said Iran was ready to conduct ""joint military operations with Pakistan"" against the militant groups to release the kidnapped personnel.
Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of funding separatist groups on its territory. Riyadh has denied any involvement in Iranian internal affairs.
In September, the Revolutionary Guards killed four Sunni militants at a border crossing with Pakistan, including the second-in-command of Jaish al-Adl.

Tensions between the neighbors have risen as Rome has accused Paris of hypocrisy by refusing to take in a fair share of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have reached Italy by boat since 2014.
On Friday, witnesses reported seeing a French police van cross the mountain border at Claviere, near the Italian ski resort of Sestriere, and making two black men get out in a wooded area before driving back the short distance to France. 
Italy demanded explanations from France and on Monday French media quoted the head of the Hautes-Alpes region that flanks Italy as acknowledging that its police had crossed the border, calling the incursion ""an error"".
Salvini, who serves as interior minister and is also head of the far-right League, dismissed the explanation and demanded to know the identities of the two men, who he said were migrants.
""What happened in Claviere represents an unprecedented offence against our country,"" Salvini wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""We are facing an international disgrace, and (French President Emmanuel) Macron can not pretend nothing has happened.""
Macron has denounced Salvini's anti-immigrant policies, telling reporters in August that he represented the ""main opponent"" in Europe to nationalists like Salvini.
In June, a spokesman for Macron's party said Salvini's moves to block charity rescue ships from docking in Italy ""makes me vomit"".
Salvini wrote on Facebook: ""I wonder if international organizations, starting with the United Nations and European Union, do not find it vomit-making to leave people in an isolated area, without any assistance."" 
He added, ""Paris must inform us IMMEDIATELY the identities of the immigrants left in the woods. Names, surnames, nationalities, dates of birth.""
Alongside his comment was a photo of Macron with a bright, red face and the text: ""International shame. Italy won't accept apologies.""

Many migrants reaching Italy head straight to wealthier nations further north. However, under EU rules they are meant to apply for asylum in Italy and not allowed to move to a third country. France has policed its borders increasingly vigorously, and looks to return to Italy any irregular migrants.

RIYADH/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince agreed on Tuesday there must be a thorough investigation into the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the United States said, after media reports that Riyadh will acknowledge he was killed in a botched interrogation.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and leading critic of the crown prince, vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed, which the Saudis strongly deny.
Overnight, Turkish crime scene investigators entered the consulate for the first time since Khashoggi's disappearance and searched the premises for over nine hours.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh amid strained ties with its close ally, speculated that ""rogue killers"" may be responsible.
Pompeo met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the incident, which has sparked international outrage and brought renewed attention on the authoritarian kingdom's human rights record.
He and Prince Mohammed ""agreed on the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation"", a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said in Washington.
A Trump administration official said although Washington had a significant relationship with Riyadh ""that doesn't mean we're in any way ignoring or downplaying this episode"". Those responsible must be held accountable, he said.
Pompeo is expected to go on to Turkey after dinner with the crown prince.
PAINTING OVER
In Istanbul, Turkish investigators were expanding their search to include the Saudi consul's residence and consulate vehicles, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan raised the possibility that parts of the consulate had been repainted since Khashoggi disappeared.
""The investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,"" he told reporters.
A Turkish security source said the overnight search of the consulate had provided ""strong evidence"" but no conclusive proof that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. 
""However, there are some findings and they are being worked on,"" he said.
Despite the outcry, the case poses a dilemma for the United States, Britain and other Western nations. Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil exporter and spends lavishly on Western arms. It is also a military ally and an opponent of Iran. 
Riyadh has also faced criticism from some Western politicians and human right groups over the civilian casualties its war planes have caused in the war in Yemen, in which it intervened three years ago.
Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, but ruled out cancelling arms deals worth tens of billions of dollars.
Indicating unease over the Khashoggi case, international media and business executives are pulling out of an investment conference next week. 
London Stock Exchange chief executive David Schwimmer joined the list on Tuesday, as did the CEOs of HSBC ,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), and David Bonderman, the billionaire chairman and founding partner of private equity firm TPG.
The City of London Corporation, which governs the capital's financial district, said its Policy and Resources Chairman Catherine McGuinness would no longer attend, and Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said he most likely would not either. 
Saudi Arabia has said it would retaliate against any pressure or economic sanctions.
COLLECTING EVIDENCE
CNN said on Monday that after denying for two weeks any role in his disappearance, Saudi Arabia was preparing to say he died in a botched interrogation.
The New York Times said Prince Mohammed had approved an interrogation or abduction of Khashoggi and the government would shield him by blaming an intelligence official. Saudi authorities could not be reached for comment.
Turkish authorities have an audio recording indicating that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, Turkish sources have told Reuters.
The Turkish team that searched the consulate took away soil samples and a metal door from the garden, a Reuters witness said, but a senior official acknowledged the difficulty of collecting evidence 13 days after the incident.
The Turkish security source confirmed that Saudi Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi left Istanbul on Tuesday, returning to Riyadh, hours before his residence was set to be searched.
He said Turkish authorities had not asked him to go, adding: ""He wanted to leave"".
""WRECKING BALL""
Khashoggi moved to Washington last year fearing retribution for his criticism of Prince Mohammed, who has cracked down on dissent with arrests.
Many members of the U.S. Congress have strong criticized the kingdom. 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, describing himself as a long-time supporter of Riyadh, called Prince Mohammed ""a wrecking ball"" and accused him of Khashoggi's killing.
""This guy’s gotta go,"" he said on Fox News.
Graham told Fox News Radio separately he was worried about one of Khashoggi's children still living in Saudi Arabia and had offered to help his ""three American citizen children"".
Khashoggi moved to Washington last year fearing retribution for his criticism of Prince Mohammed, who has cracked down on dissent with arrests.

The Saudi riyal, rebounded early after falling to its lowest in two years over fears that foreign investment could shrink. Saudi stock index initially dropped 3 percent but ended up after state-linked funds came in to buy toward the close.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Brazil right-winger would follow Trump's lead on foreign policy,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The far-right front-runner in Brazil's presidential race plans to put foreign policy in the hands of a diplomat who has praised the nationalist agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump that has shaken the global order, an adviser to the candidate said.
Policy experts said the pick fits conservative firebrand Jair Bolsonaro's plan to make Brazil's most dramatic foreign policy shift in decades. Bolsonaro has already vowed to rethink membership in developing nation blocs Mercosur and BRICS and move the country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, embracing Trump as few in Latin America have done.
That represents a direct reversal of nearly a decade and a half of diplomacy under leftist Workers Party (PT) governments, which focused on alliances with South American neighbors and other emerging powers.
With a commanding lead just a dozen days before a run-off against Fernando Haddad of the PT, Bolsonaro has already begun naming members of a future cabinet, but has not confirmed his pick for foreign minister.
Ernesto Fraga Araújo, head of the United States and Canada department at the foreign ministry, is Bolsonaro's first choice for the role, according to Paulo Kramer, a politics professor who advises the Bolsonaro campaign.
In unusual behavior for a Brazilian diplomat, Fraga Araújo has used a personal blog dedicated to arguments ""Against Globalism"" to call for Brazilians to back Bolsonaro's campaign. But it was an article called ""Trump and the West"" in a diplomatic journal that showed the Bolsonaro camp how much the 51-year-old diplomat shared their world view, Kramer said.
Fraga Araújo argued in the paper that Trump is saving Western Christian civilization from radical Islam and ""globalist cultural Marxism"" by standing up for national identity, family values and the Christian faith as Europe has not.
Brazil has a chance to recover its ""Western soul,"" embrace Trump's brand of nationalism, and pursue its national interests instead of being tied to blocs of nations, he wrote.
MAKE BRAZIL GREAT
Bolsonaro has not been shy about his affinity for the U.S. president, whose 2016 campaign served as a model for his own anti-establishment movement, pledging an iron fist against corruption and crime.
""Just like he wants to make America great, I want to make Brazil great,"" the former army captain said on the Roda Viva television program in July.
He proudly saluted the U.S. flag at an event in Florida with Brazilian expatriates, according to a video his campaign posted on social media last year.
Brazil, one of the world's most closed major economies, is already skeptical of free trade. But Bolsonaro has pointed to several symbolic moves underscoring an ideological realignment, too.
One of the clearest signals would be moving Brazil's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following Trump's cue, as neighboring Paraguay has done.
Brazil has long supported a two-state solution for the conflict over Palestine and in 2010 recognized the Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with Israel.
However, Bolsonaro has said Palestine is not a country and vowed to move Brazil's embassy to Jerusalem and close the Palestinian embassy in Brasilia. 
""It's a great idea because it would signal change and say to the world that we cherish democracies that have the rule of law and independent powers with checks and balances,"" said Congressman-elect Luiz P. O. Bragança, who has advised Bolsonaro on foreign policy.
""Israel is probably the only country in the Middle East that falls into that category. All the others are oligarchies or dictatorships,"" said Bragança, a member of the family with a claim to the throne lost when Brazil became a republic in 1889.
QUESTIONING ALLIANCES
Bolsonaro's attitude toward South American neighbors has been chillier, especially socialist Venezuela, which he has pledged to confront firmly. Still, his aides said he would not cut off diplomatic ties or close the border because that would shut out refugees flowing into Brazil. 
He has publicly disdained the fractious Mercosur trade bloc, which Brazil founded with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
""Bolsonaro's foreign policy will be pragmatic. It will not discriminate against any nation and will follow the best interests of Brazil,"" said Kramer, his foreign policy adviser.
Even the BRICS alliance, which has gained steam as Brazil set up development banks and encouraged trade with Russia, India, China and South Africa, could get a skeptical second look from Bolsonaro. Many in Brazil's foreign ministry would resist a move to withdraw.
""Bolsonaro could try to get out of BRICS with a Trumpian attitude,"" said Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. ""That would send a signal to China that Brazil is becoming hostile.""
Stuenkel said Bolsonaro would have an easier time getting out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which he blames for tying Brazil's hands on managing land, including the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
On China, Brazil's main trade partner and source of foreign investment in recent years, experts say Bolsonaro may be forced to temper his more antagonistic impulses for the sake of economic interests.
Bolsonaro has warned of Chinese investors taking control of strategic natural resources in the mining and energy sectors.
""China isn't buying in Brazil, China is buying Brazil,"" he said in August. ""Are you willing to leave Brazil in the hands of the Chinese?"" 
However, Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United States, is optimistic that a Bolsonaro administration would shun protectionism, even when it comes to China. 

""Bolsonaro may have reservations about the sale of certain assets, but if Chinese investment goes into infrastructure that Brazil badly needs to export food and minerals, I do not think he will oppose it,"" Barbosa said.

Asked to say how late a deal could be struck before a ""no deal"" scenario would follow, a person familiar with the meeting told Reuters that Barnier calculated backwards from Britain's March 29 exit date and suggested December was the ""ultimate deadline"".

While hopes of a deal at a summit on Wednesday were thwarted when talks deadlocked over the Irish border issue on Sunday, Barnier hoped that progress could be made especially next month so that the British and EU parliaments would have time to ratify any agreement before Brexit actually happened.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar financial network that supports an Iranian paramilitary force that it said recruits and trains child soldiers for the country's elite Revolutionary Guards.
The announcement came two weeks before the Trump administration reimposes some of the United States' harshest sanctions against Iran, including its oil sector. 
The Bonyad Taavon Basij network provides financial infrastructure to the Basij Resistance Force, a paramilitary force that works for Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Treasury said in a statement. 
Both Basij groups were targeted by the new sanctions.
""This vast network provides financial infrastructure to the Basij's efforts to recruit, train, and indoctrinate child soldiers who are coerced into combat under the IRGC's direction,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The Basij is involved in violent crackdowns and serious human rights abuses within Iran, the statement said. It recruits and trains fighters for the IRGC-Quds Force, including Iranian children as young as 12, who then deploy to Syria to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad regime, it said.
The designations highlight that ""this Iranian regime is not a normal government,"" a senior administration official said. ""Normal governments don't have revolutionary arms that support revolution and wreak havoc with their neighbors. They don't recruit indoctrinate and use child soldiers.""
The sanctions were imposed on Bank Mellat, Mehr Eqtesad Bank, Mehr Eqtesad Iranian Investment Co and five other investment firms, the Treasury said. 
The sanctions also target Iran Tractor Manufacturing Co, the Middle East's largest tractor manufacturer, and Esfahan's Mobarakeh Steel Co, the largest steelmaker in the Middle East and North Africa region, Treasury said.

Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri asked Bettel to form the next government on Tuesday, noting in a statement that Bettel's Democratic Party, the Socialist Workers Party (LSAP) and the Greens had expressed a desire to start coalition negotiations.
Opinion polls before Sunday's election had indicated the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) - which was led for 19 years by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker - would end Bettel's five-year term as prime minister.
The CSV was again the largest party, but actually lost seats, as did the LSAP and the Democratic Party. However, because the Greens gained, the three parties in government have 31 seats in the 60-seat chamber.
The CSV was pushed out of government for only the second time since World War Two in a snap election Juncker called in 2013 after a wire-tapping scandal.
Unlike some neighboring countries, where migration has boosted anti-immigrant parties, the far right has not made inroads in Luxembourg.
However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners, mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.

Whatever the future government, the foreign policy of the European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is unlikely to change much.

The agency has been plagued by infighting over the last three years and is subject to ongoing government investigations.
Judge Robert Nugent, who is heading the inquiry into Moyane, says the suspended tax chief should be removed from office for the ""reckless mismanagement of SARS"" under his tenure.
""We consider it imperative that a new commissioner be appointed without delay to remove the uncertainty at SARS and enable it to be set on a firm course of recovery so as to arrest ongoing loss of revenue,"" Nugent said in the report.
In March, Ramaphosa suspended Moyane, saying he had failed as commissioner of the revenue service and had lost the confidence of taxpayers.
Moyane was not available for comment on Tuesday. He has repeatedly defended his record and denied any wrongdoing.
The president's office said Ramaphosa was weighing up the contents of the interim report and its recommendations.
As part of that process, Ramaphosa had given a copy of the interim report to Moyane, and invited him to make any submissions on its recommendations.

Moyane, who was appointed in 2014, had been criticized by SARS employees and members of the ruling African National Congress after the tax agency missed revenue collection targets and faced allegations of corruption and mismanagement.

BRUSSELS/LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union leaders will give British Prime Minister Theresa May a tough reception in Brussels on Wednesday, warning her to rally support at home for the Brexit deal on offer or be cut loose without one in March.
May will address the other 27 EU national leaders at a summit before they sit down to dinner without her. Officials said they expected the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer since talks stalled on Sunday and they will step up preparations for Britain to drop out of the bloc with no deal. 
Summit chair Donald Tusk warned that the risk of a ""no deal"" dumping Britain out of the bloc and into legal limbo and border chaos on March 29 was greater than ever. He put the onus on May to bring a ""creative"" solution to break the impasse over the EU-UK land border on the island of Ireland. 
Tusk called it a ""Gordian Knot"", making clear he did not see May as a contemporary ""Alexander the Great"", capable of slicing through the tangle of opposition she faces in London and Belfast over her Brexit plan in order to clinch a treaty with the EU.
The ""no deal"" message is sincere enough. It is also a tactic to pressure a negotiating partner the EU views as weak. And it might just help May by giving her the kind of political theater useful in persuading Britons she has fought for the best deal.
More subtly, leaders may also sound relaxed on the calendar for talks. On Tuesday, officials echoed the mantra that ""the clock is ticking"" to agree a treaty that parliaments can ratify in time for Brexit. But, sensing more urgency in London, senior EU officials said Brussels would ""keep calm and carry on"", ready to wait till December or even later to clinch a final agreement.
""For now, Britain is negotiating with Britain,"" Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said, referring to May's troubles with her own cabinet and supporters. ""We need more weeks to see if we can get a deal. We'll work calmly.""
Germany's Europe minister called on May to ""take responsibility and be constructive"". But some diplomats believe May could be unable to move again in negotiations until after she has steered her budget through parliament in early November. 
PREPARATIONS FOR NO DEAL
Leaders will decide at dinner after May has left them on whether to firm up a tentative plan to hold a special Brexit summit in mid-November. But Tusk said they would need to believe that a deal was nearly done -- and without some new move from May in Brussels, that belief seems unlikely to come this week.
""There needs to be a much clearer, sharper messaging on the choice the UK faces,"" one senior diplomat told fellow national envoys after talks broke down on Sunday. The EU had gone as far as it could to address May's difficulties with her hardline pro-Brexit and Northern Irish allies, he said -- now the summit must not let May think things were just carrying on as normal.
Quite how tough the EU message is to May after Wednesday's dinner will depend on her approach, diplomats said. If she brings to Brussels the uncompromising tone they heard a month ago in Salzburg, when name-calling on both sides hit a low, then the EU warnings of impending calamity will step up a notch.
EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker will tell leaders after May has spoken on Wednesday evening about his European Commission's plans for a ""no deal"". Officials say that will include how to rush through emergency EU legislation to cope with huge disruption to transport and trade links.
The Commission had planned to release its proposals last week but held off, officials said, because Brexit negotiators did not want to sour what was an increasingly positive mood in talks behind the scenes. The brick wall those talks hit over the Irish border issue has flipped around that logic.

Some EU leaders, notably President Emmanuel Macron of France which faces questions over intensive cross-Channel trade and traffic, want much more public clarity to show that the bloc could cope with cutting Britain out of EU regulations.

Historians have traditionally dated the disaster to Aug. 24 79 AD, but excavations on the vast site in southern Italy have unearthed a charcoal inscription written on a wall that includes a date which corresponds to Oct. 17.
The writing came from an area in a house that was apparently being renovated just before the nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying Pompeii under a thick blanket of ash and rock.
""Being charcoal, fragile and evanescent, which could not last a long time, it is more than likely that it was written in October 79 AD,"" said Massimo Osanna, head of the Pompeii site.
The Aug. 24 date derives from an account of the blast given by Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the eruption and wrote about it almost 30 years after the event in two letters to his friend, the Roman historian Tacitus. 
However, previous excavations have uncovered a calcified branch bearing berries that normally only come out in autumn. The discovery of some braziers over the years also suggested the disaster did not strike at the height of summer.
Osanna suggested the correct date might have been Oct. 24.
Showing off the faint writing on an uncovered white wall, Culture Minister Alberto Bonisoli hailed it as an ""extraordinary discovery"".

""Today, with a lot of humility, maybe we're rewriting the history books because we're dating the eruption to the second half of October,"" Bonisoli said.

President Paul Biya is widely expected to extend his 36-year rule by winning a seventh term, making him one of Africa's longest serving leaders.
But allegations of voter intimidation, violence and ballot-stuffing have cast doubt over the Oct. 7 election and raised political tensions ahead of results expected before Sunday. 
Opposition candidate Maurice Kamto, who declared victory shortly after the vote without providing actual figures, asked the court to cancel results in seven regions of Cameroon. 
""This election was absolutely irregular,"" Emmanuel Simh, the vice president of Kamto's Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon (MRC) party, said in court on Tuesday. 
Cameroon's electoral body Elecam has defended its organization of the poll and said over the weekend that it had not seen any proof of fraud. Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary has dismissed allegations of fraud. 
Candidates Joshua Osih and Cabral Libii have asked for the results to be canceled and the election to be re-run. 
Civil society groups have called for peaceful demonstrations against the election process, but none have taken place so far.
Opposition to another seven years of Biya rule comes amid a separatist insurgency in the English-speaking South West and North West regions where there were isolated incidents of violence on election day and where few went to vote.
Crisis Group analyst Hans De Marie Heungoup estimated an average voter participation of 55 percent in Francophone regions and five percent in Anglophone areas.
The major cocoa and oil producer has experienced economic growth of over 4 percent a year since Biya was last elected in 2011, but many of its 24 million citizens still live in poverty.

An Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the north, which spread from neighboring Nigeria, has killed scores over the past decade. The Anglophone crisis has cost hundreds of lives and forced thousands to flee their homes.

""Little progress has been made in addressing the underlying conditions that lead to violent extremism,"" said Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
U.S.-backed forces and Iraqi militias liberated nearly all of the territory that Islamic State, also known as ISIS, once controlled in Iraq and Syria.
""Challenges remain in our political, our military, our intelligence, and our law enforcement cooperation despite the fact that we've had some positive trends and cooperation, clearly there is much more to be done,"" said Dunford, who was speaking during a conference countering violent extremism.
One of the issues facing U.S.-backed forces in Syria is the large number of foreign fighters being detained.
The U.S. military says the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters led by the Kurdish YPG militia, is holding about 700 foreign fighters and attempting to repatriate them back to their home countries.
In a report earlier this year, the State Department warned that Islamic State, al Qaeda and its affiliates have adapted by dispersing and becoming less vulnerable to military action after the United States and its partners made ""major strides"" against the armed Islamist groups.
Islamic State, al Qaeda and their affiliates, however, ""have proven to be resilient, determined and adaptable, and they have adjusted to heightened counterterrorism pressure in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and elsewhere,"" the report said.

""Perhaps the greatest challenge facing us today is the danger of complacency,"" Dunford said.

He appeared to have been planning to start a fire at a McDonald's restaurant at the western city's main train station with a large container of gasoline and gas cartridges. This could have caused a ""huge"" explosion, Senior Cologne police official Klaus-Stephan Becker told a news conference.
He took the woman hostage minutes later in a nearby pharmacy where she works.
Witness statements suggested the man, who arrived in Germany in March 2015, had links to Islamic State, though no evidence to support that had been found, Becker said.
A search of the man's home uncovered further supplies of gasoline and Arabic writing on the wall ""with Muslim references but not Islamist ones,"" he said.
For reasons that are not yet clear, he went from the McDonald's to the pharmacy, carrying one of the gas cartridges and fire accelerants with him.
An identity document found at the scene of the hostage-taking showed the man had the right of residence in Germany until June 2021, Becker said.
The man lived in refugee accommodation and did not have a job because he could not work, Becker said. Asked if that was due to psychological problems, he said: ""That's what seems to be emerging.""

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>",No date set for UK parliament speaker's exit: spokeswoman,"LONDON (Reuters) - The speaker of Britain's lower house of parliament, John Bercow, will leave his post next summer, the BBC and other local media reported on Tuesday, but his office said he had made no announcement about a leaving date.
An investigation published on Monday said the House of Commons had allowed a culture of bullying and sexual harassment to thrive, and its top officials may need to be replaced to restore confidence.
The BBC and other British media outlets reported that Bercow had told friends of his plan to quit next year. His office downplayed the reports.
""The Speaker has made no announcement about his leaving date. He was elected by the House in 2017 for the course of the parliament. In the event he has anything to say on his future plans, he will make an announcement to the House first,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.
The current parliament is due to run until 2022.
A debate in parliament on the harassment investigation saw some lawmakers call directly on Tuesday for Bercow to quit. He has himself faced allegations of bullying from former members of staff, which he has denied. 
The speaker's job is to chair debates in parliament's directly-elected chamber. Bercow is the highest authority within the House of Commons, which gives him considerable influence over the political agenda in parliament.
For example, he is expected to be faced with a crucial decision in the upcoming vote on any Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May is able to strike with Brussels.

He will likely have to decide whether to permit opponents of May's Brexit plan to try and change the terms of the debate into one on a second referendum - a key decision which could allow lawmakers to put pressure on May to avoid a 'no-deal' exit.

LONDON/LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told her ministers on Tuesday they would secure a Brexit deal if they stood together, calling for a show of unity to silence those pressing her to rethink her strategy for leaving the European Union.
A day before heading to Brussels for a summit, May is keen to show she has her cabinet's support after facing pressure from some members of her Conservative Party and the EU to change tack on Brexit, Britain's biggest policy shift in more than 40 years.
But she will face demands in the Belgian capital to come up with new ideas to break a deadlock in the Brexit talks over the so-called Irish backstop, a fallback plan to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the efforts to find agreement were like ""squaring the circle"".
Less than six months before Britain is due to leave, the impasse has increased the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit that could potentially disrupt trade, delay movement of goods and starve the world's fifth largest economy of investment.
May's spokesman said the cabinet had held ""a very detailed and thorough discussion"" on the border issue, with the team united in rejecting any deal that would split the United Kingdom and might ""trap"" Britain in the backstop indefinitely.
""The PM said there will no doubt be challenging moments ahead, that is in the nature of negotiations. She said she is committed to securing a Brexit that delivers on the referendum result, safeguards jobs and security, and which preserves our union,"" her spokesman told reporters.
Quoting May directly, he said she told her ministers: ""I am convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we can achieve this.""
He said ministers had shared their concerns over the backstop, playing down a ""pizza summit"" attended by eight of them late on Monday to discuss Brexit and whether to back May's strategy. The meeting had prompted some reports of possible resignations.
Asked whether any minister indicated they might be considering resigning, he replied: ""They did not."" 
""NEW FACTS""
Both sides say much of the withdrawal agreement, which sets the divorce terms for Britain's departure, has been agreed, but there are still outstanding issues, mostly on the backstop.
The EU has stuck to its position - a backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland cannot be time-limited and cannot include the whole of the United Kingdom remaining in the customs union.
European Council President Donald Tusk said he would ask May at Wednesday's summit whether she had any new proposals to break the impasse. ""For a breakthrough to take place besides goodwill we need new facts,"" he said.
May's spokesman said she had already set out her position on Brexit, but that she was looking forward to meeting Tusk.
Under pressure from lawmakers in her Conservative Party and from her parliamentary partners, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, to hold firm, May must try to convince her critics that she can deliver on the backstop.
Her spokesman said ministers had discussed one possible way out of the stand-off - ""a mechanism to clearly define how that backstop will end"".
But while many in the EU were nervous about the lack of any deal yet, others said progress could still be made.
The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said both sides would work ""calmly and seriously"" in the coming weeks to try to reach agreement on the backstop.
He said the withdrawal agreement with Britain had to be ""orderly for everyone and all the subjects, including Ireland"". [nB5N1SU00J]

In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday he still believed a positive outcome was possible, but added: ""I am disappointed and concerned... it has not been possible to make the decisive progress we so urgently need. The gaps between the positions are significant and time is running out.""

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","EU grapples with signs of eroding democracy in Poland, Hungary","By Gabriela Baczynska
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union ministers discussed for the sixth time on Tuesday concerns that Poland's ruling nationalists are undercutting democratic institutions in their country, although ultimately there may be little the bloc can do about the problem.
Concerns have grown in the EU since Warsaw accelerated its judicial overhaul despite a related legal case pending in the bloc's top court.
The gathering of 28 EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday aired similar concerns over the rule of law in Hungary, another eastern ex-communist country, where euroskeptic ruler Viktor Orban has tightened controls on the media, courts and NGOs.
""Things have not improved, they have deteriorated,"" the Commission's deputy head, Frans Timmermans, told a news conference after the meeting.
""Especially disappointing I find the fact that, although now there is a procedure before the European Court of Justice, the Polish authorities have not used the fact that there is this procedure to stop the implementation of the reform of the Supreme Court and have actually sped it up by nominating more judges at that court.""
Diplomats said the ministers would return to the matter in November or December.
The EU has opened punitive procedures against both Poland and Hungary under Article 7 of its treaties on how to deal with states that flout the bloc's founding values including democracy and the rule of law.
This could in theory lead to these countries losing their voting rights in the EU, although in practice that is highly unlikely and the procedure is more of a blow to their reputation. Any actual punishment would require all other member states to agree to it in unanimity.
The painstaking process highlights how ill-equipped the EU is to stand up to its own members taking an illiberal course.
Warsaw pressed ahead this month with changes to its Supreme Court despite the country's Administrative Court saying the process of appointing new judges should be halted.
Many Polish judges have been forced into early retirement by new laws pushed through parliament by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.
The EU, international judicial organizations and rights groups have all denounced this as political meddling that undermines the fundamental democratic principle of the independence of courts.
""Poland did not wait for the decision of the ECJ and has taken actions which will be difficult to change afterwards,"" France's EU minister Nathalie Loiseau told the meeting in a joint statement with Germany.
Belgium's Didier Reynders said the problem with EU states flouting the bloc's basic democratic tenets was broader, listing Hungary and Romania as other examples.
Concerns about how healthy some democracies are among the 28 member states have also focused on anti-graft reforms in Romania and the murdering of journalists investigating state corruption in Malta and Slovakia.

Tuesday marks the first anniversary of the killing of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, a case that has yet to be explained in full.

PARIS (Reuters) - Anti-corruption investigators raided the home and party headquarters of French far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon on Tuesday, part of a long-running investigation into the alleged misuse of European Parliament funds to pay party employees.
The raids took place at the offices of La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) in central Paris and Melenchon's private residence, where hundreds of supporters gathered at his urging to protest against the police action. 
""This is a politically-motivated act, it's an act of political aggression,"" Melenchon said in a video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Later, standing outside the party headquarters, he called the raids an ""enormous operation by politicized police"".
A source close to the raids, which targeted 15 locations and included another left-wing party, said they were being carried out by a specialist anti-corruption unit that focuses on financial and tax irregularities. 
Two investigations are underway, one looking into the alleged misuse of European Parliament funds to pay party employees in France, and the other examining funding of Melenchon's French presidential campaign last year. 
Several French parties have been targeted over their use of European Parliament funds, including Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (formerly called the National Front) and the centrist Modem party. 
Lawmakers elected to the European Parliament are allocated funds to cover expenses, including the running of their offices in Brussels and Strasbourg and assistants' salaries, but they cannot use the money to pay for party staff at home.
Last week, a French judge stepped up the inquiry into Le Pen, with a source inside her party saying she was now being investigated for possible embezzlement of public funds, having previously been questioned over breach of trust. [nL8N1WS2Z4]
Melenchon, 67, frequently denounces President Emmanuel Macron for backing laws favoring the wealthy and right-wing voters. 
A member of the European Parliament from 2009-17, he was eliminated in the first round of the presidential election last year, coming fourth. He said he had nothing to fear from the investigations.
""I've asked for all my campaign accounts to be re-examined,"" he said, draped in the red-white-and-blue sash of a member of the French lower house, the National Assembly. 

""I'm not afraid of anyone. These people can invade my house, my party headquarters and my movement, but they will not scare me. We haven't stolen anything. We are honest.""

Casting gloom on the state of play ahead of a summit of EU leaders this week, Tusk said he wished for a leader of the likes of the Macedonian king, fabled to have solved the riddle of the Gordian Knot by slicing through it with one stroke of his sword.
""It looks like a new version of the Gordian Knot,"" Tusk said of an impasse over how to ensure there is no return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
""Unfortunately, I can't see a new version of Alexander the Great,"" he quipped. ""It's not so easy to find this kind of creative leader.""
With less than six months to go before Britain's departure, he said he hoped Prime Minister Theresa May would present something creative enough to solve the impasse at the leaders' summit but added there was not much grounds for optimism.

Asked whether May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson might have the mettle to find a solution, Tusk said such claims may be exaggerated.

Facing scandals in the United States, Chile, Australia and Germany, among others, Francis has summoned the heads of the national Catholic bishops' conference to a meeting in the Vatican in February.
The Spanish group, made up of church lawyers, will start work this week to prepare material for the meeting, the national bishops' conference said in a statement on Tuesday.
Next on the group's agenda will be updating the protocol on how cases of child sexual abuse are treated and writing new rules to replace the current code, which was established in 2010. 
The current rules help bishops, priests, and other religious officials and institutions to handle cases of sexual abuse or aggression toward minors, or possession of child pornography, the statement said. 
A judicial vicar from the southern Spanish diocese of Cartagena said in an interview with the newspaper El Pais on Monday that the church had hushed up abuse cases around the world in the twentieth century, including in Spain. 
Gil Jose Saez Martinez said Spanish dioceses do not keep documents showing that priests were moved between parishes because of reports or evidence of sexual abuse. 
Ten Spanish priests were charged with child sexual abuse in 2015, in a case brought after Pope Francis telephoned the victim to offer the Church's apology.

NILAKKAL, India (Reuters) - Tensions rose at an Indian hill temple on Tuesday before an expected face-off between women of menstrual age who can enter for the first time in centuries and conservative Hindu groups who want to stop them. 
The Sabarimala hill temple in the southern state of Kerala has been the site of widespread protests since late September, when the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on women between the ages of 10 to 50 entering the temple infringed on rights to equality of worship.
Final talks between the state and temple priests broke down after the secular government said it would defend the rights of women to enter the site. Their first chance since the ban was lifted will come at 5 p.m. local time (1130 GMT) on Wednesday.
Hindu groups say the prohibition is required to appease the temple's chief deity Ayyappan, depicted as a yoga-practicing god considered eternally celibate by followers. 
In some Hindu communities, menstruating women are regarded as unclean, leading to restrictions and in a few cases outright bans on women of child-bearing age from entering certain places.
One of the groups, Shiv Sena, a former ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said its members will commit suicide if women in the age group enter the temple.
""Seven members of our organization are ready to sacrifice their lives if the women come forward to defy the customs and traditions of the temple,"" said Peringamala Aji, a Shiv Sena leader.
On Tuesday in Nilakkal, the main access point, 18 kilometers from the temple, female devotees belonging to a tribal community called Malayarayan were pulling over traffic to check for women of menstrual age, forcing a group of female journalism students off a government-run bus. 
""We stop those defying our request and are detaining them at Nilakkal,"" the group's leader, Sujatha, who goes by only one name, told Reuters. 
A 51-year-old woman from the tribe tried to commit suicide at the site, before being saved by other female protesters. The woman, known as Ratnamma, later told Reuters that she was protesting against attempts by some women to enter the temple. 
CULTURAL BATTLE 
The Kerala state government, led by the Communist Party of India, has said it will not give in to attempts by Hindu groups to prevent women from entering that temple. 
""We will not allow anyone to take law and order into their hands,"" Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters.
A release by Vijayan's office said the government would deploy sufficient police, including female officers, to uphold the Supreme Court's decision. 
Pilgrims have for centuries visited the Subarimala temple, in a remote tiger reserve in the Western Ghats mountain range.

Many of those visiting the site take a vow of celibacy for 41 days before beginning a trek through the mountains to the temple, located around 3,000 feet above sea level, according to the temple's website.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday he will ask British Prime Minister Theresa May this week if she has new ideas on how to break the impasse in Brexit talks, adding that he has become less optimistic about an immediate breakthrough.
Tusk told reporters his hopes for their meeting on Wednesday had been dampened by European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, as well as events in the British parliament.
""Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiations that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterday's debate in the House of Commons, give me no grounds for optimism before tomorrow's European Council on Brexit,"" said Tusk, who will chair the EU summit in Brussels.
A breakthrough required more than just goodwill. ""Tomorrow, I'm going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible,"" he said.
EU leaders, meeting from Wednesday evening, had hoped to reach a provisional deal over Britain's exit from the EU in March before signing off on a withdrawal agreement at a special Brexit summit in November. 
Tusk said the November meeting would make sense only if there were a feeling of being really close to a breakthrough.
The talks are stuck over the issue of the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and have not resumed since Sunday.
Tusk likened the issue to the Gordian Knot, cut in legend by Alexander the Great, saying ""It is not so easy to find this kind of creative leader.""

Leaders, he said, would step up their preparations for a no-deal Brexit. ""A no-deal scenario becomes more likely than ever before, but it doesn't mean it is our political priority.""

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan authorities have resumed an investigation into the unexplained killing of a top rebel commander in the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, a case that could reopen old wounds.
The unsolved killing of Abdel Fattah Younes by suspected fellow fighters in 2011 caused deep rifts inside the rebel camp of the kind that have marked the turmoil and violence gripping Libya ever since.
The investigation risks stirring new tensions between eastern Libya, controlled by the forces of General Khalifa Haftar, and a U.N.-backed administration in the capital Tripoli.
Haftar ordered the eastern military prosecutor to ""immediately and urgently reopen the investigation"" of the killing of Younes and two others slain in 2011, according to a decree posted late on Monday.
A previous investigation launched in 2011 had named as prime suspect Ali Essawi, who was deputy prime minister during the uprising at a rebel transitional authority which took over power from Gaddafi.
A court later dropped the case against Essawi and other suspects. But Essawi resurfaced into the spotlight when Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez appointed him as economy minister this month.
His appointment had sparked angry reactions from Younes's Obeidat tribe and a second eastern-based tribe, who warned in comments published on local media that the move was a provocation.
Both tribes are among the most powerful in the east and allied to Haftar, who has conquered most of eastern Libya.
The United Nations has been trying to mediate between east and west in a bid to overcome divisions and prepare the North African country for elections.
France had been pushing for the vote in December but recent fighting between rival groups in Tripoli and a lack of a constitutional basis has dimmed the prospect.
Younes was for years part of Gaddafi's inner circle.
He defected at the start of the uprising in February 2011 and became the military chief of the rebellion, a move opposed by other rebels who had suffered under the old regime.
His death caused deep rifts within the rebellion, exposing tensions between Islamists - whom Gaddafi fiercely suppressed during his 42-year dictatorship - and secularists and former army figures, with various factions accusing each other of responsibility. 
The circumstances of his killing remain murky, but it is known that he was slain in July 2011 after rebel leaders summoned him back from the front line to Benghazi, the eastern city and cradle of the uprising.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - A million-euro ($1.2 million) reward for information on who ordered the murder of Malta's most prominent journalist is still available, a year after her death.
Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, who wrote an anti-corruption blog, was killed on Oct. 16, 2017 by a car bomb. Three people arrested in December were charged with the killing, which they have denied.
Police believe an as-yet-unidentified person ordered the attack that Justice Minister Owen Bonnici called ""the biggest crime that has ever happened in Malta"".
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia's writings, offered the reward last year.
The money would be paid for anything ""which can unlock the facts behind the murder. So I reiterate the offer, it is still there,” Bonnici told Reuters in an interview. 
The minister defended the daily cleanup of a national memorial opposite Valletta's law courts that has become a shrine to the journalist's memory and a center of protest against alleged corruption.
""We have the rule of law in Malta. We have procedures. You cannot simply wake up in the morning and appropriate yourself of a national monument,"" he said, adding that he had asked the activists to apply for a permanent memorial to be set up. 
Bonnici said the government had made strides to improve the freedom of journalists since the murder, including abolishing criminal libel.
But he declined to criticize the fact that Caruana Galizia's family continued to face civil defamation lawsuits for what the journalist wrote, saying those who had been defamed felt they had the right to seek redress.

Local and international media groups, including Reuters, began following up stories covered by Caruana Galizia in the wake of her death, in an initiative called the Daphne Project.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea held their first three-way talks with the United Nations Command (UNC) on Tuesday to discuss ways to demilitarize the border as the neighbors push for peace, South Korea's defense ministry said. 
The two Koreas agreed this week to begin reconnecting rail and road links, in spite of U.S. concerns that a rapid thaw in relations could undermine efforts to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Tuesday's meeting followed a summit between leaders of the two countries in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, last month.
The two leaders agreed to hold talks with the UNC, which overlaps with U.S. forces in the South and oversees affairs in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, to smooth the way to disarming one of the world's most heavily fortified frontiers. 
The meeting on Tuesday lasted for about two hours at the border village of Panmunjom, and was led by military officials of the rank of colonel from the two sides and Burke Hamilton, secretary of the UNC Military Armistice Commission, the ministry said.
""They discussed practical issues regarding demilitarisation steps to be conducted in the future,"" the South Korean ministry said in a statement.
The steps they are aiming for range from withdrawing firearms and guard posts to reducing personnel and adjusting surveillance equipment, the ministry said, adding that the three-way channel would be used for more discussions.
General Vincent Brooks, who leads the United Nations Command, said the talks were designed to use existing means of managing issues along the DMZ to try to achieve the goals set out by the two Koreas.
""I am encouraged by this productive, trilateral dialogue,"" Brooks said in a statement. Future meetings would move on to tackle the steps the two sides had set out, he said.
North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.
As an initial step, the neighbors are looking to pull out 11 guard posts within 1 km (0.6-mile) of a Military Demarcation Line on their border by the end of the year.
They began removing land mines in several small areas this month and will build roads for a pilot project set for April to excavate the remains of soldiers missing from the Korean War.
Both sides will also withdraw all firearms from a Joint Security Area (JSA) at Panmunjom, cut to 35 each the numbers of personnel stationed there and share information on surveillance equipment.
Tourists will be allowed to go into the JSA. 

The measures would transform the border into a ""place of peace and reconciliation,"" the ministry has said.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","UK Conservative lawmaker deliberately broke campaign spending rules, court hears","By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - A lawmaker from British Prime Minister Theresa May's minority ruling Conservative Party deliberately made false declarations over his spending in a 2015 election, a prosecutor told a London court on Tuesday.
Craig Mackinlay, 52, who beat leading Brexit figure Nigel Farage in the parliamentary election for South Thanet in southeastern England in 2015, earlier this year pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
""Far from being complete and inaccurate, the (expenses) returns were woefully incomplete and woefully inaccurate, and deliberately so,"" Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee said in his opening of the case.
Mackinlay appeared at Southwark Crown Court alongside his election agent Nathan Gray and Marion Little, a campaign director from Conservative head office, who both also deny charges over the expense returns.
Jafferjee said the three shared responsibility for the submission of inaccurate election expenses returns, and that Mackinlay was not an innocent bystander in what unfolded.
Certain ""notional"" spending was omitted from expense returns when it should have been included, he said, such as the salaries of Gray and Little, which were paid for by Conservative headquarters in London.
Little's defence, that she was working on the national campaign to defeat Farage's UK Independence Party (UKIP), didn't fit with the central role she played in Mackinlay's operation, Jafferjee said, adding that the importance of beating Farage meant it ""was clear that this was not going to be any ordinary election campaign.""
""The primary objective was clearly to get Craig Mackinlay elected and defeat Nigel Farage,"" Jafferjee said.
""She was there for one purpose: vote Craig Mackinlay, not vote Conservative generally. Craig Mackinlay knew that.""
The 2015 general election saw Mackinlay beat Farage, the former head of UKIP, into second place by 2,812 votes.
He then retained the seat in June 2017 with an increased majority of more than 6,000 votes as support for UKIP collapsed with Farage - who played a key role in securing Britain's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 - no longer the party's candidate.
In May 2017, prosecutors ruled out bringing more widespread criminal charges over allegations of expenses fraud by the Conservatives during the 2015 campaign.
However the Electoral Commission, the independent election watchdog, last year fined the Conservatives a record 70,000 pounds ($92,500) for breaking rules by incorrectly reporting its spending. 
May's Conservatives remain in power only through an agreement with 10 Northern Ireland MPs after losing their majority in the 2017 general election. If Mackinlay were to be found guilty, he could be jailed for up to a year and there would likely be pressure for a by-election to replace him.

The case is expected to last several weeks.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's anti-corruption agency has arrested nine people, including a top district government official and a company director, in a bribery investigation linked to the Lippo Group's $21 billion Meikarta real estate project near Jakarta.
In a sting operation on Sunday, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) arrested two Lippo Group consultants and an employee accused of trying to pay off city officials to obtain property permits for Meikarta, KPK chairman Laode Muhammad Syarif told a news conference late on Monday.
Costing $21 billion and billed as the ""Shenzhen of Indonesia"", after the booming Chinese city, Meikarta is Lippo's largest project to date and is meant to be a center for the automotive and electronic industries, while including five-star hotels, shopping malls and universities.
Shares in Lippo Group's Lippo Cikarang, a parent company for Meikarta, dropped almost 15 percent after the news and ended down 13.36 percent on Tuesday. 
Syarif told reporters that Lippo director Billy Sindoro was arrested and named as the prime suspect in the case after detained Lippo employees said they had been acting on his instructions to bribe a top district government official.
Syarif identified that official as Neneng Hasanah Yasin, who is the regent for West Java's Bekasi area where the Meikarta project is located, saying he was also arrested.
Through the sting operation, investigators had confiscated 513 million rupiah ($33,772) and S$90,000 ($65,378) that had been intended as bribe money, Syarif said.
Neither Sindoro nor Yasin could immediately be reached for comment through their lawyers.
A lawyer for Meikarta said there was no tolerance for corruption and pledged to collaborate with KPK investigators. Meikarta would also conduct its own internal investigation.
""In the event we find that there was deviation from our anti-corruption principles, we will not hesitate to strictly sanction anyone found guilty according to employment law,"" counsel Denny Indrayana said in Tuesday's statement.
The anti-graft agency has given limited details of the others arrested in connection with the investigation but four of them are civil servants, the agency said.
The complexity of the Meikarta project, involving numerous government agencies in the issuance of its permits, made it more vulnerable to corruption and the KPK suspected there have been other instances of bribery, Syarif said.
Sindoro was convicted in 2009 for bribing an official at the anti-monopoly agency to obtain broadcasting rights for the English Premier League.

He was then president of First Media, another unit of the Lippo Group.

Though the former Dutch finance minister who was president of the euro zone's governing body until January has no role in the Brexit negotiations, he is a veteran of EU crisis management.
A blog post on his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page offered a rare public airing from a senior figure for the idea that the negotiation deadlock may go on.
""There won’t be a Brexit-deal this week, or even next month,"" wrote the 52-year-old Dijsselbloem, who holds no public position at present. He went on to enumerate the difficulties that British Prime Minister Theresa May faces among her own allies in agreeing a deal to keep close EU-UK trade relations.
Hopes of a deal at a summit this week were dashed on Sunday by continued deadlock over how to avoid a disruptive hard land border for Northern Ireland and EU officials have been playing down the urgency of cracking the problem in the coming weeks.
""Extra time is inevitable,"" Dijsselbloem said. 
""It is needed to work out any serious deal, it’s necessary to avoid a vote in the British parliament in the short run. 
""It also may be necessary to allow for new elections or a second referendum if the deal gets rejected in the medium term, which still seems pretty likely.""
Senior EU officials have acknowledged the possibility that a two-year countdown to Brexit, begun when May formally notified the EU of Britain's departure under Article 50 of the EU treaty, could be extended beyond March 29 if all sides agree -- though few governments want that extension to be more than a few weeks.
Dijsselbloem, who steered his fellow Eurogroup finance ministers through five years of euro zone crisis and brinkmanship with Greece, said, however, that any delay could only be agreed with London at the last minute to crack a deal.

""The decision to stop the clock won't come until the very last minute,"" he wrote. ""It won’t be the first time that time has provided us with solutions in times of European crises.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's prime minister created a new ""Ministry of Peace"" in sweeping cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday as he sought to tackle a wave of ethnic violence.
Abiy Ahmed - who has turned the region's politics on its head with a string of reforms since being appointed in April - named new finance and defense ministers in an overhaul that kept only four of the former post holders in their jobs.
The 42-year-old merged ministries to cut the cabinet to 20 from 28 and for the first time handed half of the top jobs to women.
""The main problem in this country is the lack of peace. This (peace) ministry will be working hard to ensure it prevails,"" Abiy told lawmakers. 
About 2.2 million people out of a population of 100 million have been displaced since clashes broke out last year, many of them between rival ethnic groups. 
The new peace ministry will be led by former parliament speaker Muferiat Kamil, and will oversee the intelligence and security agencies, the government said.
Since his appointment, Abiy has made peace with neighbor Eritrea and presided over the partial privatization of key economic sectors such as telecommunications.
He has also extended an olive branch to several rebel groups and promised to rein in the powerful security agencies. Yet the changes have not stopped ethnically-charged violence, some of which escalated since he was named premier.
Former construction minister Aisha Mohammed was named defense minister - the first woman to hold that position in the country.
Ahmed Shide, who has previously served as a deputy minister of finance and a government spokesman, replaced Abraham Tekeste as finance minister.
The economy has grown by nearly 10 percent on average for the past decade, official data shows, but the recent unrest has led to concerns over its long-term stability.
The prime minister also named new ministers of agriculture, culture and tourism, education, labor, mines, planning and development, revenue, science, trade, transport, urban development, and women's affairs - a mixture of new names and reshuffled ministers.

He kept Workneh Gebeyehu as foreign minister, Amir Aman as health minister and Seleshi Bekele as water and electricity minister, as well as Berhanu Tsegaye as attorney general.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis's minority government, led by his ANO party, took power in June, but it has been without a full-time foreign minister since Czech President Milos Zeman Zeman rejected the choice of the junior coalition member, the Social Democrats, for the position.
Social Democrat leader Jan Hamacek had served as both foreign and interior ministers.
Zeman objected to the Social Democrats' first choice, party member and European parliamentarian Miroslav Poche, after he said during the European Union's migration crisis that his country should take in asylum seekers.
That went counter to government policy. The Czech Republic has stood alongside other central European countries in rejecting taking in migrants and opposing Brussels' past efforts to impose mandatory quotas for refugees among member states. 
Petricek, 37 and a relative newcomer to foreign policy, has spoken in favour of helping refugees in camps outside the EU, more in line with Babis's foreign policy. 
He has also said EU sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict should stay in place, backing the government's stance, although Zeman has spoken against the measures.
Petricek was named a deputy foreign minister in August 2018 and had previously worked as a deputy labour minister. He also served as an assistant and advisor to Poche.
On Tuesday, Zeman expressed hope that Petricek could contribute to foreign policy unity.
""The Czech foreign policy has to be united in order to have any meaning,"" Zeman said at the naming ceremony.

Torrential rains unleashed a deluge of boulders, mud and water down Mount Elgon near the border with Kenya, uprooting trees, pulverizing homes and burying residents in the town of Bukalasi and some nearby villages. 
Landslides have become more common in mountainous parts of the East African country in recent years because of expanding settlement and cultivation that have denuded mountainsides of forest cover and other vegetation. 
A government statement put the final death toll at 43, up from an initial figure of 31, and said a further 21 people were injured with around 800 left homeless.
It said the cabinet had ""directed resettlement of persons at risk of (further) landslides to begin immediately"". Around 32.7 billion shillings ($8.66 million) had been allocated to finance emergency relocations of the most vulnerable people. 
A 2,800-acre plot had been procured for relocations, with a further 5,500 people also vulnerable to landslides to follow the initial 800. In all, some 100,000 people deemed to be living in the likely path of landslides will be resettled in coming years.

A 60-year-old man who entered North Korea last month was repatriated through the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone, the ministry said.
All South Korean nationals are required to seek approval from the ministry before contacting North Koreans or traveling to the North. 
The ministry said it was investigating how and why the man reached the North, thanking Pyongyang for returning him “from a humanitarian standpoint”.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, but relations have warmed with a third summit last month and North Korea's pledge to denuclearize.
The two sides held their first three-way talks with the United Nations Command on Tuesday to discuss ways to demilitarize the border as they push for peace.

In two brief and near-identical dispatches, the official Xinhua news agency said the investigation into Fang Fenghui, a senior general who sat on China's top military body, had concluded and his case passed on to prosecutors. 
The other general, Zhang Yang, who sat alongside Fang on the Central Military Commission until both stood down last year, committed suicide in November while being investigated for corruption.
Xinhua said central party and military authorities had sanctioned the recovery of Zhang's proceeds of corruption. 
It said the two men were suspected of giving and receiving bribes and held huge amounts of unexplained financial assets. 
China's military, which is the world's largest and is in the midst of an ambitious modernization campaign, has been a central focus of President Xi Jinping's long-running anti-corruption efforts.
Both men were influential military figures and their downfall was seen as part of a military leadership reshuffle that enabled Xi to install trusted allies and consolidate control over the armed forces.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Two Catholic bishops from China who for the first time were allowed by the Beijing government to attend a Vatican meeting have invited Pope Francis to visit their country, a Catholic newspaper said on Tuesday.
Joseph Guo Jincai and John Baptist Yang Xiaoting attended the first two weeks of a meeting of bishops from around the world, known as a synod, and saw the pope daily.
Their presence was the first concrete sign of a thaw between the Holy See and Beijing following a landmark agreement last month on the naming of bishops in the communist country. 
""While we were here, we invited Pope Francis to come to China,"" Guo said in an interview with Avvenire, the daily newspaper of the Italian bishops conference.
""We are waiting for him,"" Guo said.
The deal, which was in the making for more than 10 years and signed on Sept. 22, gives the Vatican a long-sought say in the choice of bishops in China, though critics have labeled it a sellout to the Communist government.
China's approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
Guo has close ties to the government because he was ordained into the Catholic Patriotic Association without papal permission and had been excommunicated by the Vatican.
As part of the Sept. 22 agreement, the pope lifted his excommunication and recognized his legitimacy, making Guo an important interlocutor between both sides.
Guo said he did not know when a trip could take place but said he and his brother bishop Yang believe it was possible and were praying for it.
""Our presence here was considered impossible but it became possible,"" he said.
The pope is expected to visit Japan next year and on Thursday he will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who will be carrying an invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the pope to visit Pyongyang. 
Vatican officials have stressed that last month's deal between the Holy See and China was pastoral and not political. But many believe it is a precursor to the restoration of diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Beijing after more than 70 years.
That would mean breaking relations with Taiwan. The Vatican is the self-ruled island's last remaining diplomatic ally in Europe. 

Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, has formal relations with 16 other countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia expects to meet the technical criteria for the border-free European Union's Schengen zone by year-end and hopes to join it by 2020, a senior Interior Ministry official said on Tuesday.
Croatia is one of six European Union members not to be part of the passport-free Schengen zone, which area comprises 22 EU member states as well as four non-members -- Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
""Our goal is to meet all the technical criteria by the end of this year. The European Commission must then assess if we're ready to join which we hope it will do before the next elections for the European Parliament next May,"" Terezija Gras, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, told Reuters in an interview.
Gras said Schengen zone membership would help to improve security in Croatia and the wider EU. The free movement of people would also benefit the economy, especially tourism which accounts for almost 20 percent of Croatia's gross domestic product, she said.
""Control over the EU's external borders is the most demanding aspect of our preparations. We have already fully equipped our border with Serbia and now we're doing it on the border with Bosnia,"" Gras said.
Croatia is on the route taken by many migrants from the Middle East and central Asia who are trying to reach wealthier EU states. Some cross into Croatia from Bosnia undeclared.
By the end of September, the number of unauthorized migrants in Croatia had risen by more than 30 percent from an estimated 4,800 people last year, police said this month. Most of them were from Afghanistan.
Once the European Commission gives its approval, member states must approve it politically. One potential stumbling block is Croatia's border dispute with neighboring Slovenia, which blocked Croatia's EU bid in 2009 for the same reason.
""I believe a win-win solution is possible and we're keen to work on that. We think as well that, for security reasons, it is also in Slovenia's interest to have Croatia within the Schengen area,"" Gras said.

Croatia's conservative-led government also hopes that in 2020 it will also achieve entry to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-2), a waiting room for adopting the euro.

The government said it was spending millions of euros to revamp technology at the state weather forecasting agency, after some residents were quoted in the media raising questions about the speed of its alerts.
Officials originally said 13 people died in the floods that raged from Sunday night to Monday morning. On Tuesday they revised the figures to 11 dead and three people missing.
The downpours and floods hit a region near the medieval hilltop city of Carcassonne and dotted with stone villages on a sweep of land wedged between two mountain ranges and the Mediterranean.
Mud-swamped village streets were strewn with upended cars and debris after raging rivers broke their banks. Water rose to the first floor of some dwellings.
One of the worst-hit spots was the remote village of Trebes, where an Islamist attacker killed a gendarme and three people from the area at a supermarket in March. 
The equivalent of seven months of rain fell in a matter of hours while most people were asleep. 
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said the state would fund a new supercalculator that would help to ""fine-tune"" weather predictions and would be on line in a year and a half.
She did not respond directly to residents' questions in the media about whether the Meteo France forecasting agency could have issued its red-alert warning earlier on Monday, and whether that would have made any difference. There was no immediate statement from the agency.

German citizen Mesale Tolu was one of tens of thousands of civil servants and journalists detained in Turkey after a failed coup attempt in 2016 against President Tayyip Erdogan.
In a radio interview, Tolu, 34, suggested her decision to return from Germany and appear in court would signal respect for Turkey's judicial system which in turn might facilitate the lifting of a travel ban imposed on her husband, Suat Corlu, a defendant in the same trial.
Relations between the NATO partners soured after Germany condemned Turkey's arrests following the failed coup of some 50,000 people, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.
Ties have improved in recent months, especially after Turkey released German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel in February and lifted a travel ban imposed against Tolu after she was released from prison in December following eight months in detention.
Barely two months after Turkey allowed Tolu to leave the country, she said she had decided to return and appear in court because she hoped that, while it may end in her serving prison time, it would help get her husband out of Turkey where he faces terrorism charges. 
If convicted she faces up to 20 years in prison.
""We will be sentenced together, from the same judge in the same trial,"" Tolu told ARD broadcaster. ""The judge let me go and not my husband, and if I do not show up, he'll say, 'We let Ms. Tolu go, she's not coming anymore, why should we let Mr. Corlu go?' That is an important reason, also for my son, to go back and participate in the process.""
Tolu said it was not an easy decision for her to return to Turkey. ""But of course it's very important for my son that he can also be with his father. So I have to go back,"" she said.
""I think it will increase the chances that the travel ban for my husband is lifted as well,"" she said.

Tolu said she could not rule out being re-arrested or sentenced. These were risks she had to take, she added.

Polling firm Ibope released a survey late on Monday showing Bolsonaro with a commanding lead, taking 59 percent of the vote against Haddad's 41 percent, although the right-winger is still unable to lead street rallies as he recovers from a near-fatal stabbing in an assassination attempt last month.
The Ibope poll, published by the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper, showed that Haddad now has a higher rejection rate, with 47 percent of those asked saying they would never vote for him, compared with 35 percent rejecting Bolsonaro. 
The survey interviewed 2,506 people on Saturday and Sunday across Brazil and had a 2 percentage point margin of error. 
A 63-year-old, seven-term congressman who openly defends Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, Bolsonaro is pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate, appealing to voters fed up with political corruption and violent crime.
Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor with the Workers Party (PT), has so far been unable to distance himself from the disdain many Brazilians harbor for his party and its imprisoned founder, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was convicted on corruption charges last year.
The PT held the presidency for 13 of the last 15 years and Lula remains beloved by many for his social policies, credited with easing the lives of the poor in one of the world's most unequal countries. 
But the stunning levels of political graft that flourished under the PT governments, revealed by federal investigators in the last four years, have kneecapped Haddad's run. 

He has struggled to both stick by Lula, whom the PT considers an unjustly convicted political prisoner, and also acknowledge the party's errors, promising to clean up the loathed political system.

AGUA CALIENTE, Guatemala (Reuters) - Up to 3,000 migrants crossed from Honduras into Guatemala on Monday on a trek northward, after a standoff with police in riot gear and warnings from Washington that migrants should not try to enter the United States illegally.
The crowd more than doubled in size from Saturday, when some 1,300 people set off from northern Honduras in what has been dubbed ""March of the Migrant,"" an organizer said. The migrants plan to seek refugee status in Mexico or pass through to the United States. 
Reuters could not independently verify the number of participants, but images showed a group carrying backpacks and clogging roads near the border, some waving the Honduran flag. 
The impoverished nations of Central America, from which thousands of migrants have fled in recent years, are under mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to do more to curb mass migration. 
""We are seriously concerned about the caravan of migrants traveling north from Honduras, with false promises of entering the United States by those who seek to exploit their compatriots,"" the U.S. Embassy in Honduras said in a statement on Sunday evening. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence last week called on presidents in the region to tackle the issue, saying Washington would be willing to help with economic development and investment in return. 
Guatemala said in a statement on Sunday that it did not promote or endorse ""irregular migration."" 
Rows of Guatemalan police in black uniforms, some wearing helmets and shields, initially blocked migrants from reaching a customs booth, Reuters images showed. It was not clear how long the standoff lasted, but the group was ultimately able to cross, said march organizer Bartolo Fuentes, a former Honduran lawmaker. 
A police official on site said all Central Americans could pass freely through the region as long as they complied with migration control. 
""We're going to drop in on Donald Trump. He has to take us in,"" said Andrea Fernandez, 24, who left Honduras with a newborn baby, a 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son because she said she could not find work and feared for their safety. 
Mexico's migration institute said in a statement on Monday that march participants would need to follow immigration rules to enter the country, without specifying the criteria.

""The law does not provide for any permission to enter the country without meeting the requirements, and then go on to a third country,"" the government agency said.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Dozens of Afghan police killed or wounded as election nears,"MAZAR-I SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Dozens of Afghan police were killed or wounded in heavy fighting in northern and central provinces overnight, officials said on Tuesday, just days before parliamentary elections which the insurgents have promised to disrupt.
The latest fighting came despite increasing signs of moves toward possible peace talks and followed a meeting in Qatar last week between Taliban officials and Zalmay Khalilzad, the new U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan.
In the northern province of Samangan, 11 police, including the province's deputy police chief, were killed and 30 wounded when Taliban fighters attacked security checkpoints in Dara-e Sof Payeen district, said Naqibullah Tataar, a member of the provincial council.
Another 15 police were captured along with a large quantity of weapons, vehicles and equipment. The Taliban also suffered heavy casualties, he said but had no exact details.
Munir Ahmad Rahimi, spokesman for Samangan police, confirmed the attack and the death of deputy provincial police chief Khawani Taheri but said seven members of the security forces had been killed.
In the central province of Daikundi, hundreds of Taliban fighters equipped with heavy weapons attacked checkpoints in Kajran district and fought an hours-long battle in which eight Afghan soldiers and five police were killed, Ali Akbar Nateqi, the provincial governor's spokesman said.
The Taliban's main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for both attacks, saying 30 police were killed in Samangan province and 19 killed in Daikundi, with large quantities of weapons and equipment and captured.
Although the latest attacks had no apparent direct link with Saturday's elections, they underlined the strength of the Taliban who control large areas of the countryside and earlier this year overran the major city of Ghazni.
Security officials see the increased attacks as part of a broad strategy by the insurgents to establish a strong position to impose their demands if formal peace talks begin. The Taliban have also suffered heavy casualties and say they are willing to keep talking about finding a solution to the conflict.
The United States has said it is willing to take part in talks but insists that the process must be led by the internationally recognized Afghan government, which the Taliban regard as an illegitimate regime imposed by foreign powers. 
In the meanwhile, thousands of civilians have continued to be killed and wounded in the fighting, with more than 8,000 casualties in the first nine months of the year, according to United Nations figures.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Vocational training is being used ""to the greatest extent"" in China's far-western Xinjiang region to ensure militant activities are ""eliminated before they occur,"" a senior Communist Party official said.
The state media interview with Shohrat Zakir, the number two party official and most senior ethnic Uighur in Xinjiang, is China's most detailed defense yet of its policies in the region, which is home to a large Muslim population. 
Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have prompted the United States to consider sanctions against officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses.
After initially issuing blanket denials, Chinese officials have in recent weeks said they were not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education across a network of secret camps, but rather some citizens guilty of minor offences were sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities.
The measures had helped to prevent violent militant attacks in Xinjiang for the past 21 months, Zakir said in an interview published by the Xinhua news agency.
Trainees signed ""education agreements"" to receive ""concentrated training"" and undergo ""live-in study,"" Zakir said.
They received Chinese language lessons and lectures on the country's constitution and laws, he said, without specifying how many people were receiving such training. Skills training included food processing, assembling electronic products, hairdressing, clothes making and e-commerce. 
""Through vocational training, most trainees have been able to reflect on their mistakes and see clearly the essence and harm of terrorism and religious extremism,"" Zakir was quoted as saying. 
""They have also been able to better tell right from wrong and resist the infiltration of extremist thought,"" he said. 
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over what they say are mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home.
Human rights groups and former detainees have said that conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse. They said detainees did not receive any vocational training. 
In response, Beijing has mounted a sophisticated counterattack to criticism of its policies in Xinjiang, courting foreign media and running opinion pieces abroad as its seeks to spin a more positive message.
China says Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists. It rejects all accusations of mistreatment in an area where hundreds have been killed in unrest between Uighurs and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
The interview with Zakir comes a week after Xinjiang inserted into its anti-extremism regulations new clauses that prescribe the use of ""vocational training centers"" to ""educate and transform"" people influenced by extremism.
James Leibold, a Xinjiang expert at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said China was increasingly seeking to deflect international criticism by attempting to retrospectively justify the mass detention camps. 

""International criticism is clearly biting and China's decided to get out in front of the story,"" he said.

On Monday, May urged the European Union not to allow a disagreement over how to ensure there was no return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland derail talks which stalled at the weekend.
""The message is we need to support the prime minister in making further progress this week ... and therefore move to that position of getting that positive outcome for our country,"" Brokenshire told BBC radio. 
""Whilst making sure that it is our entire United Kingdom that leaves the European Union, the single market and the customs union because it is our UK that is just so important.""
May said on Monday she believed a Brexit agreement was still achievable although European Council President Donald Tusk warned that the chances of a no-deal divorce had increased. May is to address her 27 EU peers on Brexit at a summit in Brussels on Wednesday.
The British prime minister is battling to not only satisfy EU demands, but also keep on board eurosceptics in her Conservative Party who have been vocal critics of her plan, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on whose support she relies on in parliament.

The BBC reported that eight senior ministers had met on Monday evening to discuss the issue and had expressed concern that any 'backstop plan' to avoid a hard border after Britain leaves the bloc next March should be time-limited. The EU has refused to set an end date.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2018 01:28AM ET</span>",Australian PM faces backlash over surprise shift in Israel policy,"By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose government faces a crucial by-election that could weaken its grip on power, said on Tuesday Canberra was open to recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and shifting its embassy there.
Such a move, which would follow U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial decision in December to do just that, would reverse decades of foreign policy and inflame tension with some of Australia's Asian neighbors.
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, and Australia are due to sign a trade deal this year.
Indonesia's trade minister, Enggartiasto Lukita, denied Australian media reports on Tuesday that Jakarta was considering putting the pact on hold over the possibility of Canberra changing its stance on Israel.
Morrison's openness to recognizing Jerusalem and moving Australia's embassy there comes four days before a by-election in Sydney where his center-right coalition faces the risk of losing its tenuous hold on power.
The by-election is in the Sydney harbourside seat of Wentworth vacated by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted in a party-room coup by members of Morrison's Liberal party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition, in August.
Census figures show 12.5 percent of people in Wentworth are Jewish, a significantly larger proportion than the rest of the country. The Liberal candidate contesting the by-election on Saturday is Dave Sharma, a former Australian ambassador to Israel who has floated the idea in the past.
Morrison will have to negotiate with independent lawmakers in order to continue governing in minority if the coalition loses Saturday's by-election.
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper described Morrison's apparent change of heart as ""unprincipled and craven"" and he faced a torrid question time in parliament.
""The orthodoxy that's driven this debate which says issues like considering the question of the capital are taboo. I think we have to challenge that,"" Morrison said earlier in Canberra.
""No decision has been made regarding the recognition of a capital or the movement of an embassy ... but at the same time, what we are simply doing is being open to that suggestion,"" Morrison said.
'PRETTY BLATANT'
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 Middle East war, as its capital.
Australia refused to follow Trump's decision in December, which enraged Palestinians and upset the Arab world and Western allies, and has so far kept its mission in Tel Aviv.
The apparent change of policy was welcomed by Israel but swiftly criticized by Palestinian representatives.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Morrison had telephoned to explain his shift, said on Twitter he was ""very thankful"" Morrison was considering the move.
Palestinians, with broad international backing, want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Peace talks between the parties broke down in 2014.
In a statement, Palestine's embassy in Australia called Morrison's announcement ""deeply disturbing"". It said short-term political gain ""would surely be outweighed by the detriment both to Australia's international standing and in its relations with Arab and Muslim-majority countries"".
The U.S. Embassy became the only foreign embassy in Jerusalem in May, but Netanyahu has attempted to persuade others to follow suit. 
University of Sydney political analyst Rod Tiffen said the shifting position was being driven by local politics. 
""It's a big change, it is out of step with everyone, except America,"" said Tiffen.

""But three days out from the Wentworth by-election, it's pretty blatant ... to the extent that there is a Jewish vote there, it probably helps.""

Hundreds of people chanting ""Keiko is innocent"" marched through downtown Lima to protest against Fujimori's arrest last Wednesday pending charges in a money laundering investigation.
Ana Herz and Pier Figari, Fujimori's top political strategists, were arrested at the demonstration, Ursula Letona, a lawmaker of her party, told journalists.
""They were arrested in the middle of the march,"" Letona said in comments on domestic broadcaster RPP. ""I'm upset. We're victims of the arbitrary arrests of our party leaders."" 
Reuters could not immediately reach attorneys for Herz and Figari to seek comment.
Their arrests were the latest blow to the conservative movement built by former autocrat Alberto Fujimori, Fujimori's father, during his decade in power from 1990 to 2000. 
Since his imprisonment for human rights crimes in 2007, Keiko has led her father's political following. But she failed to win the presidency twice and has seen her popularity plummet as the head of the opposition party that runs Congress.
Fujimori denies any wrongdoing and has said her arrest is part of broader campaign of political persecution against her party and family.
This month, a judge annulled a presidential pardon that had freed Alberto Fujimori from prison late last year. He has been hospitalized since the ruling was announced.
Fujimori's troubles could give President Martin Vizcarra an upper hand in working with Congress, which pressured his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, to resign over graft accusations in March.
Prosecutors allege Fujimori led a criminal organization that sought to use her 2011 presidential campaign to launder illegal funds for Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction group at the center of the region's biggest graft scandal.

Fujimori and her party deny ever taking money from Odebrecht.

ABUJA (Reuters) - A medical aid worker held hostage in Nigeria since March was killed by Islamist militants after their deadline expired, the government said on Monday.
Three aid workers, Hauwa Mohammed Liman, Alice Loksha and Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa, were working in the town of Rann when they were kidnapped by Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA). Khorsa, an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) midwife, was killed in September.
Demands being made in exchange for the release of the hostages have not been reported.
The Nigerian information ministry, in an emailed statement on Monday, did not confirm which of the women had been killed, other than saying it was an aid worker. However, the presidency later said in a Twitter post Information Minister Lai Mohammed commiserated with the family of Hauwa Liman and noted ""that the Federal Government did all within its powers to save her life"".
The militants said in a video posted online last month that they would kill at least one hostage once a deadline due to elapse on Monday had passed. 
The video had also referred to schoolgirl Leah Sharibu, 15, who was abducted in February from her school in the town of Dapchi.
Liman worked in a hospital supported by the ICRC and Loksha as a nurse in a center supported by UNICEF.
""We are deeply pained by this killing, just like we were by the recent killing of the first aid worker. However, we will keep the negotiations open and continue to work to free the innocent women who remain in the custody of their abductors,"" information minister Mohammed said in a statement. 
The ICRC appealed for lives to be spared on Sunday, as the deadline approached.
""We are hearing devastating reports that Hauwa has been executed. At this stage, we have no confirmation that this is true. We desperately hope not. This situation is heartbreaking and our thoughts remain with the family,"" ICRC spokeswoman Krista Armstrong told Reuters in Geneva on Monday. 

ISWA split from Boko Haram in 2016 and has killed hundreds of soldiers in attacks in northeastern Nigeria in the past few months, security and military sources have told Reuters. Like Boko Haram, it wants to create a separate state in northeast Nigeria that adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law.

The poll leader ahead of the Oct. 28 run-off vote could also end overseas financing by state development bank BNDES, Valor reported, citing unnamed campaign sources, as Bolsonaro looks to overhaul the country's state-run entities. 
A longstanding advocate of state control over key strategic assets like government-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, Bolsonaro has recently changed tack, falling more closely in line with key advisors who favor privatizing assets.
But a rival camp of advisors, made up of military generals, have urged Bolsonaro to maintain control of Petrobras and other assets they consider strategic, Reuters reported last week, opening up a split that could disappoint investors who snapped up Petrobras shares in the wake of Bolsonaro's first-round win.
Bolsonaro's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Petrobras shares were up 2.2 percent in late morning trading.
Bolsonaro maintained a wide lead over his leftist rival Fernando Haddad in a second election poll looking at voter intentions for the run-off vote that was published on Monday. The Ibope poll showed that Bolsonaro had 59 percent of voter support, compared to Haddad's 41 percent.
Brazil's production-sharing contract model for its pre-salt oil fields was rolled out by the leftist Workers Party, which ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years, and has been blamed by many for a weak economy and endemic graft.
Reformed by the center-right government of Michel Temer, who took office in 2016 after former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, the production-sharing model has proved successful in recent auctions, luring oil majors like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), Repsol (MC:REP) SA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc.
Higher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted oil majors' appetites for costlier offshore ventures, pumping much-needed money into Brazil's coffers.
The Valor article did not give details on how Bolsonaro would tweak the production-sharing model, but cited campaign sources who said the aim was to attack some of the political abuses perpetrated by previous administrations.
Under Rousseff, Brazil's government used the BNDES to offer loans to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and Mozambique that they would use to contract Brazilian firms. 
The Brazilian government, under Rousseff, had agreed to act as the guarantor of the loans. The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms.

In May, Brazil said it would continue to insist Venezuela and Mozambique pay back nearly 1 billion reais ($281.05 million) in loans they defaulted on to BNDES and Switzerland's  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi appointed Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed to replace Ahmed bin Dagher, who was to be investigated over the ""negligence of his government"", the statement said.
Yemen is one of the poorest Arab nations and as a result of the war, three-quarters of its population, or 22 million people, require aid and 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation.
Its northern half including the capital Sanaa is largely controlled by the northern Shi'ite Houthi rebel movement, while Hadi, whom a Saudi-led Arab military coalition is trying to restore to power, contests much of the south with separatist groups.
""This (the dismissal) was a result of negligence by the government in the recent period with respect to the economy and to administrative services,"" the statement said.
Saeed has been minister of public works in the cabinet, which operates from Saudi Arabia, since last year.
Bin Dagher has been at odds with the southern separatists and their main backer, the United Arab Emirates, a member of the Saudi-led coalition, which has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.
Bin Dagher tweeted his congratulations to Saeed.
Most Yemenis now live in Houthi-controlled territory, while Hadi government controls the south, backed by a Saudi-led coalition of Arab troops.
The Yemeni currency, the riyal, has lost more than half its value against the dollar since the start of the war. Authorities sought to boost liquidity last year by printing money when it stood at around 250 to the dollar, but it has now plunged in value to about 700 to the dollar.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A British academic has been charged for spying in the United Arab Emirates, UAE authorities said on Monday, five months after he was arrested at the end of a study trip.
Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, was arrested on May 5 at Dubai airport after a two-week visit and has been kept in solitary confinement since then, his wife Daniela Tejada said last week.
""The Attorney General of United Arab Emirates ... confirmed today that Mr. Matthew Hedges, a British Citizen, has been charged with spying for and on behalf of a foreign State, jeopardizing the military, economy and political security of the UAE,"" the government said in a statement.
Investigators had gathered evidence from Hedges' electronic devices and intelligence from UAE security agencies, the statement said.
The British Foreign Office did not immediately reply for a request for comment. British authorities have said they raised Hedges' case with the UAE previously.
Hedges appeared at a court in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi last week, after a first hearing earlier this month, but was not informed of any charges, his wife, Daniela Tejada, said, adding that she had been told his trial would resume on Oct. 24.
""Matt was in the UAE to carry out academic research for his PhD. Since he was detained on May 5, 2018 he has only ever been granted two consular visits which is in direct violation of his rights,"" she said. 
According Durham University's website, Hedges is a doctoral student in the School of Government and International Affairs whose research interests include civil-military relations, political economy and tribalism.
Last year, he co-authored an article in an academic journal on the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member.

ANKARA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump speculated on Monday that ""rogue killers"" may have been behind the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet King Salman over the case.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, Washington Post columnist and leading critic of the powerful Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago to get marriage documents. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed.
Saudi Arabia is preparing a report that would say Khashoggi was killed as the result of an interrogation that went wrong, CNN reported on Monday, citing two unidentified sources. The Saudi government could not immediately be reached for comment on the CNN report. 
The New York Times, citing a person familiar with the Saudi plans, reported that Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved an interrogation or rendition of Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government, it said, would shield the prince by blaming an intelligence official for the botched operation.
The case has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, with more media and business executives pulling out of a planned investment conference there this month. 
While organizers said Monday the conference will go on, the Saudis canceled an annual diplomatic reception in Washington set for later this week.
Many members of the U.S. Congress, which has long had a testy relationship with Saudi Arabia, have issued strong criticism of the kingdom over the case. 
Turkish authorities have an audio recording indicating that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, a Turkish official and a security source told Reuters, and have shared evidence with countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States. They provided no further details. 
Saudi Arabia has strongly denied killing Khashoggi and has denounced such assertions as ""lies"", saying he left the building shortly after entering.
""The king firmly denied any knowledge of it,"" Trump told reporters after speaking with King Salman. ""He didn't really know, maybe - I don't want to get into his mind but it sounded to me - maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?""
The U.S. president gave no evidence to support the theory.
Trump called his top diplomat on Sunday night and asked him to have face-to-face meetings with the Saudi leaders, according to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. ""Determining what happened to Jamal Khashoggi is something of great importance to the president,"" she said.
Pompeo will go to Turkey from Saudi Arabia, the White House National Security Council said.
Turkish police investigators entered the Istanbul consulate late on Monday. A Turkish diplomatic source had earlier said a joint Turkish-Saudi team would search the building - the last place Khashoggi was seen before he vanished on Oct. 2.
""It has been 13 days since the event, so surely proving some of the evidence might be difficult, but we believe we will obtain evidence,"" the Turkish official said.
A Saudi official, not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters that the king had ordered an internal investigation based on information from the joint team in Istanbul.
King Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone on Sunday evening and stressed the importance of the two countries creating a joint group as part of the probe.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he has ruled out cancelling arms deals worth tens of billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia. European allies have urged ""a credible investigation"" and accountability for those responsible.
Britain expects Riyadh to provide ""a complete and detailed response"" to questions over Khashoggi's disappearance, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said on Monday. 
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt told his Turkish counterpart Khashoggi's disappearance remains ""deeply concerning.""
Khashoggi, a familiar face on Arab talk shows, moved to the United States last year fearing retribution for his criticism of Prince Mohammed, who has cracked down on dissent with arrests.
A pro-government Turkish daily published preliminary evidence last week from investigators who it said had identified a 15-member Saudi intelligence team that arrived in Istanbul on diplomatic passports hours before Khashoggi disappeared.
The Saudi consulate referred Reuters to authorities in Riyadh, who did not respond to questions about the 15 Saudis. 
Saudi Arabia has responded to Western statements by saying it would retaliate against any pressure or economic sanctions ""with greater action,"" and Arab allies rallied to support it, setting up a potential showdown between Saudi Arabia and its main Western allies.
The Saudi riyal fell to its lowest in two years and its international bond prices slipped over fears that foreign investment could shrink amid international pressure.
The Saudi stock market had tumbled 7.2 percent over the previous two trading days but rebounded 2 percent on Monday.
BACKLASH
Concern over Khashoggi's disappearance has seen media organizations and a growing number of guests pull out of a ""Davos in the Desert"" investment conference set for Oct. 23-25, which has become the biggest show for investors to promote Prince Mohammed's reform vision.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon became the most high-profile banker to withdraw from the event on Sunday night. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink also were pulling out, according to a source familiar with the matter. Both companies declined comment. 
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund which hosts the conference, has tentatively committed $20 billion to an infrastructure investment planned with Blackstone Group. Prince Mohammed told Reuters last year that Blackstone and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) were planning to open offices in the kingdom.
The organizer insisted the conference would go ahead, with more than 150 speakers confirmed. 
Saudi Arabia's Arab allies have rushed to its support.
Bahrain called for a boycott of Uber, in which PIF has invested $3.5 billion, after its chief executive officer said he would not attend the conference.

Similar campaigns trended on social media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

YANGON (Reuters) - Dozens of Myanmar garment workers were injured on Monday after a clash with assailants wielding iron bars outside a Chinese-owned factory in Yangon, witnesses and hospital staff said.
Hundreds of employees of Fu Yuen Garment Co Ltd, which has produced clothes for German supermarket chain Lidl and British fashion brand Joules, according to shipment records published by global trade data website Panjiva, have been striking for weeks demanding the reinstatement of 30 sacked workers. 
Myanmar’s textile industry is the country’s top export earner after oil and gas, employing more than 450,000 people and generating more than $2 billion in exports last year. 
Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the sector could soon be at risk as the European Union considers whether to reinstate economic sanctions over the Rohingya crisis, potentially stripping the country of tariff-free access to the trading bloc.
A spokesman for Lidl told Reuters the company was liaising with the supplier to investigate the claims. ""Once we have obtained all of the facts, we will make an assessment of the situation and take action, if necessary,"" he said in an email. 
A spokeswoman for Joules said the brand stopped working with the factory in April 2018.
Staff at Fu Yuen Ltd, in Dagon Seikkan township on the outskirts of the commercial capital of Yangon, have been demonstrating since August, after 30 members of a committee that had been campaigning for better conditions for workers were fired. 
“They want to crush the committee,” said Hla Ohn Mar, 21, one of the sacked leaders, speaking in the emergency department of Thingangyun hospital, which was crowded with young workers on Monday afternoon.
Twenty-four people were admitted for treatment, the head of the hospital, Dr Aung San Min, told Reuters. “We are treating six as in-patients,” he said.
Workers said about 20 to 30 men in civilian clothing rounded on the crowd of mostly young women gathered outside the factory gates in the early hours of Monday.
“Those guys are gangsters,” said one of the injured workers, 21-year-old Thae Nu Khaing, as trickles of blood ran down her forehead, one leg bandaged in a plaster cast.
“They pushed me and beat my leg with a metal stick,” she said. “I wasn’t afraid – I was just angry and crying.” 
Police blamed workers for the violence, saying in a statement a fight had broken out after a small group urged employees still working at the factory to participate in the protest. 
""Both groups have an argument and violence happened,"" the statement said. 
Win Myint, an officer from Dagon Seikkan township station, said officers had been deployed to guard the area but no one had been arrested.
Contacted by Reuters, the township administrator referred questions to Fu Yuen, which could not be reached for comment.

MINSK (Reuters) - The Russian Orthodox Church said on Monday it had decided to sever all relations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in protest over its endorsement of Ukraine's request for an ""autocephalous"", or independent, church.
Speaking in Belarus after a meeting of the Russian Church's ruling body, Metropolitan Ilarion, a cleric, said the Holy Synod had been left with no choice but to sever ties with the Patriarchate in Istanbul, seat of the global spiritual leader of roughly 300 million Orthodox Christians.
Ukraine last week secured approval from Constantinople to establish an independent church in what Kiev said was a vital step against Russian meddling in its affairs, but that the Russian Orthodox Church lamented as the biggest split in Christianity for a thousand years.
""A decision was taken to completely sever ties,"" Metropolitan Ilarion told reporters in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, announcing Russian retaliation against Constantinople. 
""No other decision could have been taken by our Holy Synod because the logic of all the actions taken recently by the Constantinople Patriarchate led to this.""
The Russian Orthodox Church has compared Ukraine's moves for independence to the Great Schism of 1054 that split western and eastern Christianity, and warned they could lead to an irreversible rupture in the global Orthodox community.
Ilarion said Constantinople's decision to back the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's independence drive was illegal and that the Russian Orthodox Church would disregard it.
""We are hoping common sense will prevail and that the Constantinople Patriarchate will change its relations to existing church reality,"" he said.
The tussle over Ukraine's spiritual future flows from the poisoning of relations between Kiev and Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine's east that has killed over 10,000 people.
The Moscow Patriarchate, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, long dominated in Ukraine but since the 1991 Soviet break-up has been challenged by a rival known as the Kiev Patriarchate.
Ukraine accuses the Russian Orthodox Church of wielding a pernicious influence on its soil, allowing itself to be used as a tool of the Kremlin to justify Russian expansionism and support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

The Moscow Patriarchate denies its church is a security threat to Ukraine and, far from being a Kremlin stooge, says it has done much to promote peace in the country's east.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Sixty people were killed after a fire broke out on Friday on an oil pipeline in the southeast of Nigeria, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said on Monday, up from the tally of 16 dead given by officials three days earlier.
The state oil company on Friday said pumping on the System 2E pipeline network had been halted. 
""We will resume the pumping of products very soon,"" NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu told Reuters on Monday. ""We had put out the fire. We are now pumping water in the pipeline to detect other possible areas of leakages.""
The System 2E pipeline is a key network that supplies imported gasoline and output from the Port Harcourt refineries to much of the southeast and north of the country. The two refining plants at Port Harcourt operate far below their 210,000 barrels per day capacity. 
In an emailed statement, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it had been prevented from pumping fuel to the southeastern Enugu Depot ""which has remained underutilized despite its recent rehabilitation by the NNPC"".
Many oil spills in the southern oil production heartland of Africa's biggest crude producer are caused by theft and pipeline sabotage. The methods used to steal the oil often result in accidents that cause fires.
The state oil company , which on Friday gave a death toll of 16, said the fire had been caused by pipeline vandals who breached the pipeline in Ososioma near the southeastern city of Aba.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",France says it could help North Korea denuclearize if it sees real commitment,"By John Irish and Marine Pennetier
PARIS (Reuters) - France is ready to help in North Korea's denuclearization efforts, but Pyongyang must first show some detailed commitments and real desire to dismantle its nuclear and ballistic arsenal, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday.
France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, is not directly involved in talks between North Korea, South Korea and the United States to work toward the region's denuclearization.
However, diplomats have said that given Paris' nuclear know-how it could play a role in the dismantling of nuclear warheads or receiving nuclear materials.
""We are waiting for precise commitments from Pyongyang to demonstrate its real desire to engage in a dismantlement of its nuclear and ballistic programs,"" Macron told a news conference alongside his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in.
""We are ready to put forward our expertise and play an active role if a negotiation process is started."" 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged at a landmark summit in Singapore in June to work toward denuclearization.
But the agreement was short on specifics and talks have made little headway since, with the North refusing to declare its nuclear weapons and facilities or agree to a concrete timeline.
""We have scientific, technical, operational, nuclear expertise which, in the context of a denuclearization, is very useful and which we want to make available if it appears to be relevant,"" Macron said. 
Moon said in an interview on Sunday that Kim was sincere in abandoning nuclear weapons. Speaking alongside Macron, he said it was crucial countries on the Security Council give North Korea confidence that ""it had made the right decision"" to give up its weapons program.
Macron said that Security Council resolutions needed to remain in place and should only evolve with a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization process.
While Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests this year, it failed to keep its promise to allow international inspections of its dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in May, stirring criticism that the move could be reversed.
The reclusive communist state has no official diplomatic relations with France, one of only two European Union countries along with Estonia to cut ties with North Korea until it abandons its nuclear weapons program and improves its human rights record.
""Depending on how this evolves ... we will envisage on the one hand changes in terms of our bilateral diplomatic relations and on the other hand changes to sanctions policy,"" Macron said.

""I think it's good to keep seep some pressure levers to make sure there are changes,"" he said.

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","With talks deadlocked, May says Irish backstop cannot derail Brexit talks","By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Monday not to allow a stand-off over the so-called Irish backstop to derail Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was still achievable in the coming weeks.
Addressing a rowdy session of parliament before she headed to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday, May was upbeat about the chances of a deal, but repeated she would not agree to anything that could split the United Kingdom.
With less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc, talks stalled at the weekend over how to ensure there is no return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
The stalemate has increased the possibility of Britain leaving the bloc without an agreement, a ""no deal Brexit"" which could potentially disrupt trade, delay movement of goods, and starve the world's fifth largest economy of investment.
""It is frustrating that almost all the remaining points of disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario which both sides hope should never come to pass and which, if it does, would only be temporary,"" May said.
""We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a good deal and leave us with a 'no-deal' outcome that no-one wants,"" she told parliament. 
Underlining the economic importance of Brexit, the head of British-headquartered pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca said it would keep its freeze on manufacturing investments in the country unless a deal provides clarity about future ties.
DIVISIONS ON SHOW
The 2016 referendum on membership of the EU deeply divided Britain, and those rifts were on show in parliament, where May received more demands for reassurance than words of support from lawmakers, even those in her own Conservative Party.
May tried to explain the obstacles, which she described as largely technical, that had scuppered any hope of agreement in the talks in Brussels on Sunday.
She said the EU had stuck to a proposal of keeping Northern Ireland in its customs union if a UK-wide plan was not ready to be put in place when a transitional arrangement runs out at the end of 2020.
May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop must be temporary, ending at the latest in December 2021, but the EU has refused to set an end date.
May described that as asking for ""a backstop to a backstop"" and said again Northern Ireland could not be treated differently from the rest of Britain.
""As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no matter how unlikely such a scenario may be,"" she said.
But May still faces a struggle to ease the concerns of not only the EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in parliament, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
The DUP's Nigel Dodds pressed May for new reassurance that she will stand by her words about Britain leaving as one country, rolling his eyes when she answered by repeating familiar phrases.
May also needs to try to keep euroskeptics in her party on board. Her former foreign minister turned loudest critic, Boris Johnson, pressed her to put a firm time limit on any backstop, fearful it could keep Britain in the EU's sphere indefinitely.
EU leaders expressed disappointment that the backstop row had sunk the possibility of a deal at the weekend, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying ""at the moment it actually looks a bit more difficult"".
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now ""take a bit more time than many people had hoped"".
But a spokesman for May expressed hope, saying there were ""a number of means of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the backstop, but declined to give details.
And, in a change of tone, Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, said she also hoped for a ""sensible"" Brexit.

""I very much hope that we do get a deal,"" she told reporters. ""We want to see a sensible Brexit, one that works for Northern Ireland, but also one that works for our colleagues and friends in the Republic of Ireland.""

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Border blockade: Irish riddle defies creative Brexit minds,"By Francesco Guarascio, Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brains, sweat and toil over the past week brought British and EU civil servants to the brink of a Brexit deal at the weekend, but in the end the painful history and fraught future of a divided Ireland defeated them.
EU sources familiar with events in the European Commission's Brussels headquarters over the weekend told Reuters more work was needed on the so-called Irish ""backstop"". But it is now mostly up to political leaders to unravel a knot that has defied the creativity of Europe's finest diplomatic brains. 
""There is only so much we can do,"" said an EU diplomat. ""The Brits are not ready, they need more time,"" he added.
He echoed a widely held view that British Prime Minister Theresa May needs more of a sense of political crisis at home in order to persuade hardline political allies to give up the last concessions needed for agreement.
Teams led by Oliver Robbins, May's Europe adviser, and Sabine Weyand, German deputy to French chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, worked long hours, often into the night, over the past week and were still thrashing over ways to bridge gaps late on Saturday in the hope of an Irish solution.
But by early Sunday, despite clearing out conflicts on other issues in what diplomats called an atmosphere of rising mutual appreciation, it seemed the Irish border was a bridge too far.
London was still loath to endorse even the most modest insurance clause that might one day treat Northern Ireland differently from the British mainland in the interest of keeping the fragile province's land border open, a key aspect of the 1998 peace deal that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed.
May's ""backstop"" solution remained keeping the whole of the United Kingdom inside the EU customs area longer than planned until a new UK-EU trade deal is agreed that would ensure there is no friction on the Ireland-Northern Ireland border - but with a get-out clause to avoid this backstop becoming permanent.
The Europeans had scaled back demands on Ireland as far as they could, offering to extend the whole United Kingdom's place inside the EU customs area by a year and keep any checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland discreet. 
But they could not agree to sign a withdrawal treaty that leaves the Irish border issue dependent on the uncertain result of future talks on EU-UK trade relations. The British complained that the EU wanted a ""backstop to the backstop"" and said No.
Addressing the British parliament on Monday, May urged the EU not to allow a stand-off over the Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable.
SUMMIT WEEK
When May's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab flew in to meet Barnier in late afternoon on Sunday to formally convey Britain's red line on the backstop, that meeting not only did nothing to ease the impasse but, said EU sources, seemed to reopen other issues that the technical negotiators thought were closed.
Leaders of the other 27 EU states will now meet over dinner in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss how to proceed. They have invited May to speak to them ahead of their regular EU summit on Thursday but they will try not to negotiate with her.
They will take account of a briefing from Barnier to their Europe ministers on Tuesday in Luxembourg, and any new moves from May, who told parliament in London on Monday that the Irish backstop blockage should not derail Brexit talks. 
Some, notably including French President Emmanuel Macron, want to press Britain - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May's minority government - to give ground, in part by stepping up planning for a ""no deal"" outcome next March, widely seen as risking economic upheaval.
Other leaders, say diplomats involved in discussions among envoys on Brexit tactics, warned after the weekend debacle to go easy and not repeat the kind of angry cross-Channel rhetoric that followed their last summit with May in Salzburg last month.
For now, the line for EU negotiators is, in an echo of a classic British expression, ""keep calm and carry on"", hoping that the politicians can find a way to get out of their hole.

""It may take longer for the panic around a no-deal to sink in and, hopefully, soften the DUP line,"" said an EU diplomat. ""And there has never been an EU deal done before the 11th hour.""

By Nelson Renteria
SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - In 1980, a day after urging El Salvador's military to halt a string of abuses that would inflame a 12-year civil war in the impoverished country, Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero was shot dead while leading Mass.
His homilies had blasted the U.S.-backed military dictatorship while voicing solidarity with the poor, making him a Latin American human rights icon.
On Sunday at the Vatican, he will become a Roman Catholic saint.
Romero was considered for canonization decades ago, but his nomination stalled on concerns that he was overly political.
His reputation rebounded in 2015, when Pope Francis, a fellow Latin American committed to defending the poor, declared him a martyr who had been killed for hatred of the faith.
Romero critiqued the military government and armed leftist groups alike. That earned him animosity from both sides ahead of a civil war that lasted until 1992, leaving some 75,000 people dead and sending thousands of Salvadorans fleeing to the United States.
In 1980, at a church altar, he found a bomb meant to take his life.
""Persecution is necessary in the Church. Do you know why? Because the truth is always persecuted,"" he said at the time. 
Two weeks later, undeterred by death threats, the man distinguished by his bushy eyebrows and thick glasses spoke directly to soldiers.
""I beg you, I beseech you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression,"" he said.
The following day, a sniper killed the 62-year-old as he delivered Mass at a hospital chapel in the capital. The main suspect is a former soldier.
Romero's murder was one of the most shocking of the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in which right-wing and military death squads killed thousands.
CARPENTRY TO SAINTHOOD
Romero was born in 1917 in a small coffee-growing town in El Salvador, the second of eight brothers. As a boy, he apprenticed as a carpenter before entering the seminary and studying theology in Rome.
In 1943, he returned to El Salvador as a parish priest until becoming Archbishop of San Salvador in 1977. The military's killing, kidnapping and arrests of priests who supported workers' rights turned him into a staunch critic of the regime. 
The Vatican said the miracle cementing his sainthood was the 2015 survival of Cecilia Flores, whose husband prayed to Romero when she was close to death in pregnancy.
""Doctors told my husband ... only a miracle will save your wife,"" Flores said. After her husband began praying, she instantly recovered and gave birth to a healthy son, she added. 
Salvadoran Cardinal Jose Gregorio Rosa said Romero's sainthood will serve as an example for religious leaders as well as the faithful.

""It's the greatest thing a human being can achieve, an incredible joy,"" he said.

This is the third attempt by the Socialist Party (BSP) to topple the ruling coalition this year and like the previous ones it is likely to fail as the center-right government has a small majority in parliament.
The Socialists, who have 79 seats in the 240-seat parliament, have not secured the backing of any other party. 
Their leader, Kornelia Ninova, said the BSP wanted to underline the dire state of healthcare services in the Balkan country and the failure of the government, in office since May 2017, to improve the situation.
""Hundreds of thousands Bulgarians cannot get medical treatment because they have no access to a doctor or a hospital or do not have money for treatment,"" Ninova told reporters. 
The Socialists also pointed to the exodus of doctors and nurses abroad due to low pay at home, inefficient management and the high debt levels of state and municipal hospitals. 
The motion comes at a time when the health ministry has opened a public debate on reforms needed to improve health care services.
""We have seen that the model only with fuelling more money is not enough, maybe the system needs a restart and we will find the right formula,"" said Alexander Ivanov, a lawmaker with ruling center-right GERB party. 

The motion is expected to be debated and voted on this week or next, he said.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Turkey dismisses 259 local officials for suspected terrorist links,"By Gulsen Solaker
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has dismissed 259 local officials for suspected links to terrorist groups or unsuitable behavior, the government said on Monday, a move the pro-Kurdish opposition said was aimed at helping the ruling AK Party ahead of 2019 polls. 
The elected officials, known as ""mukhtars"", serve as the lowest administrative authority in Turkey. Although not officially members of any political party, they are influential in decision-making in their villages and local districts.
The officials were dismissed pending an investigation, the Interior Ministry said, adding they were suspected of links to groups that threaten Turkey's security or of behavior not befitting their duties. It did not elaborate on the charges.
The ministry did not give a geographic breakdown of the dismissals, but a parliamentarian from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the move was the latest attempt by President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party to curtail the HDP's influence in the largely Kurdish southeast.
""Following the arrest of municipality heads from the HDP, the appointment of trustees to municipalities and the removal of immunity and arrest of parliamentarians, it is now the mukhtars' turn,"" Meral Danis Bestas said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for the HDP said she did not know how many of the dismissed officials came from the southeast.
Some 94 of 102 municipalities in Kurdish-majority cities and towns are now administered by trustees rather than by their elected mayors. Authorities removed those mayors, elected in the last municipal elections in 2014, in a security crackdown that followed an attempted military coup in 2016.
Erdogan has said the government would appoint trustees to any municipalities held by the HDP after March 2019 local elections.
Erdogan and his AK Party say the HDP has links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a militant group that has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. The HDP denies accusations of links to the PKK and says it is being unjustly targeted by the government. 
Last week the government dismissed 559 village guards for suspected terrorist links and another 76 for suspected involvement in human and drug smuggling. 
Village guards are locals armed and paid by the state to protect their communities, mostly in the east and the southeast. They are frequent targets for PKK militants. 
The PKK is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and Europe.

""There is a presence of soldiers on the streets and they are trying to remove the barricades but the people are blocking the streets again as soon as they leave,"" he told Reuters by phone. 
President Assoumani a former military officer, joins a string of African leaders in countries such as Rwanda, Uganda and Cameroon who have extended presidential term limits or amended the constitution in order to remain in power. 
In August, Assoumani - from the island of Grande Comore - said a June referendum had resulted in the extension of presidential term limits and an end to the rotating presidency. The opposition called the referendum illegal.
Under the old system, the island of Anjouan would have been in line to hold the presidency in 2021. 
The ""yes"" vote allows Assoumani to run for two more, five-year terms, starting from the early election next year, rather than being required to step down when his present term ends in 2021.
Security officials said Anjouan's Mutsamudu and Ouani ports remained open despite the unrest, but that the movement of soldiers was being prevented by the barricades.

Last month, prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for former vice president Jaffar Ahmed Said Hassani - who had openly opposed the plebiscite - on charges of plotting against the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday dispatched U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with Saudi Arabia's King Salman over the unexplained disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and raised the possibility that ""rogue killers"" could have been responsible.
Trump said he spoke to the Saudi king for about 20 minutes about Khashoggi, who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, and that it sounded like neither the king nor Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had knowledge about the incident. 
Turkish sources have said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the building and his body removed, allegations that Riyadh dismisses as baseless. 
""I sounded to me like maybe there could have been rogue killers. Who knows?"" Trump told reporters at the White House. He offered no evidence for why he thought rogue killers might be involved.
Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. 
Pompeo will travel to Riyadh, the U.S. State Department said, 
""The president has called for a prompt and open investigation into the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
""We are going to leave nothing uncovered,"" Trump told reporters.
Salman's denial, however, ""could not have been stronger,"" he added. 
At the weekend, Trump threatened ""severe punishment"" for Riyadh if it turned out Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi authorities and a legal resident of the United States, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia, in turn, threatened to retaliate. 
But Trump has said he is wary of halting U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia over the incident.
Earlier on Monday, Salman ordered an internal probe into Khashoggi's disappearance while a joint Turkish-Saudi team was set to search the consulate.

Trump said the king told him on Monday that the two countries were working very closely on the case.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Monday to restore trust in her government after her conservative allies suffered heavy losses in a regional election, which their far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake"" that would rock the ruling coalition.
The Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Merkel's own Christian Democrats (CDU), slumped to its worst result in almost 70 years in Sunday's election in Bavaria. The chancellor's other coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), saw its support halved.
""My lesson from this is that I, as chancellor, must make sure that trust is won back. I will work on that with as much vigour as I can,"" she said at an event of the BGA trade body.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in Merkel's loveless coalition, had hoped his anti-immigration rhetoric and criticism of Merkel's liberal asylum policies would help his party fend off a threat from the far-right in Bavaria.
His strategy backfired as the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for almost six decades, bled votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the ecologist Greens in equal measure. On Monday, he appeared to extend an olive branch. 
""We will do our bit to ensure that the coalition can continue to do its work in a stable manner despite some of the comments that were made yesterday,"" Seehofer told reporters.
He was referring to angry CSU delegates who blamed their party's dismal showing on Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim, asylum seekers, which has fuelled the rise of the AfD.
Merkel said the CSU had lost its absolute majority in the Bavarian parliament even though the regional economy was doing well.
""This shows that even a good economic situation and almost full employment are not sufficient if trust is lacking,"" Merkel said.
The Bavarian economy grew by 2.8 percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent. It also has the lowest unemployment rate in Germany, 2.8 percent, compared with just over 5 percent nationally. 
The AfD gleefully seized on the election outcome as a sign of a broader malaise for Merkel's coalition, which has been shaken by disputes, including over immigration, since it took power seven months ago.
""We are very pleased because the goal for the Bavaria state election was to send an earthquake towards Berlin,"" Martin Sichert, AfD leader in Bavaria, told a news conference. ""This earthquake happened .... We are now excited to see what the consequences will be here in Berlin.""
The CSU also lost support to the Free Voters, a protest party of mainly conservative independents.
In Bavaria, the CSU will now try to form a coalition either with the Free Voters - its preferred option - or with the Greens who are ideologically distant.
""PAINFUL""
The ruling coalition was borne of necessity rather than choice after an inconclusive general election in September 2017.
The Bavarian election was also a wake-up call for the SPD, which saw its support halve to just under 10 percent, prompting a discussion over the sustainability of its alliance at national level with Merkel's conservative bloc.
SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to join the government after vowing before the 2017 election to sit in opposition if they lost to the conservatives. They are now demanding consequences.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's losses in Bavaria on infighting at national level between the CDU and CSU.
""It is obvious that the whole style of our cooperation must change,"" she told reporters. ""We urgently need to work on the style and communication and also on substantive progress."" 
Polls suggest the ruling parties will again be punished in two weeks' time in an election in the western state of Hesse, where they are expected to lose voters to the AfD and the Greens.
The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would almost certainly further weaken the chancellor's authority.
Merkel, who has been in power since 2005 and is Europe's most powerful leader, then faces further potential pitfalls in the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in early December.
The 64-year-old Merkel has won support from key conservatives in her bid for re-election as CDU chairwoman at the congress. But this could change if the CDU loses Hesse to an SPD-Greens coalition.

""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's position,"" wrote mass-selling newspaper Bild.

Mounir El Motassadeq was a member of a group of radical Islamists based in the northern German port city of Hamburg who helped bring about the suicide attacks with hijacked airliners that killed nearly 3,000 people. 
Handed the maximum sentence of 15 years in 2007 for being an accessory to mass murder, Motassadeq is one of only two men convicted to date of involvement in the plot.
""Everything is going according to plan,"" said a spokesman for the state of Hamburg's interior ministry, declining to give details, other than to say that Motassadeq's release was permissible from Oct. 15 if he was deported immediately. 
Photographs showed a man with covered eyes being led by two armed policemen to a helicopter. German media reported that he would be taken to Frankfurt to be deported to Morocco, where his family lives.
The spokesman in Hamburg could not say exactly when his sentence was due to end. German media have reported he was due to stay behind bars until November or early next year.
At his 2007 trial, his lawyers argued that Motassadeq knew nothing about the Sept. 11 plot. But prosecutors said he played a central role in suicide hijacker Mohammed Atta's group by running the financial affairs of some cell members. 

Authorities in Hamburg said they would confirm the deportation once it has taken place.

A general election on Sept. 9 delivered a hung parliament with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats holding the balance of power, although neither the center-left nor center-right bloc is willing to do a deal with them.
Moderate Party and center-right Alliance bloc leader Ulf Kristersson had a first stab at forming a government but failed.
Lofven's chances look little better.
""The parties have to rethink where they stand if we are going to get further in this process,"" Speaker Andreas Norlen said.
Lofven, who has two weeks to find a workable government, lost a vote of no-confidence as prime minister on Sept. 25.
His center-left bloc of the Social Democrats, Greens and Left party has 144 seats in the 349-member parliament, one more than the center-right Alliance. 
The Sweden Democrats, with roots in the white supremacist fringe, have 62 seats. 
Lofven is hoping to get support from the Centre and Liberal parties - currently part of the Alliance bloc.
Those two parties scuppered Kristersson's attempt at forming a government over the weekend, saying his proposals would leave the government needing support from the Sweden Democrats.
The leaders of the Centre and Liberal parties, however, said they still wanted to see Kristersson as prime minister, backed by broad bipartisan support.

Canada will become the first industrialized nation to legalize the recreational use of cannabis on Wednesday, fulfilling a campaign promise by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals who had argued the move would keep pot out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.
In brightly lighted climate-controlled rooms at Ontario's Niagara College, protected by fences and layers of locked doors, are 50 cannabis clones that students will learn to irrigate, feed, protect, track with bar codes, test for chemical content, harvest and cure, said program coordinator Bill MacDonald.
""They're also learning the business side. If you're growing this crop, how much is it going to cost you? How much labor (will) you need?""
They'll learn cannabis has light needs similar to the chrysanthemum's and feeding similar to a tomato or a pepper. 
""It's an extremely unique plant, and people have a real emotional attachment to it.""
As authorities worry Canada's legal cannabis supply may fall short of demand and fail to choke off the black market, the program is attracting interest, MacDonald said. 
""Licensed producers are already lining up for our graduates.""
Canada’s burgeoning marijuana industry has caught the attention of major retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Canadian unit and other global companies, mainly in the alcohol and beverage industries, who are considering entering the market for cannabis-infused products.

One thing students at Niagara College will not be able to do is make use of their product: All the plants have to be destroyed at the end of the course.

1111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Trump Sending Pompeo to Meet King as Saudis Open Khashoggi Probe,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s sending Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz after the king gave him assurances that his government wasn’t behind the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.
Trump commented on Monday after a Saudi official said the kingdom has begun an investigation ordered by King Salman and could hold people accountable if evidence warrants it. The probe is separate from a joint investigation being undertaken with Turkish officials.
“Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened ‘to our Saudi Arabian citizen,” Trump said on Twitter Monday. “He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find answer. I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with King!
Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened “to our Saudi Arabian citizen.” He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find answer. I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with King!
The U.S. move signals how quickly the crisis over the fate of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and U.S. resident who wrote critically of the kingdom’s leaders, is threatening to damage U.S.-Saudi relations. Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have said they believe he was killed and dismembered inside.
Trump said King Salman issued a “flat denial” that Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi during a 20-minute call.
“All I can do is report what he told me,” Trump told reporters. “The king certainly denied any knowledge of it,” the president added, saying that Pompeo would depart “within an hour or so.”
Saudi Alliance
Trump has built much of his Middle East policy around his close alliance with Saudi Arabia, the first foreign country he visited after taking office in 2017. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has twice visited the president in the Oval Office, most recently in March to kick off a glitzy investment tour of the U.S. that included stops on Wall Street and Hollywood. 
Despite increasing pressure from Congress, Trump said he’s reluctant to cancel multibillion-dollar arms sales to the kingdom out of concern the U.S. ally will turn to Russia or China instead. But a range of other punishments are under discussion within the administration, from downgrading diplomatic relations or sanctioning Saudi officials to following major U.S. companies in withdrawing officials from an investment conference in Riyadh this month.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned Sunday of “stern action” by Trump if Saudi Arabia is found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance. “If the Saudis are involved, if Khashoggi was killed or harmed or whatever bad outcome here, he will take action. That has been his strategy. Believe what he says,” Kudlow said on “Fox News Sunday.”
Saudi Warning
Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would retaliate against any punitive measures with even “stronger ones,” according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. In a reference to the kingdom’s oil wealth, the statement noted how the Saudi economy “has an influential and vital role in the global economy.”
The Saudi ambassador left Washington last week to return to Riyadh, and one U.S. official said he was instructed by Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton to return to the U.S. with answers about Khashoggi’s disappearance.
Trump is under mounting pressure from Congress. Several Republicans have said arms sales should be curtailed, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said last week that he had warned the Saudis that their relationship with the U.S. risked collapsing.
On Sunday, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another member of the Foreign Relations panel, said that Trump risked sacrificing the moral high ground with other misbehaving foreign leaders.
“If this is proven to be true, there is going to be a response from Congress. It’s going to be nearly unanimous. It’s going to be swift. And it’s going to go pretty far,” Rubio added."

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 09:45AM ET</span>","Fleeing hardship at home, Venezuelan migrants struggle abroad, too","By Alexandra Ulmer
VILLA DEL ROSARIO, Colombia (Reuters) - Every few minutes, the reeds along the Tachira River rustle. Smugglers, in ever growing numbers, emerge with a ragtag group of Venezuelan migrants – men struggling under tattered suitcases, women hugging bundles in blankets and schoolchildren carrying backpacks. They step across rocks, wade into the muddy stream and cross illegally into Colombia.
This is the new migration from Venezuela.
For years, as conditions worsened in the Andean nation's ongoing economic meltdown, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans – those who could afford to – fled by airplane and bus to other countries far and near, remaking their lives as legal immigrants. 
Now, hyperinflation, daily power cuts and worsening food shortages are prompting those with far fewer resources to flee, braving harsh geography, criminal handlers and increasingly restrictive immigration laws to try their luck just about anywhere.
In recent weeks, Reuters spoke with dozens of Venezuelan migrants traversing their country's Western border to seek a better life in Colombia and beyond. Few had more than the equivalent of a handful of dollars with them.
""It was terrible, but I needed to cross,"" said Dario Leal, 30, recounting his journey from the coastal state of Sucre, where he worked in a bakery that paid about $2 per month.
At the border, he paid smugglers nearly three times that to get across and then prepared, with about $3 left, to walk the 500 km (311 miles) to Bogota, Colombia's capital. The smugglers, in turn, paid a fee to Colombian crime gangs who allow them to operate, according to police, locals and smugglers themselves.
As many as 1.9 million Venezuelans have emigrated since 2015, according to the United Nations. Combined with those who preceded them, a total of 2.6 million are believed to have left the oil-rich country. Ninety percent of recent departures, the U.N. says, remain in South America.
The exodus, one of the biggest mass migrations ever on the continent, is weighing on neighbors. Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, which once welcomed Venezuelan migrants, recently tightened entry requirements. Police now conduct raids to detain the undocumented. 
In early October, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Colombia's foreign minister, said as many as four million Venezuelans could be in the country by 2021, costing national coffers as much as $9 billion. ""The magnitude of this challenge,"" he said, ""our country has never seen.""
In Brazil, which also borders Venezuela, the government deployed troops and financing to manage the crush and treat sick, hungry and pregnant migrants. In Ecuador and Peru, workers say that Venezuelan labor lowers wages and that criminals are hiding among honest migrants. 
""There are too many of them,"" said Antonio Mamani, a clothing vendor in Peru, who recently watched police fill a bus with undocumented Venezuelans near Lima. 
""WE NEED TO GO""
By migrating illegally, migrants expose themselves to criminal networks who control prostitution, drug trafficking and other rackets. In August, Colombian investigators discovered 23 undocumented Venezuelans forced into prostitution and living in basements in the colonial city of Cartagena. 
While most migrants are avoiding such straits, no shortage of other hardship awaits – from homelessness, to unemployment, to the cold reception many get as they sleep in public squares, peddle sweets and throng already overburdened hospitals.
Still, most press on, many on foot.
Some join compatriots in Brazil and Colombia. Others, having spent what money they had, are walking vast regions, like Colombia's cold Andean passes and sweltering tropical lowlands, in treks toward distant capitals, like Quito or Lima.
Johana Narvaez, a 36-year-old mother of four, told Reuters her family left after business stalled at their small car repair shop in the rural state of Trujillo. Extra income she made selling food on the street withered because cash is scarce in a country where annual inflation, according to the opposition-led Congress, recently reached nearly 500,000 percent. 
""We can't stay here,"" she told her husband, Jairo Sulbaran, in August, after they ran out of food and survived on corn patties provided by friends. ""Even on foot, we must go."" Sulbaran begged and sold old tires until they could afford bus tickets to the border.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has chided migrants, warning of the hazards of migration and that emigres will end up ""cleaning toilets."" He has even offered free flights back to some in a program called ""Return to the Homeland,"" which state television covers daily.
Most migration, however, remains in the other direction.
Until recently, Venezuelans could enter many South American countries with just their national identity cards. But some are toughening rules, requiring a passport or additional documentation. 
Even a passport is elusive in Venezuela.
Paper shortages and a dysfunctional bureaucracy make the document nearly impossible to obtain, many migrants argue. Several told Reuters they waited two years in vain after applying, while a half-dozen others said they were asked for as much as $2000 in bribes by corrupt clerks to secure one. 
Maduro's government in July said it would restructure Venezuela's passport agency to root out ""bureaucracy and corruption."" The Information Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment. 
""VENEZUELA WILL END UP EMPTY""
Many of those crossing into Colombia pay ""arrastradores,"" or ""draggers,"" to smuggle them along hundreds of trails. Five of the smugglers, all young men, told Reuters business is booming.
""Venezuela will end up empty,"" said Maikel, a 17-year-old Venezuelan smuggler, scratches across his face from traversing the bushy trails. Maikel, who declined to give his surname, said he lost count of how many migrants he has helped cross. 
Colombia, too, struggles to count illegal entries. Before the government tightened restrictions earlier this year, Colombia issued ""border cards"" that let holders crisscross at will. Now, Colombia says it detects about 3,000 false border cards at entry points daily.
Despite tougher patrols along the porous, 2,200-km border, officials say it is impossible to secure outright. ""It's like trying to empty the ocean with a bucket,"" said Mauricio Franco, a municipal official in charge of security in Cucuta, a nearby city. 
And it's not just a matter of rounding up undocumented travelers. 
Powerful criminal groups, long in control of contraband commerce across the border, are now getting their cut of human traffic. Javier Barrera, a colonel in charge of police in Cucuta, said the Gulf Clan and Los Rastrojos, notorious syndicates that operate nationwide, are both involved. 
During a recent Reuters visit to several illegal crossings, Venezuelans carried cardboard, limes and car batteries as barter instead of using the bolivar, their near-worthless currency.
Migrants pay as much as about $16 for the passage. Maikel, the arrastrador, said smugglers then pay gang operatives about $3 per migrant.
For his crossing, Leal, the baker, carried a torn backpack and small duffel bag. His 2015 Venezuelan ID shows a healthier and happier man – before Leal began skimping on breakfast and dinner because he couldn't afford them. 
He rested under a tree, but fretted about Colombian police. ""I'm scared because the ""migra"" comes around,"" he said, using the same term Mexican and Central American migrants use for border police in the United States. 
It doesn't get easier as migrants move on. 
Even if relatives wired money, transfer agencies require a legally stamped passport to collect it. Bus companies are rejecting undocumented passengers to avoid fines for carrying them. A few companies risk it, but charge a premium of as much as 20 percent, according to several bus clerks near the border.
The Sulbaran family walked and hitched some 1200 km to the Andean town of Santiago, where they have relatives. The father toured garages, but found no work. 

""People said no, others were scared,"" said Narvaez, the mother. ""Some Venezuelans come to Colombia to do bad things. They think we're all like that.""

A report, commissioned by the British legislature in March after a string of harassment allegations, said it found institutional failings in the way the House of Commons responded to complaints against lawmakers and staff.
It described a ""culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed.""
Laura Cox, a former British judge who wrote the report, said fundamental and permanent change would need genuine commitment on the part of the leadership of the House of Commons. 
""I find it difficult to envisage how the necessary changes can be successfully delivered, and the confidence of the staff restored, under the current senior House administration.""
In May, a committee of members of parliament voted against launching an investigation into allegations of bullying by the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. His office rejected the claims.
In her report, Cox named no individuals. 
She said that lawmakers should play no part in hearing allegations of harassment involving members of parliament and that the process should be completely independent of them.
""This is not to demonise the entire institution, but unacceptable behaviour by some, whether elected members or House staff, inflicts damage on everyone and undermines the legitimacy and authority of the House of Commons,"" she said. ""Parliament is diminished."" 
The House of Commons issued a statement, saying the wellbeing of staff was its top priority and improvements to its complaints system were under way. 

""Urgent work has already been undertaken to improve internal processes – including the introduction of new confidential support services and helplines run by external, independent specialist providers and a clear pathway for the investigation of allegations,"" it said.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Greek coalition ally threatens to quit if Macedonia name deal goes to parliament,"ATHENS (Reuters) - The leader of a small right-wing party threatened on Monday to pull it out of Greece's governing coalition if a deal settling a row over Macedonia's name comes to parliament, increasing uncertainty in a country that just emerged from bailouts.
Leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Panos Kammenos, leader of the Independent Greeks party, joined forces in 2015 with the stated aim of pulling Greece out of its then-debt crisis and fight corruption that flourished under socialist and conservative rule and pushed Greece to the verge of bankruptcy.
But the new deal Tsipras's government struck with Macedonia that changes its name to North Macedonia has shattered the coalition's honeymoon after Greece's bailout exit in August, refocusing attention on the coalition's contradictions. 
""I won't vote for this deal if it comes to parliament,"" Kammenos, who is defense minister, told state TV ERT after a trip to the United States, where he presented his party's stance and what he called an alternative scenario, if the deal fails. 
""If the parliamentary majority decides a divorce, so be it, there will be one,"" he said, adding that his personal relationship with Tsipras remained ""harmonious.""
Greek nationalists have opposed the name deal, contending that Macedonia is historically Greek and part of Greek heritage.
Greece maintained for 27 years that Macedonia's name implied territorial claims to its northern province of the same name, and so blocked Skopje's path to European Union and NATO membership. The June deal approved by Tsipras removed that obstacle, and has been embraced by both NATO and the EU.
But the deal has been thrown into doubt by the failure of a Macedonian referendum to achieve the minimum turnout needed to uphold the accord. In that light, Kammenos said, the deal is unlikely to come before the Greek parliament for approval.
Greece's coalition government, whose term ends late next year, is backed by 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Kammenos' party holds 7 seats. Tsipras has repeatedly ruled out early elections. 
But in an effort to ease fears of a government collapse if the Macedonia deal comes to the Greek parliament for a vote, government officials have said that support from independent and center-left lawmakers has already been secured.
But Kammenos's comments triggered heated debate, even within Tsipras' leftist Syriza party. During a weekend meeting of its central committee, members said the partnership was unraveling. 
""It's a big political issue when a government partner says he disagrees to the point of being forced to withdraw his confidence in the government,"" senior Syriza official Panos Skourletis said on Monday. 
""This is a big political mistake on his (Kammenos) part.""

But the two countries struck a deal in June under which the ex-Yugoslav republic would become North Macedonia to end a 27-year dispute.
However, a Macedonian referendum on the agreement failed to pass the turnout threshold of 50 percent, leaving it up to the Skopje parliament to settle the issue.
The ruling center-left coalition, which has 72 lawmakers in the 120-seat parliament, needs to secure a two-third majority to pass laws on constitutional changes. The remaining deputies are members of the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE, which also supports EU and NATO membership but opposes changing the country name. 
Debate can proceed for a maximum of 10 days, after which the vote will take place.
""Let’s show the world that above all of our domestic political misunderstandings and conflicts, we have a joint interest - the future of our country,"" Zaev told parliament.
""I call on deputies to think and look into the future, (and consider) whether they want a European Macedonia or isolation, poverty and uncertainty,"" Zaev said. 
He has said that if his government failed to secure majority to change name of the country, he would call new elections. 
Ilija Dimovski of the VMRO-DPMNE said the current parliament lacked the legitimacy to decide on constitutional changes.
""None of the parties discussed the name change in their election campaigns (in 2016),"" he said. 
The procedure to pass constitutional changes is lengthy and requires several rounds of voting, with the Monday's debate being the first stage. If Zaev's coalition secures a two-thirds majority for the changes, the procedure could be completed in mid-January. 
Under the deal, Skopje would formally adopt the name of Republic of North Macedonia, replacing Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to join NATO and start the EU accession process.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and China launched a program on Monday to train Afghan diplomats and China's ambassador said it would likely be followed by joint programs in other fields to help war-torn Afghanistan.
Such cooperation is the first by the two Asian giants which have long been locked in a tussle for influence in a region stretching from Nepal to Sri Lanka and the island chain of the Maldives.
Within Afghanistan, India and the China have been on opposite sides with China relying on its old ally Pakistan as it seeks to stabilize Afghanistan by various means, including brokering talks to end the Taliban insurgency.
India, on the other hand, has invested billions of dollars in economic projects and training of military officers to strengthen the Afghan government in its fight against the Taliban. 
For its part, Pakistan sees the expansive diplomacy in Afghanistan by its old rival, India, as a way to encircle it.
China's ambassador to India said the joint training of 10 Afghan diplomats at the Indian Foreign Service Institute was the first step in China-India-Afghanistan cooperation that was agreed at a summit between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year. 
""This is just the beginning. China and India have respective advantages. For example, India has remarkable edge in agriculture and medical services, and China in hybrid rice and poverty reduction,"" the ambassador, Luo Zhaohui, said in a speech. 
""I am sure that in the future days China-India cooperation in Afghanistan will span from training program to more concrete projects.""
Modi and Xi agreed to handle long-standing political differences peacefully at their summit in China, just months after a dispute over a stretch of their Himalayan border near the tiny state of Bhutan rekindled fears of war. 
Luo said India-China cooperation in Afghanistan should be extended to countries such as Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Myanmar and even Iran. 
In many of these countries, China is helping to build infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which India sees as a bid by China to expand its influence.
China's call for partnership comes just a week after its embassy in New Delhi said India and China must deepen their cooperation to fight trade protectionism, as it criticized the United States for what it termed provoking disputes.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","A year after blogger's murder, many questions unanswered on Malta","By Stephen Grey and Chris Scicluna
VALLETTA (Reuters) - A year since its most prominent journalist was murdered, the tiny state of Malta has still not solved the mystery behind her death, or overcome the bitter division left by her legacy.
Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, who penned an anti-corruption blog, was killed on Oct. 16 2017 when a bomb placed inside her car blew up as she left her home in the peaceful hamlet of Bidnija, near the capital Valletta.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia's writings, offered a million euro ($1.2 million) reward for information leading to the arrest of the culprits, and called in the American FBI and Europol to assist the Maltese police.
But despite the fact three suspects were arrested in December and subsequently charged with killing the journalist, police are convinced that some as-yet-unidentified person gave the order to carry out the attack.
Malta is equally stymied on how to remember Caruana Galizia.
Some on the island, typically supporters of the ruling Labour Party, cannot forgive what they regard as a tilted campaign that she ran on her blog against figures often close to their camp. 
For others, many of them supporters of the rival Nationalist Party, she was a martyr. They are determined to preserve both her memory and to continue her fight against corruption.
A group set up soon after the murder, called Occupy Justice, holds vigils at a makeshift memorial opposite the Valletta law courts, but government workers regularly sweep the site clean of candles and flowers, looking to prevent a shrine taking root.
The three murder suspects were arrested on the strength of mobile phone records, that allegedly tied them to watching the journalist's home and detonating the bomb, police say. The trio have all denied the charges and no date has yet been set for their trial.
LOOKING FOR MOTIVES
The three men were never mentioned in any of Caruana Galizia's blogs and police critics say not enough is being done to uncover the mastermind.
Ana Gomes, a member of the European Parliament from Portugal who has led official delegations to Malta to investigate rule of law on the island, wrote on Twitter this month that the probe into who ordered the killing was stalled.
Malta Police have declined multiple requests for on-the-record interviews about the case. But sources briefed about the investigation confirm that over the last year nobody Caruana Galizia publicly wrote about had been questioned.
One senior officer, speaking off the record, dismissed the criticism, saying Caruana Galizia had made too many enemies to make any mass questioning of her foes worthwhile. 
""To establish the motive, the question is what she was planning to write and whose interest was she threatening,"" the officer said.
A team of about 10 police and Malta Security Service officers, who handle wire taps, continue to work the case.
The shock of Caruana Galizia's murder and the increased focus in Malta and abroad on corruption claims have done little to dent the Labour government's popularity or the local economy.
Polls published in the MaltaToday newspaper show the Labour Party and Muscat enjoying their highest-ever ratings while the Maltese economy is the best performer in the European Union.
A group of local and international media groups, including Reuters, began following up stories covered by Caruana Galizia in the wake of her death, in an initiative called the Daphne Project.

PARIS (Reuters) - France seized part of a severance payment to the former co-chairman of LafargeHolcim as part of an investigation into whether the cement maker paid off Islamic State and other militants in Syria, said a source close to the case.
Bruno Lafont received an 8 million euro package in 2015 when leaving Lafarge after the company was taken over by Swiss rival  Holcim  (SIX:LHN), the source said on Monday. He remained co-chairman of the merged company until 2017 when he retired.
Investigative magistrates seized about 2.475 million euros over the summer, according to public radio station France Inter.
Authorities are investigating how, before the takeover, Lafarge kept its plant in the city of Jalabiya in northern Syria running when the area was controlled by Islamic State. The group has since lost the cities and towns it held in Syria and Iraq.
Prosecutors opened an investigation into suspected funding of terrorism in June 2017. They are looking into payments possibly made by Lafarge through intermediaries to armed groups, including Islamic State, and into possible purchases of raw materials from intermediaries related to these groups.
Prosecutors estimate Lafarge may have paid about 13 million euros to militant groups.
A spokesman for LafargeHolcim and a lawyer for Lafont did not return calls seeking comment.
The case prompted Eric Olsen, the first CEO after the merger, to step down and it remains a headache for LafargeHolcim, which has struggled to make the merger work and is cutting costs under the leadership of a new chief executive.
Non-profit organization Sherpa brought the case to French tribunals on behalf of 14 former Syrian employees at Lafarge.
""The victims will be reassured they would get reparation at the end of the process,"" a Sherpa representative told Reuters.
Seven former Lafarge executives aside from Lafont are under formal investigation including Olsen. He has denied wrongdoing.
Prosecutors also seized funds from two former managers in Jalabiya, Bruno Pescheux et Frederic Jolibois, as well as the former deputy general operating manager Christian Herrault.
The total amount seized is equivalent to 3.7 million euros, according to France Inter.
""This is appalling. It is a violation of presumption of innocence. It is inadmissible,"" Herrault's lawyer Solange Doumic told Reuters. She said all four had appealed the decision.
Jolibois's lawyer confirmed that funds were seized from him. It was not immediately possible to reach a lawyer for Pescheux.
Magistrates did not seize funds from the four others it is investigating.
French authorities are also investigating Lafarge for financing terrorism and complicity to crime against humanity.

Sherpa said it hoped the investigation on crime against humanity will be extended to the company executives.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A year after their father was among nearly 600 Somalis killed in a fireball, the 32 children of Abdullah Mohamud plunged into poverty by his death are among the thousands still suffering the aftershocks what may be history's deadliest suicide bombing.
A bomb-laden truck heading for a base of African troops exploded instead in the center of the Somali capital Mogadishu on Oct 14, 2017. The blast took place next to a fuel truck, creating a storm of flame that incinerated victims. Two other car bombs also detonated in the city.
The attack was far and away the deadliest to hit the country, which has experienced a quarter century of civil war, clan conflict and Islamist violence. Even many of those far from the epicenter of the explosion are still reeling from the effects.
""We are suffering a lot and we cannot cope, because we all depended on him,"" said Nadifo Ahmed, one of the four wives who had depended for support on Mohamud, a livestock trader, who was killed in the blast.
With no breadwinner, the 32 children are effectively outcasts. They cannot afford school. They live in corrugated metal shacks, with no money for rent or medicine, she explained, seated on a mat under a tree, some of the children sitting quietly by her feet.
""Sometimes a relative may send me a small amount but it cannot fill the gap.... These are the burdens we are facing, and there is no one to help these families."" 
The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts. On Sunday, the anniversary of the explosion, the government executed a militant found guilty by a military court of participating in the attack plot.
Hundreds of residents wearing white and red headbands gathered at the site of the blast to commemorate the first anniversary of the attack and remember the dead. The headbands have become a symbol of public fury over the attacks and anger at the Islamist fighters blamed for them.
Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire unveiled a memorial to mark the attack at the site where bombed out buildings have since been rebuilt, one hosting a supermarket and a bank.
But survivors like Ali Mohamed have yet to rebuild their lives. Mohamed's wife was killed in the explosion. He suffered severe burns across his head and body that shriveled one ear and deformed his hands. He was unable to work for six months and still panics when he hears loud noises.
""I cannot bear any kind of sounds, like the running of a car engine, or gun shots and so on. I cannot sleep unless I use sleeping pills and sometimes I stay up till morning.""
Abdulqadir Abdirahman, director of the city's sole rescue service Amin Ambulance, had seen innumerable attacks over a 12-year career, but nothing prepared him for the devastation of that day.

""I saw what other people did not see,"" he recalled. ""A lot of people were bleeding and crying. A lot of cars were burning and buildings collapsing. I saw so many other things which I cannot ever forget.""

PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will travel to Florida's storm-ravaged Panhandle on Monday, the White House announced, in the president's first tour of the destruction left by the deadly Hurricane Michael.
It was previously announced that Trump would also inspect south Georgia, also battered by the storm that came ashore on Florida's Gulf Coast last week before it moved up the U.S. East Coast.
With 155 mph (250 kph) winds, Michael hit land on Oct. 10 as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, one of the most powerful storms to make landfall in the continental United States since records have been kept.
The president's exact itinerary was not released late on Sunday but he and the first lady are scheduled to arrive at Elgin Air Force Base in the Panhandle about 11:30 a.m. local time on Monday and are not scheduled to return to the White House until 8:30 p.m., the White House said.
At least 18 people in four states have died because of the storm. Dozens of people remained missing on Sunday in Florida Panhandle communities reduced to ruins.
Rescuers said they expected the death toll to rise and they were using cadaver dogs and heavy equipment to search through collapsed homes in small towns such as Mexico Beach and Panama City for more victims.
Rescue efforts have been hampered by blocked roads and huge piles of rubble in many communities such as Mexico Beach, which took a direct hit from the massive storm that killed at least one person there.
""If we lose only one life, to me that's going to be a miracle,"" Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey told Florida media.
Cathey told ABC News that 46 people out of the town of some 1,000 residents remained missing or unaccounted for on Sunday. 
Survivors grappled with power outages and shortages of food and water amid the mazes of uprooted trees and debris.
Electricity and telephone service were being slowly restored but it could be weeks before power returns to the state's most damaged areas.
More than 1,700 search and rescue workers were deployed, Florida Governor Rick Scott's office said, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances.
In Panama City, one of the hardest-hit communities, Fire Chief Alex Baird said search and rescue teams were now in ""recovery mode"" after largely giving up hope of finding any more survivors.

Trump is fully committed to helping state and local agencies with the recovery, the White House said. It was announced late on Sunday that he declared a state of emergency in Georgia, freeing up federal resources for the state. A similar declaration had already been made for Florida.

The law, which follows a constitutional amendment approved in June that brands rough sleeping a crime, empowers police to order homeless people to move into shelters. If they disobey three times within a 90-day period, the police can detain them and destroy their personal belongings.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government has said the new law aims to provide proper living conditions for the homeless and has set aside money to help them.
But Gabor Ivanyi, who leads the group Oltalom (Shelter) which operates homeless shelters with 600 beds in Budapest, said the government had failed to conduct a proper dialogue with charity organizations before it passed the legislation.
""This law serves the aim of scaring the homeless to prompt them to flee (the streets),"" Ivanyi said. ""They are scared and don't know what to do now. We don't know what will happen tomorrow.""
Homeless people had all but disappeared on Monday morning from underpasses in central Budapest where there would normally be plenty.
The government says it has allocated about 9 billion forints ($32.17 million) to homeless care in its 2018 budget plus an additional 300 million forints to expand shelter capacities.
""We believe we need to give additional help and not additional rights to homeless people,"" Bence Retvari, state secretary, told reporters on Saturday according to a video posted on HirTv website.
Retvari said further help would be available from Monday, without elaborating.
On Sunday around 500 protesters demonstrated against the law outside the Hungarian parliament.
""I believe this is shameful... that they criminalize the impossible and helpless situation that these people are in,"" said Agnes Merenyi, one of the demonstrators.
An activist group called ""Varos Mindenkie"" (which means ""the city is for everyone"") said in a statement: ""(The constitutional amendment) allows the authorities to persecute the most helpless people with a wider range of police tools from Oct. 15.""
Last month the European Parliament voted to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in a move the Orban government said was an attempt to punish Budapest for its anti-migration stance.
Orban's Fidesz party won a third consecutive four-year term on a landslide in an election in April.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Five South Koreans and four Nepali guides on a Himalayan climbing expedition were flung to their deaths after a huge block of ice crashed over a cliff into a narrow mountain gorge, a helicopter rescue official said on Monday.
It was Nepal's worst such disaster since 2015, when 18 climbers were killed in an avalanche triggered by a massive earthquake at the base of Mount Everest.
The team attempting Mount Gurja, a 7,193 meter-high (23,600-foot) peak, was led by Kim Chang-ho, a veteran of the sport who had set speed records on 14 of the world's highest mountains.
The accident appeared to have happened on Thursday or Friday, said Suraj Paudyal, a rescue official with the private helicopter company that was involved in retrieving the bodies, which were scattered over a wide area in the mountains.
""Some bodies were by the side of a cliff, while others lay in the ravine,"" said Paudyal, one of the first to arrive at the site, adding that it was reached only by dropping a 100-metre (330-foot) -long line (rope) and harnesses from the helicopter.
""A massive block of ice (serac), probably 100 metres (330 ft) tall, likely fell from the mountain along a gorge, sending strong winds that hit the camp, threw the climbers off a cliff edge and into a ravine,"" Paudyal told Reuters on Monday.
He did not elaborate on how he had been able to reconstruct the sequence of events.
Nepali authorities said they had no details of the incident, which happened in a remote area.
Nepal is arranging to send home the bodies of the South Koreans after post-mortems, said Surendra Thapa, a tourism ministry official.
The South Korean embassy in Kathmandu, the Nepali capital, had no comment.
Villagers had spotted the bodies on the mountain slopes on Saturday, but bad weather prevented emergency workers from retrieving them.
On Monday, rescuers brought eight of the retrieved bodies to Kathmandu, leaving one behind in his western home district of Myagdi, the site of the disaster. 
In 2013, the expedition's leader, Chang-ho, set a record as the fastest climber to reach the peaks of the world’s 14 tallest mountains without using supplemental oxygen, mountaineering officials say, in ascents made since 2005.

Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, and the autumn climbing season is now at its height. Gurja, which the expedition was trying to scale, is one of its less frequently climbed peaks.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A civil engineer from East Jerusalem is bucking a Palestinian boycott of Israeli politics by running for a seat in city hall with a campaign that demands equitable municipal services while side-stepping the long struggle over sovereignty. 
A third of Jerusalem residents are Palestinians, in areas Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed as its capital, a move not recognized abroad. They pay taxes and complain of neglect by Israeli authorities more attentive to western, Jewish districts.
The estrangement has been reinforced by a policy of non-participation in Jerusalem municipal politics ordered by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in the adjacent Israeli-occupied West Bank and wants East Jerusalem as capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. 
Ramadan Dabash, 51, is as old as Israel's rule and, having witnessed diplomatic deadlocks - the last round of statehood negotiations collapsed in 2014 - and spates of violence, is impatient for change. He talks in terms of pragmatic adaptation.
""East Jerusalemites suffer greatly from lack of services and representation in the municipality of Jerusalem,"" Dabash told Reuters in his district of Sur Baher, where unkempt streets and open piles of refuse are common sights. 
""Some of the people claim this is 'normalization' or 'Israelisation', but that is not true,"" said Dabash, a political independent whose campaign has been condemned by the PA.
""Receiving services is not considered normalization. It is a continuity of the normal daily life we are living - we do not have any other alternative ... Rights are taken, not granted.""
Dabash has pointedly eschewed a run for mayor in the Oct. 30 municipal election - a feted Israeli public office that four Jewish candidates, one of them a cabinet ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are closely contesting.
Another Palestinian, Aziz Abu Sarah, announced a mayoral campaign but quickly abandoned it last month after Arabic-shouting protesters pelted him with eggs outside city hall.
Dabash hopes to win as many as five seats on the 31-member city council. His ""Jerusalem is My City"" list has 13 Palestinian candidates as well as a Jewish Israeli adviser.
Success looks unlikely. A candidate needs 8,000 votes to become a council member. Municipal data show that the turnout in the last two elections among Jerusalem's voting-age Palestinians - who number around 220,000 - has hovered around 3 percent, suggesting deep grassroots disaffection with Jerusalem politics.
Palestinian leaders strongly disapprove of Dabash's bid.

""These attempts have failed before, and will also fail this time, because our people in the city of Jerusalem will reject these outcasts who try to legitimize this occupation and the tools of this occupation,"" said Adnan Ghaith, the PA official in charge of the Jerusalem file.

Belgium will hold federal and regional elections on May 26, the same day as elections held across the European Union for seats in the European Parliament.
In Sunday's regional elections, Michel's Mouvement Reformateur (MR) slipped by around 4 percentage points in all but one of the provinces in Wallonia, the French-speaking southern region of Belgium, and lost a number of mayoral posts in the capital Brussels.
Michel told broadcaster RTBF that his party had done better than forecast by opinion polls.
""We are relatively stable,"" he said.
In the Dutch-speaking north of the country, Flanders, the three parties ruling at national level had mixed results. Bart De Wever, the leader of the separatist N-VA, was on course to stay on as mayor of Belgium's second city, Antwerp.
Federal governments in Belgium result from separate elections in Flanders and Wallonia. Michel's government, in power since 2014, is unusual in that it contains only one French-speaking party and lacks a majority in the south of the country.

The local election's big winners, north and south, were the Greens, with gains also registered by the hard left PTB in Wallonia and the separatist anti-immigrant Vlaams Belang in Flanders.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A European Union sanctions plan to punish computer hackers is not directed at Russia or any one single country, Lithuania's foreign minister said on Monday, as Italy came under pressure from a group of EU members states to back the proposal.
Seven EU countries including Britain, the Netherlands and Lithuania are pushing for the EU to be able to impose sanctions more quickly on specific individuals anywhere in the world, freezing their assets in the bloc and banning them from entry, according to an EU document obtained by Reuters.
Russia has made cyber and electronic warfare a key part of its military operations, Western officials say, and Britain, the Netherlands and the United States have accused Moscow of conducting a global campaign of computer hacks against the West.
But Rome, where the anti-establishment government wants to have better ties with Russia, fears the sanctions would alienate Moscow and it opposes the EU plan, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.
""We would not target a single geography. This is not against Russia by default,"" Lithuania's Linas Linkevicius told Reuters before a meeting with other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. 
""If Russia attacks us, we will target Russia. If someone else attacks us, then we will target them,"" he said.
Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's co-ruling far-right League, has expressed his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western elections.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure his Italian counterpart Enzo Moavero Milanesi on Monday that the proposal, which London hopes to have agreed before it leaves the EU next March, is not against Russia, diplomats said. 
Belgium, Sweden and Poland are also broadly in favor but want more discussion, a second internal document showed. EU diplomats hope EU leaders could back the sanctions plan in their final statement at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
""It is only a matter of time before we are hit by a critical operation with severe consequences on the EU and member states,"" the three-page proposal document said, urging action on cyber defenses which have been under discussion since 2015.
""We need to be ready to respond,"" it said.
EU and NATO diplomats believe China and North Korea, as well as Russia, have developed sophisticated computer hacking weapons and cybersurveillance software to spy on and undermine the West, often using criminal groups to mask the origin of such attacks.
The EU cyber regime plan follows a similar sanctions mechanism formally agreed by ministers on Monday to punish chemical weapons' attacks by targeting people blamed for using banned munitions regardless of their nationality.

Yang apologized last week in a Weibo post, vowing to stop live streaming, to conduct ""self-rectification"" and ""seriously watch patriotic publicity films"".
The national anthem law also covers the territories of Hong Kong and Macau.

Harry, 34, younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, married the U.S. television star Meghan Markle in May at a ceremony that mixed traditional British pomp with a gospel choir and other nods to her American heritage.
British media said Meghan, 37, was believed to be about 12 weeks pregnant. The baby will be seventh-in-line to the British throne.
""Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public,"" the couple's Kensington Palace office said in a statement. 
The news emerged shortly after the royal couple landed in Australia for their first overseas tour, a busy trip which will also take in New Zealand and the South Pacific islands of Tonga and Fiji.
British media said Harry and Meghan broke the news of their pregnancy to the royal family on Friday, when they attended the wedding of Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie at Windsor Castle, where Harry and Meghan themselves were married five months ago.
There had been media speculation for a number of weeks that Meghan might be pregnant, and the couple had made no secret of their desire to have children.
""Hopefully we'll start a family in the near future,"" Harry had said in a TV interview when they announced their engagement in November last year.
The child will not be a prince or a princess unless the queen authorizes such a title before the birth. Instead, royal experts said if a boy, the child would officially be styled the Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harry's subsidiary titles - and Lady Windsor if a girl.
""My warmest congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the happy news they are expecting a baby in the Spring,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter. ""Wishing them all the best."" 
After their arrival in Australia on Monday, Meghan and Harry were escorted by a motorcade to the residence of Australia's Governor-General on Sydney's north shore. 
Braving rain, well-wishers lined the streets to Admiralty House where the pair were later spotted by local press enjoying a walk, hand in hand, through the grounds as they recovered from the long plane journey.

Their official duties will begin on Tuesday with a ferry trip across Sydney Harbor and past the Opera House, a visit to Taronga Zoo to see koalas and a viewing of a contemporary indigenous dance troupe.

The penguins, Magic and Sphen, formed a bond ahead of the 2018 breeding season, before starting to collect the pebbles, state-backed broadcaster ABC said. 
Sea Life staff then gave the pair a dummy egg, and after having shown strong nurturing skills the pair of Gentoo penguins were given a real one to look after, it said in a report. 
""We'd go over there and Magic and Sphen would be bowing to each other,"" Tish Hannan, supervisor of the aquarium's penguin department told the broadcaster.
Upon receiving the dummy egg, she added, ""They immediately knew exactly what it was and started incubating it.""
Gentoo penguins share parenting and feeding responsibilities equally, so there is little difference between opposite-sex or same-sex parenting, Hannan said, and the example is not the first among zoos around the world. 
Sea Life aquarium did not respond to an email request for comment made outside business hours. 
A children's book, ""And Tango Makes Three"", based on the real story of two penguins at New York's Central Park Zoo who reared their own chick, drew acclaim from some for depicting non-traditional family structures. 

It was also among some titles pulled from bookshelves in public libraries in Hong Kong this year after pressure from anti-gay groups, the South China Morning Post newspaper has said.

Salvini -- who is also head of the far-right ruling League party -- said that many business leaders had asked him when the sanctions would be over, noting that Italian companies had been hit by the measure. 
In June, European Union leaders agreed to extend their economic sanctions against Russia, prolonging curbs on doing business with the Russian banking, financial and energy sectors until the end of January.

Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said it was up to Russia now to judge whether the deal to prevent a Syrian government offensive on Syria's rebel-held Idlib had been fulfilled.
""We cannot keep quiet about the continuation of the current situation in Idlib if the Nusra Front refuses to comply with this agreement,"" al-Moualem said at a press conference with his Iraqi counterpart Ibrahim al-Jaafari in Damascus.
The deal sets up a demilitarized zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) deep into rebel territory that must be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadist groups by Monday. 
""Now we must give the time to our friends the Russians to judge whether the agreement was fulfilled or not,"" he said, adding that Turkey has the means to ensure the deal is complied with.

""For us we said always Idlib, as any other province, has to return back to Syrian sovereignty. We prefer to have it through peaceful means, through reconciliation, but if not there (are) other options,"" Moualem said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A researcher for Amnesty International has described how he was abducted in southern Russia by men who drove him to a field where they held a gun to his head, made him take off his clothes, beat him, and tried to blackmail him. 
Speaking after his release, Oleg Kozlovsky, 34, said he was abducted on Oct. 6 in Ingushetia, a majority-Muslim region around 1,500 km south of Moscow, currently in the grip of public protests over a land swap deal with neighboring Chechnya.
Kozlovsky said his abductors wore dark baseball caps and medical masks and did not identify themselves.
""One of these people put my head down, took out a gun and put it to the back of my head and said he would shoot me,"" Kozlovsky told Reuters, saying the men had tried to blackmail him into working as an informer for police tasked with tackling cases of extremism, an offer he refused. 
Reuters interviewed Kozlovsky on Thursday, but held his story until Monday to allow him and his family to take security measures. 
Kozlovsky filed a statement to Russia's Investigative Committee on Oct. 9, but had not received a response by Monday.
The Investigative Committee and local branches of the Federal Security Service and Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Kozlovsky went to Ingushetia on Oct. 5 to research freedom of assembly in the context of the land swap protests rocking Ingushetia. On the evening of Oct. 6, he said a man knocked on the door of his hotel room in the regional capital Magas and told him a protest leader wanted to speak to him. 
He said he was then led to a car and once inside joined by two men who took his phone and started hitting him and asking him who he was and what he was doing.
He was later let out in a field and told to lie down with his hands behind his back and told he would be shot if he tried to run. An object was pressed against his hands, causing him to suspect they might try to frame him for drug or weapons possession, he said.
The men then made him strip, photographed him, and threatened to publish the photos unless he agreed to work for anti-extremism police. After he refused, they tried to ensure he'd stay silent, he said. 
""They again put me on the ground, again put the gun to the back of my head, and told me to pray. And then they told me that if I tell anyone about all this, they'll kill my children,"" he said. He said he agreed to keep quiet. 
They then returned his possessions, except his phone and camera and drove him, via his hotel, to an airport complaining about how hard it was to tackle extremism. He flew back to Moscow the next day with a fractured rib. 
""I am sure that if they want to, Russian authorities could find them,"" he said of his abductors. ""Of course I don't know if there is such a desire.""

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 05:08AM ET</span>",Jordan and Syria reopen Nassib border crossing,"JABER, Jordan (Reuters) - The border crossing between Jordan and Syria officially opened to civilians and trade on Monday after being closed for three years. 
The Nassib crossing opened an 8 a.m. (0500 GMT), a border official at the Jaber checkpoint on the Jordanian side told a Reuters reporter. By 11:15 a.m., the reporter had seen no traffic at the border other than one Syrian businessman and a group of Jordanian traders who crossed to the Syrian side. 
Jordanian state news agency Petra reported early on Monday that Jordan and Syria had agreed to open the border to all in a change from an earlier statement that normal traffic would not be allowed until a later date.
""We are fully ready to receive passengers and transport of goods,"" Imad Riyalat, head of the Jaber crossing, told Reuters. ""We expect the traffic to be slow now at the start, but in coming days we expect passenger movement to pick up."" 
The Syrian government retook the area around the Nassib border crossing with Jordan in July during a Russian-backed offensive to drive rebels from their stronghold in southwest Syria. The civil war in Syria began more than seven years ago. 
The closure of the Nassib crossing in 2015 cut a crucial transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Turkey and the Gulf, and Lebanon and the Gulf, in multi-billion dollar annual trade. 
Since then, Syria's only normally operating frontier crossing has been with Lebanon, which itself has no other functioning land borders.
Opening the border will also be important for Lebanon, which relies on Syria for overland connections to all other countries because its only other frontier is with Israel, with which it has no ties.
Syrian state television footage showed the Syrian side of the crossing as being virtually empty, with just a couple of vehicles present. State news agency SANA said the logistical arrangements for opening the crossing had been completed.
""A Jordanian citizen may leave for Syria in their own car or as a regular passenger. Jordanian cargo is also allowed to leave for Syria according to the Jordanian-Syrian agreement,"" Petra said on Monday. 

Petra said Syrians entering Jordan must first obtain security clearance from Jordanian authorities, as has been the case throughout the Syria's war.

Six helicopters were scrambled to help rescue people from the roofs of their homes, but bad weather was making operations difficult, the prefect of Aude, Alain Thirion, told BFM TV. Around 250 firemen and 100 police were involved in the effort.
""We have people stranded on rooftops. We're going to have to use aircraft to evacuate them because we cannot reach them by boat given the force of the water. It's too dangerous,"" he said.
Among the worst hit areas were the villages of Conques-sur-Orbiel and Villardonnel, where waters rose as high as the first-floor windows of some houses. The Aude region is best known for its Medieval fort city of Carcassonne.
The flash floods struck without warning. At least one victim was swept away by raging waters while sleeping, Thirion said. Television pictures showed rivers flowing furiously, having torn down trees and concrete power pylons, and swept away cars.
Water levels were expected to continue to rise in the area on Monday, with rain forecast until late in the morning. Schools in the area were closed and residents were told to stay at home.
Torrential rains are not uncommon in France at this time of year, but meteorologists have said exceptionally warm sea water along the Mediterranean coast may be intensifying the rains. 
The year so far is France's hottest since 1900, according to the state meteorological service.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The wife of a Pakistani politician killed in a Taliban suicide attack during campaigning won her husband's provincial seat in by-elections as the ruling party of new Prime Minister Imran Khan retained its slim majority in parliament.
Samar Bilour on Sunday won the provincial assembly seat in northwestern Khyber Pakthunkhwa province that her husband Haroon Bilour, a member of the anti-Taliban Awani National Party, had been scheduled to contest in July.
Haroon Bilour was killed along with 19 others in a suicide attack in Peshawar, the provincial capital, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban weeks before the July 25 polls. The attack prompted a delay in voting for that seat.
His father, senior ANP leader Bashir Bilour, was killed in a suicide bombing in the run-up to Pakistan's last election in 2013.
Sunday's by-elections were for 24 seats across the four provincial assemblies and 11 in the National Assembly. Most of the national parliamentary seats were open because Pakistan allows a candidate to run in multiple constituencies but only keep one seat.
The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) won four out of 11 parliamentary seats contested, retaining its slim majority in the National Assembly.
After Sunday's vote, the PTI and its coalition partners held a slim three-seat majority of 174 seats in the 342-seat parliament. Khan's ruling coalition in parliament elected him prime minister by 176 votes in August.
But the PTI lost two of the four constituencies originally won by Khan, while former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) made marginal gains by adding four seats.
The PML-N's Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who served as prime minister after Sharif was removed from office by the Supreme Court last year, was among those elected to parliament after missing out in the July elections.
Sharif, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison by an accountability court weeks before the July polls, said the run-up to the elections had been influenced by the military influencing the courts to bar a number of PML-N legislators.
The army and judiciary vehemently deny any interference in civilian politics.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2018 02:43AM ET</span>","Taiwan invites Pope Francis to visit, following landmark China-Vatican pact","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has invited Pope Francis to visit, its President Tsai Ing-wen said, just weeks after the Vatican reached a milestone deal on the appointment of bishops with China, which claims the self-ruled island as its own. 
Last month's deal gives the Holy See, Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic ally in Europe, a long-sought say over such appointments, although both sides call it ""provisional"" and sources have said some key issues remain unresolved.
Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen met Francis on Sunday and invited him to visit, Tsai's office said in a statement, adding that the pope had replied he would pray for Taiwan. But it gave no date for the proposed visit. 
Chen emphasized the provisional nature of the agreement between the Vatican and China, saying it did not involve a ""diplomatic element"" or affect the friendship between Taiwan and the Vatican, the statement added.
""We urge everyone not to excessively interpret and worry about this (deal),"" it quoted Chen as saying.
On social media, Tsai thanked the pope for his blessings. ""We will take active and concrete actions to support the pope and to transmit our common values of freedom, justice, peace and care to all corners of the world,"" she wrote.
Although the Vatican says its Sept. 22 deal is not political, some Taiwan officials worry it could be a prelude to establishing diplomatic ties with Beijing, and Taiwan's Vatican envoy has said China wants to make the island irrelevant. 
Taipei has routinely accused China, which considers it a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to return it to the fold, of using dollar diplomacy and bullying to lure away its allies, charges Beijing has denied.
This year, former allies El Salvador, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic switched ties to Beijing from Taipei, leaving it with just 17 formal allies, mostly less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.
On Oct. 1, in the first sign of a thaw after the pact, which was more than 10 years in the making, the Vatican said Beijing would, for the first time, allow Chinese bishops to attend a major Vatican meeting.
The meeting, known as a synod, began on Oct. 3 and runs until Oct. 28.
However, Michael Yeung, the bishop of Hong Kong, told Reuters it will take time to tackle issues beyond the appointment of bishops and he feared suppression of Catholics in mainland China would continue despite the accord.
About a dozen bishops and priests, some elderly, remain in detention in China. Some have not been heard from in decades. Beijing has provided little clear information about their fate.

Reuters, citing the men's lawyer, reported last week that Malaysia had released the 11 from detention and sent them to Turkey, disregarding China's request to hand them to Beijing.
""They have done nothing wrong in this country, so they are released,"" Mahathir said in brief comments to reporters in parliament, the first from the Malaysian government since their release.
Malaysia's move was likely to strain ties with China, which have already been tested since Mahathir won a stunning election victory in May and canceled more than $20 billion worth of projects awarded to Chinese companies.
China, which had asked for their extradition, said on Friday that it ""resolutely"" opposed Malaysia's decision to release the 11 Uighurs and send them to Turkey.
Prosecutors in Muslim-majority Malaysia dropped charges against the Uighurs on humanitarian grounds, their lawyer said.
The men were detained and charged with illegally entering Malaysia after November's daring prison break, during which they punched holes in a prison wall and used blankets as ladders.
Reuters reported in February that Malaysia was under great pressure from China to send the men there. Some Western missions sought to dissuade Kuala Lumpur from sending them to China, which has been accused of persecuting Uighurs.
Beijing accuses separatist extremists among the Uighur minority of plotting attacks on China's Han majority in the restive far western region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
China has been accused of rights abuses in Xinjiang, torture of Uighur detainees and tight controls on their religion and culture. It denies wrongdoing.

Over the years, hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs have escaped the unrest by traveling clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey.

The migrants, who included families of adults and children, and women carrying babies, began a march on Saturday from the violent northern city of San Pedro Sula, days after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called on Central America to stop mass migration.
The U.S. Embassy in Honduras said it was deeply worried about the group and that people were being given ""false promises"" of being able to enter the United States. The embassy said the situation in Honduras was improving.
Honduras' government echoed part of that language, saying it regretted the situation and that citizens were being ""deceived."" 
Mexico's government issued a statement on Saturday reminding foreign nationals that visas should be requested in consulates, not at the border, and said migration rules were ""always observed.""
March organizer Bartolo Fuentes told Reuters that participants were not being offered or promised anything but were fleeing poverty and violence back home.
Fuentes, a former Honduran lawmaker, said the group had grown on its journey to some 1,800 migrants from 1,300.
The so-called migrant caravan, in which people move in groups either on foot or by vehicle, grew in part because of social media.
The group began to arrive in Nueva Ocotepeque, near the Guatemalan border, on Sunday. The plan is to cross Guatemala and reach Tapachula in southern Mexico to apply for humanitarian visas that allow people to cross the country or get asylum, Fuentes said.
Honduras, where some 64 percent of households are in poverty, is afflicted by gangs that violently extort people and businesses.

Last week, Pence told Central American countries that the United States was willing to help with economic development and investment if they did more to tackle mass migration, corruption and gang violence.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",Opinion poll shows some voters warming to Australia's new prime minister,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's new prime minister extended his party's nascent recovery, one widely watched opinion poll showed on Monday, six days before a crucial by-election, but the main Labor opposition still holds a landslide-sized lead before elections due by May.
The Newspoll, published in The Australian newspaper, showed the ruling Liberal-National coalition trailing Labor 47 percent to 53 percent on a two-party preferred basis, under which votes for minor parties are redistributed according to Australia's preferential voting system.
The gap between the two main parties, twice as wide a month ago, tightened by two points since the previous poll.
However, another poll in The Sydney Morning Herald showed the gap between the government and Labor widening significantly. The Herald's Fairfax-Ipsos poll, based on a smaller sample than the Newspoll, showed Labor leading 55-45, an increase of four points since September. 
Both polls suggest a resounding defeat for the government at a general election, which must be held by May.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Scott Morrison did perform better with voters than Malcolm Turnbull, the man he replaced in a party-room coup in August, on a range of Newspoll personal measures including ""capable of handling the economy"".
Morrison is also seen as more capable of delivering tax cuts, a key policy battleground where he burnished his credentials last week with a promise to reduce taxes on small businesses.
""He's doing better than Turnbull. That's not what you would have expected three months ago,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia state.
""He seems to have a way with words, or more in common with the average Australian, especially where it counts in the marginal, outer-urban electorates,"" he said.
However, Morrison faces a by-election on Saturday in Turnbull's harbourside Sydney seat, where voter anger over the revolving door of political leaders has made a once-safe Liberal district a close contest.
The stakes are even higher because the center-right coalition clings to power by a one-seat margin in parliament, which means a loss at the by-election would force Morrison to strike an agreement with independent lawmakers to continue in minority government.
By-elections typically produce strong swings against sitting governments, with the affluent seat of Wentworth seen as particularly vulnerable because of Turnbull's personal popularity.

The strongest challenger in the seat, polls suggest, is popular independent Kerryn Phelps, who has promised to allow Morrison to continue in minority government.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 07:48PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia says will retaliate against any sanctions over Khashoggi case,"By Andrew Torchia and Arshad Mohammed
DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Sunday warned against threats to punish it over last week's disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as European leaders piled on pressure and two more U.S. executives scrapped plans to attend a Saudi investor conference.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh's policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, though he said Washington would be ""punishing"" itself if it halted military sales to Riyadh.
""The Kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating false accusations,"" the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted an unnamed official as saying.
""The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and that the Kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy,"" the official added, without elaborating.
The Saudi Embassy in Washington later tweeted what it called a clarification, thanking countries including the United States ""for refraining from jumping to conclusions"" over the case.
In a sign Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud may seek a diplomatic solution to the incident, he stressed the strength of Saudi-Turkish ties in a telephone call with President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, the Saudi press agency said late on Sunday.
The king thanked Erdogan for welcoming a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to discuss Khashoggi's disappearance and said no one could undermine their relationship.
EUROPE SEEKS CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION
Europe's largest economies -- Britain, France and Germany -- said on Sunday they were treating the case with ""the utmost seriousness"".
""There needs to be a credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and - if relevant - to identify those bearing responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and ensure that they are held to account,"" the countries said in a joint statement.
""We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response. We have conveyed this message directly to the Saudi authorities."" 
The statement, by Britain's Jeremy Hunt, France's Jean-Yves Le Drian and Germany's Heiko Maas, made no mention of potential actions the countries might take. Hunt later said that if Saudi Arabia were proven to be guilty, ""we would have to think about the appropriate way to react in that situation.""
OIL PRICE WARNING
In a column published just after the SPA statement, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel's General Manager Turki Aldakhil warned that imposing sanctions on the world's largest oil exporter could spark global economic disaster.
""It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure to commit to producing 7.5 million barrels. If the price of oil reaching $80 angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure,"" he wrote.
Investor concern is growing that Khashoggi's disappearance could add to a sense that Saudi policy has become more unpredictable under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing social and economic reforms but has also presided over a rise in tensions between with several countries.
A Gulf banker said the Khashoggi case, combined with other events, had become a significant factor for some potential investors.
""It's cumulative – the Yemen war, the dispute with Qatar, the tensions with Canada and Germany, the arrests of women activists. They add up to an impression of impulsive policy-making, and that worries investors,"" the banker said.
Foreign capital is key to Saudi plans for economic diversification and job creation. 
But in response to Khashoggi's disappearance, media organizations and a growing number of executives have pulled out of a Riyadh investment conference scheduled for next week, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert.""
On Sunday,  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co said Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has canceled plans to attend the Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Chairman Bill Ford has canceled his trip to the Middle East, which included an appearance at the Saudi investment conference. 
JP Morgan Chase and Ford did not comment on whether the decision was related to concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin still plans to attend the conference, but that could change, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on ABC's ""This Week"".
WASHINGTON REACTS
U.S. senators called for reactions ranging from boycotting an upcoming economic summit in Riyadh to ending support for Saudi military operations in Yemen.
""If they lured this man into that consulate, they went medieval on him, and he was killed and he was chopped up and they sent a death crew down there to kill him and do all of this, that would be an outrage,"" Florida Senator Marco Rubio told CNN's State of the Union.
""Just because they are an ally in an important mission, which is containing Iranian expansion in the region, cannot allow us to overlook or walk away from that.""
Fellow Republican, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, appearing on ""This Week"", called for “severe action” which he said would affect arms sales and involvement in Yemen.
The Saudi stock market fell as much as 7 percent in early trade on Sunday, one of the first signs of economic pain Riyadh could suffer over the affair. By close, it had recovered some losses, ending down 3.5 percent and losing $16.5 billion of market value.
Senators have triggered a provision of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act requiring the president to determine whether a foreign person is responsible for a gross human rights violation. The act has in the past imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials.
Anti-Saudi sentiment in the U.S. Congress could conceivably raise pressure to pass the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, which would end sovereign immunity shielding OPEC members from U.S. legal action.
ACCESSING CONSULATE
The crisis has polarized Saudis, with some blaming the nation's enemies and others concerned about the direction the country is heading under Prince Mohammed.
Prince Khaled al-Faisal, a senior member of Saudi Arabia's ruling family and senior advisor to King Salman, has met Erdogan to discuss Khashoggi's disappearance, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters without providing details.
A Turkish official told Reuters on Sunday that the Saudis had said they would allow the consulate to be searched, and that this would happen by the end of the weekend, though he conceded to ""flexibility on this date.""

""But Turkey is determined on the subject of entering the consulate and carrying out a criminal inspection. There is no alternative to carrying out this inspection. Time is important in terms of evidence,"" the official said.

The move comes nearly six months after the Ecuadorean government suspended Assange's communications in March, after he discussed issues on social media that could damage the country's diplomatic relations, including a diplomatic crisis between London and Moscow as well as Catalonian separatism.
""Ecuador rolls back @JulianAssange isolation,"" WikiLeaks said in a message on Twitter. The change was also confirmed by Assange's Australian legal adviser, Greg Barns, who called it ""a welcome development.""
An Assange spokesman said his communications have been only partially restored. 
Assange took refuge in Ecuador's London Embassy after British courts ordered his extradition to Sweden to face questioning in a sexual molestation case. That case has since been dropped. But friends and supporters say Assange now fears he could be arrested and eventually extradited to the United States if he leaves the embassy. WikiLeaks, which published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets when Assange ran the operation, faces a U.S. grand jury investigation. 
""The main issue, the requirement for the UK to give an undertaking that Julian would not be extradited to the U.S., remains unresolved,"" Barns told Reuters.
Friends and supporters of Assange say he has had contact only with lawyers since Ecuador suspended his communications with the outside world. WikiLeaks recently announced that one of Assange's longtime associates, Kristin Hrafnsson, had taken over from him as WikiLeaks editor in chief. 
As a 2016 presidential candidate, President Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks for publishing hacked emails that embarrassed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. 

But Trump administration officials have condemned Assange, while a federal grand jury continues a long-running criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel, a U.S. official recently confirmed.

Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance spearheaded by al Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate previously known as the Nusra Front, said it had adopted its stance after taking time for ""consultation"".
Although it did not explicitly say it would abide by the deal, it said it would seek to provide security for people in the area it controls and that it appreciated efforts to protect that area, an apparent reference to Turkey. 
""We value the efforts of all those striving - at home and abroad - to protect the liberated area and prevent its invasion and the perpetration of massacres in it,"" Tahrir al-Sham said in its statement. 
""But we warn at the same time against the trickery of the Russian occupier or having faith in its intentions,"" it added. The group also said it ""would not forget"" the foreign fighters who came to assist it. 
Idlib's other main rebel faction, a Turkish-aligned alliance of groups known as the National Liberation Front, has already expressed its support for the agreement. 
The deal sets up a demilitarized zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) deep into rebel territory that must be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadist groups by Monday, Oct. 15. 
Turkey has been working to persuade Tahrir al-Sham to comply with the agreement, which it arranged with the Syrian government's main ally Russia to avert an assault that it feared would send a new wave of refugees toward its border. 
However, Tahrir al-Sham also said in its statement, issued via its social media channels, that it would not end its jihad or hand over its weapons. 
Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of rebels who rose against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. It is also home to an estimated 3 million people, more than half of whom have already been displaced at least once during the war. 
Last week Turkey said the demilitarized zone had been set up, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the zone was effective and no large scale military actions were planned in Idlib. 

Russian and Turkish troops will eventually patrol the zone, according to their agreement.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",Brexit talks stall before midweek EU summit,"By Gabriela Baczynska, Alastair Macdonald and Elizabeth Piper
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The stubborn problem of Britain's land border with Ireland thwarted a drive to clinch a Brexit deal before a European Union summit this week, as negotiators admitted defeat after marathon talks and pressed pause for the coming days.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after meeting British Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that they could still not bridge a gap between his ""backstop"" demands that Northern Ireland stay in the EU's economic zone if there is a risk that border checks with EU member Ireland could revive conflict, and London's rejection of any checks on trade between the province and the British mainland. 
Both sides want to end more than a year of talks by mid-November. This is to give parliaments in London and Brussels time to approve a deal before Britain otherwise crashes out of the EU next March, plunging businesses and millions of ordinary citizens into a chaotic and costly legal limbo. 
However, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces intense opposition to some of the EU's demands from members of her Conservative party and allies in Northern Ireland, some of whom threaten to reject any deal they do not like in parliament. 
""Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for (Ireland/Northern Ireland) to avoid a hard border,"" Barnier tweeted after his meeting in Brussels with Raab ended days of bargaining between Barnier's deputy Sabine Weyand and May's Brexit lieutenant Oliver Robbins.
A British government spokesman said progress had been made in some key areas. ""However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop. The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council,"" he said.
But the result, EU officials and diplomats said, is that there are no plans for further talks before leaders of the other 27 EU member states meet over dinner in Brussels on Wednesday to hear Barnier brief them on the state of play. 
Several said there was little chance the leaders would give Barnier new instructions. They noted this puts the onus on May, who will join the leaders on Thursday morning, to break the deadlock she faces among her own allies and supporters.
""It seems like May doesn't have backing in her cabinet for the backstop,"" said one senior EU diplomat who was briefed by Barnier.
Both sides had for a time been talking up progress but many Brussels diplomats and officials have questioned whether May could appear to come to terms quite so quickly. More days, or weeks, of drama could strengthen her hand as both sides talk up preparations for a possible ""no-deal"" Brexit.
Leaders had been due to decide on Wednesday whether enough progress had been made for them to agree to hold another summit, pencilled in for Nov. 17-18, at which both the treaty on an orderly British withdrawal and a vaguer document setting out future trade relations could be inked in.
It is unclear now whether the leaders will call for the November summit this week. Many, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, made clear at a summit with May last month that they would agree to meet only if she could show she had come sufficiently close to a deal to make it worthwhile.
EU sources said Barnier's team have offered new wording on a text on the backstop, highlighting that it may never be activated or only for a limited time, and also that Britain as a whole could stay under EU rules for longer as it transitions out after March 2019. But so far that has not met British reservations.
Both sides want to avoid renewed checks on what will become their only land border to avoid hindering trade on the island of Ireland and reawakening tensions two decades after a peace deal ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS 
David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July, accused May's government earlier on Sunday of accepting ""the EU's language on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet members to exert their collective authority,"" Davis, who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, wrote in the Sunday Times.
Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for goods. 
So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
Even if she reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority government to other legislation such as the budget.
""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.

""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules made in a place where we have no say.""

Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged at a landmark summit in Singapore in June to work toward denuclearization. But the agreement was short on specifics and talks have made little headway since, with the North refusing to declare its nuclear weapons and facilities or agree to a concrete timeline.
""This year I have discussed in depth with Kim for hours. These meetings have convinced me that he has taken the strategic decision to abandon his nuclear weapon,"" Moon told Le Figaro in an interview before a state visit to Paris. 
Moon is to meet President Emmanuel Macron on Monday.
While Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests this year, it failed to keep its promise to allow international inspections of its dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in May, stirring criticism that the move could be reversed.
But Moon said Kim was ""sincere, calm and polite"" and ""felt frustrated by the international community's continuing mistrust"".
""It is now time to respond to these efforts that were hard to agree to,"" Moon said. ""We need to assure Kim Jong Un that he took the right decision in deciding to denuclearize and we need to accompany him in his wish for a durable and solid peace."" 
Washington wants concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities, before meeting Pyongyang's demands, including an official end to the Korean war and the easing of international sanctions.
Moon said he hoped another Trump-Kim summit would allow the two leaders to go further than the statements they made at their first meeting in Singapore.
""Declaring an end to the Korea war would be a start to establishing a regime of peace,"" he said, also calling for the United States to take ""reliable corresponding measures to guarantee the security of the regime"". 

""We could also in the future discuss the easing of sanctions, in accordance with progress on denuclearization,"" he added.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police arrested 26 people on Sunday ahead of a planned march against the government of President Daniel Ortega, local human rights groups said.
Among those arrested ahead of the ""United for Liberty"" march were civil society activists and political leaders, according to a list published by Nicaragua human rights non-profit the Comision Permanente de Derechos Humanos.
The march was canceled after the arrests, its leaders said.
Protests first erupted in April when Ortega's leftist government moved to reduce welfare benefits, but have escalated into broader opposition against Ortega, who has been in office since 2007.
More than 300 people have been killed in the protests, according to local human rights groups. Ortega's government disputes those figures and says 198 people have died.
""Protesting is a right, repression is a crime, liberty for political prisoners,"" demonstrator Tamara Davila shouted on Sunday, moments before she was loaded into a police vehicle.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said on Twitter that it was deeply worried by the arrests, and called on the government to guarantee the security of the protesters.
On Saturday, Nicaraguan police said in a statement that the planned protest was illegal and that they would do everything necessary to stop it. Shortly after, President Ortega also criticized the protesters in a speech to supporters on Saturday. 
""They keep calling for marches not for peace, but for blood, that's what they want, they want blood,"" he said. 

From early on Sunday, police special forces and government supporters began to patrol the streets of the capital, Managua, according to a Reuters witness.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 02:32PM ET</span>",Jordan and Syria say border to reopen on Monday,"AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The border crossing between Jordan and Syria will officially reopen on Monday after being closed for three years, the two countries said on Sunday, though it will not be open to normal traffic immediately. 
Meanwhile, the Syrian and Iraqi foreign ministers discussed accelerating efforts to reopen the border between their countries, Syrian state media said.
The Syrian government retook the area around the border crossing with Jordan at Nassib in July during a weeks-long Russian-backed offensive to drive rebels from their stronghold in southwest Syria. 
The closure of the Nassib crossing in 2015 cut a crucial transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Turkey and the Gulf, and Lebanon and the Gulf, in multi-billion dollar annual trade. 
Since then, Syria's only normally operating frontier crossing has been with Lebanon, which itself has no other functioning land borders.
The frontier with Turkey is still closed into Syrian government-held areas, and open only into territory controlled by rebels. 
Near Syria's border with Iraq, a U.S. military base has closed the main Damascus-Baghdad highway, though there is a smaller crossing at Albu Kamal further east that is presently open only for government or military traffic.
INTERNAL TRAFFIC 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari arrived in Damascus on Sunday for a three-day visit. He and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem discussed ""speeding up"" the reopening of their border, the official Sana news agency reported. 
As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has taken more territory inside Syria, normal internal traffic has resumed between most big cities, easing the movement of goods and people and bringing an economic boost in government-held areas.
Technical teams from Syria and Jordan met on the Jordanian side on Sunday and agreed on the final arrangements to open the crossing from Oct. 15, said Jordanian government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat. 
However, although the crossing will be officially opened on Monday, it will not open to normal traffic just yet, said Nael Husami, head of the Amman chamber of industry. 
Syrian state television also cited Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar as saying the border crossing and roads leading to it were being renovated. 
Opening the border will also be important for Lebanon, which relies on Syria for overland connections to all other countries because its only other frontier is with Israel, with which it has no ties. 
In July Lebanese caretaker economy minister Raed Khoury said it was vital for Lebanese exporters to be able once again to send produce overland through Syria to the wider region. 
Lebanese exports fell by 35 percent after the Syrian conflict began, Khoury said.

The public opinion survey, published in local newspaper El Comercio, was taken on Oct. 10-12, after Vizcarra threatened to dissolve Congress unless it passed his proposals for fighting entrenched graft in one of Latin America's most stable economies. 
Congress, where the unpopular conservative party Popular Force has a majority, approved the legislation last week.
Vizcarra took office in March to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned in a graft scandal on the eve of his near-certain impeachment.
Little known in Peru when he was sworn in, Vizcarra has built support by responding to widespread anger at back-to-back graft scandals in Peru with a proposed overhaul of the country's judicial and political systems.

The Ipsos survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.77 percentage points.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A U.S. student barred from Israel under a law against pro-Palestinian boycotters filed an appeal on Sunday with its top court, which suspended her deportation pending a discussion of the case.
Lara Alqasem, 22, flew to Israel on Oct. 2 on a study visa but was refused entry by security officials who cited her role as president of a small local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Florida.
In airport detention since then, she has been contesting the exclusion, with the backing of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, where she was due to begin a year-long master's program on Sunday. 
On Friday, Tel Aviv District Court rejected Alqasem's appeal to be allowed in. On Sunday, her lawyers said she filed a dual motion to Israel's Supreme Court to block her looming deportation and consider a last-ditch appeal for entry.
""A stay has been issued against the deportation, and the appeal motion will be heard this week,"" a court spokesman said. 
Her case has touched off debate in Israel over whether democratic values have been compromised by a 2017 law that bars the entry of foreigners who publicly support anti-Israel boycotts, and if a hard line against the student would ultimately harm the country's image.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's stance was similar to other countries' practices.
""If ... you're virulently against America and you try to come into the United States, there's a good chance you won't be let in,"" he told visiting Christian journalists. ""That's also true of many of the European democracies. It's true of the democracy called Israel."" 
His government says Students for Justice activities included a campaign to boycott Sabra hummus, made and sold in the United States by a company partly owned by a firm in Israel.
Israel sees such groups, and the wider Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, not only as an attempt to isolate it over its occupation of territory which Palestinians seek for a state, but also as a campaign for its destruction.
Alqasem, who is of Palestinian descent, stopped her activities in the Students for Justice group months before the anti-boycott law came into effect, has pledged not to take part in boycott activities while in Israel and did not plan to visit the West Bank, her attorneys have said.
Israel's Supreme Court rarely agrees to hear appeals over administrative matters ruled on by lower courts, Alqasem lawyer Leora Bechor said. ""It needs very unique circumstances,"" she told Reuters.

Bechor said Alqasem could have opted to fly back to the United States, but had chosen to remain in airport detention, where she had only intermittent access to phone communication and had been denied reading and writing materials.

GENEVA/ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamic State in Nigeria might kill healthcare workers it has held hostage since March within 24 hours, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Sunday, calling for mercy and urging Nigeria's government to intervene. 
Medical workers Hauwa Mohammed Liman and Alice Loksha were working in the town of Rann when they were kidnapped along with ICRC midwife Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa, who was killed in September, the ICRC said in a statement. 
The armed group was also holding a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu, who was abducted in February from her school in the town of Dapchi, it said. 
Militants allied to Islamic State said in a video posted online last month that they would kill their hostages within a period of time that is due to elapse on Monday. 
""Speed and urgency are critical. A deadline that could result in the killing of another healthcare worker is less than 24 hours away,"" the ICRC said in a statement, without giving further details on the deadline or its conditions.
""We urge you: spare and release these women. They are a midwife, a nurse and a student. Like all those abducted, they are not part of any fight,"" Patricia Danzi, director of ICRC operations in Africa, was quoted as saying in the statement.
The ICRC said the militants recently confirmed the deadline to them. Demands being made in exchange for the release of their hostages have not been reported. 
Two spokesmen for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari declined to comment.
Last week a government delegation led by the minister of information traveled to the northeastern city of Maiduguri for talks with relatives of the hostages. 
Liman was working as a midwife at an ICRC-supported hospital, while Loksha was a nurse working with UNICEF. 
The Geneva-based ICRC, which often works behind the scenes for humanitarian goals in war zones, identified the kidnappers as members of ISWA - Islamic State's offshoot in West Africa, after previously declining to name the group.
Islamic State in West Africa split from the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram in 2016 and has killed hundreds of soldiers in attacks in northeastern Nigeria in the past few months, security and military sources have told Reuters.

Like Boko Haram, ISWA wants to create a separate state in northeast Nigeria that adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Five South Korean climbers and their four Nepali guides have been killed after their basecamp in the Himalayas was ravaged by a storm, local police and hiking officials said on Sunday.
The disaster, which claimed the life of record-breaking Korean climber Kim Chang-ho, is the worst climbing accident to hit the Himalayan nation in two years.
Police official Bir Bahadur Budhamagar said rescuers helped by locals retrieved the bodies of the nine climbers on Sunday from near their basecamp at Mount Gurja, a 7,193 metre-high peak (23,600 feet), located roughly 216 km (135 miles) northwest of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.
""The bodies of all five Koreans and four Nepalis have been identified,"" Budhamagar told Reuters from Myagdi district where the disaster took place.
On Saturday, police said locals had spotted seven bodies on the mountain slopes, but emergency workers were unable to retrieve them due to bad weather.
The Korean expedition was being led by Chang-ho, who set the record in 2013 for being the fastest to reach the summits of the world's 14 highest mountains without using supplemental oxygen, according to climbing officials. 
The victims included a four-man Korean team to the Gurja mountain. They were at the base camp located at 3,500 meters (11,482) at the time of the storm. The fifth Korean was a trekker, who joined the group, according to hiking officials.
Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, and the autumn climbing season is now at its peak. Income from foreign climbers is a major source of revenue for the cash-strapped nation.

ROME (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Sunday defended his decision to move hundreds of migrants out of a southern Italian town widely seen as a model of successful integration as opposition groups accused him of racism.
Riace, a small town in Calabria, Italy's southern toe, has been in the spotlight since its mayor, Domenico Lucano, was arrested this month for allegedly favoring illegal immigration, sparking protests by residents and pro-migrant groups.
Salvini, leader of the right-wing League, celebrated the arrest, and this weekend announced that Riace's mainly African migrants would be moved out and spread around the country.
He said the decision was necessary to end abuses in the use of funds that previous governments had made available to the town for its projects to house and integrate migrants.
""We cannot tolerate irregularities in the use of public money, even under the excuse of spending it for migrants,"" said Salvini, whose party's support has surged on the back of his tough line against illegal immigration. 
The decision was met with a barrage of criticism on Sunday from the leftist opposition and pro-migrant activists.
""We have to say with force that the action undertaken by Salvini against the Riace model is a vile act,"" said Nicola Zingaretti, president of the central Lazio region, who is bidding for leadership of the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
Riace's integration efforts have won prizes and drawn international acclaim for opening the town's doors to thousands of refugees, integrating them into society and revitalizing a dwindling local population.
Over 300 citizens of Riace's 2,000 inhabitants are immigrants, according to deputy mayor Giuseppe Gervasi. Over the years the town has welcomed hundreds more but many have moved on to other European countries, he said.
Lucano, who has been mayor since 2002, was listed by Fortune magazine as one of the world's top 50 leaders in 2016.
Salvini said there would be no turning back and accused the PD of hypocrisy, saying the investigation into the misuse of funds in Riace had been launched by Marco Minniti, interior minister under the previous, PD-led government in 2017.
The head of Italy's network of migrant reception centers said there was no question of migrants housed in Riace being deported, and they would be found alternative places to stay elsewhere in Italy.

The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which governs with the League, has given Salvini a free hand in pursuing his immigration clampdown, which has focused mainly on preventing migrant boats from Libya arriving on Italy's shores.

The move coincides with a period of fraught relations between Turkey and the United States and comes after other politically charged name changes to streets in Ankara. 
In February, the city renamed the street outside the current U.S. Embassy ""Olive Branch"", which is what Turkey called one of its military campaigns in Syria. Ankara is at odds with Washington over its backing of forces led by the Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey views as a terrorist group.
Radical U.S. civil rights leader Malcolm X remains a divisive figure in U.S. history and Ankara's move will likely be received negatively by critics who say he stirred racist and anti-U.S. sentiment. 
""The street was given the name of U.S. Muslim politician and human rights defender Malcolm X, about whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 'we will make his name live on in Ankara,"" Ankara's municipality said in a statement published by Anadolu news agency on Saturday.
Last month, Erdogan met Malcolm X's daughters during a visit to New York. Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin shared the story about the name change on his Twitter account on Sunday.
A major row between Washington and Ankara appeared to have ended on Friday when American pastor Andrew Brunson was released on after two years in Turkish custody, a move which President Donald Trump said was a ""tremendous step"" toward improved relations.
Construction of the new U.S. embassy in Ankara is scheduled for completion in 2020.

Last December, the mayor of Ankara ordered the street of the United Arab Emirates mission to be renamed after the Ottoman former governor of Medina, following a row between the two countries about the state of the holy city under Ottoman rule.

MALE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Maldivians protested on Sunday demanding the arrest of defeated President Abdulla Yameen as its top court began to hear a petition challenging the outcome of last's month election in the island nation.
The tourist archipelago has been in political turmoil since February, when a state of emergency was imposed by Yameen, whose critics have accused him of running Maldives with an iron fist, jailing political opponents and Supreme Court judges.
""This is our right. They can't change it. They can't play around with the votes,"" Abidha Afeef, a 55-year old protester told Reuters. ""Yameen has to go."" 
Yameen initially conceded defeat last month after an official count showed joint opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had won the election by a margin of 16.8 percent in a surprise result. 
The Maldives Election Commission said the vote was free and fair, with turnout of 89.2 percent. And the opposition has been trying to secure a smooth transition of power, due on Nov. 17.
Last week however, Yameen's lawyers approached the Supreme Court, saying supporters had complained about rigging of votes and fraudulent ballot papers.
Four members of the Election Commission have fled the island nation, due to alleged intimidation and threats, Reuters reported on Saturday. Yameen's party has dismissed the allegations. [L4N1WT044]
The allegations from Commission officials follow some domestic media reports of a complaint to police by the company that printed the ballots. The complaint alleged Yameen's party attempted to bribe its workers to give false statements backing Yameen's challenge.
Yameen's party called the complaint ""ludicrous"", saying it was a tactic to divert attention from the court case.
The country of some 400,000 people is popular with tourists, and being located near key shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean it has become important as China and India compete for influence in the region.
China is engaged in building up the islands' infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to boost trade and transport links across Asia.

Yet despite their ideological differences, they live under the same roof in rebel-held Idlib province and have fought on the same side against pro-Assad forces and Islamic State.

Abu Yousef, 27, belongs to the jihadist Tahrir al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front. He believes the brothers' ""points of agreement are greater than the points of division.""
""We are members of one religion, one country and one goal"", he said.
Their parallel journeys through the civil war that began in Syria in 2011 illustrate the complexities of sorting insurgents deemed ""radical"" from more moderate rebels.
This is the task facing Turkey as it seeks to shore up a deal with Russia over Idlib, which is part of an arc of rebel-held territory at the Turkish border. 
The province is part of the opposition's last big foothold in Syria and is effectively -- at least for now -- in a zone of Turkish influence under the agreement reached last month. 
Russia expects Turkey to bring about a separation of insurgents, with ""radical"" rebels to leave a newly created demilitarised zone at the frontline with government forces by Monday. Turkey says the ""moderates"" can stay where they are.
The Turkey-backed groups, gathered under the umbrella of the National Liberation Front (NLF), have said they will cooperate with Turkey's efforts, despite some misgivings.
The tougher part for Turkey is bringing the jihadists into line, particularly foreign fighters estimated to number in the thousands. President Tayyip Erdogan has suggested Tahrir al-Sham is cooperating, though the group has yet to comment on the deal.
BATTLING ASSAD'S FORCES
The experiences of Abu Yousef and Abu Eliyas show that the line between the ""radical"" and ""moderate"" rebels is not always easily drawn.
Abu Eliyas is a trained lawyer with seven children who was working as a government employee when the conflict began. He took part in the first protests against Assad in the brothers' home town of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria.
""They were unforgettable days. The feeling was very strange for us – that we are in Syria and going out in protest against the regime and the Assad family,"" he said.
Abu Eliyas took up arms with a Free Syrian Army group early in the conflict. 
After seizing the area, Islamic State militants destroyed his house in Deir al-Zor by rigging it with explosives and then blowing it up in what he described as an act of revenge.
Abu Yousef, who is not married, was a student when the conflict began. He joined Nusra Front when it first emerged in Deir al-Zor, drawn by what he saw as the piety of its members, including foreigners.
Both fought Islamic State when it attacked eastern Syria in 2014 and went north with their family when IS conquered the area. Once there, Abu Eliyas joined Failaq al-Sham, and cited its standing in Turkey as one of the attractions. 
Failaq al-Sham has ties to the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which mounted an uprising in the 1980s and is deemed a terrorist group by the government. 
Close to Turkey, Failaq al-Sham was also one of the recipients of aid channeled through a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency program that was shut down by President Donald Trump.
Tahrir al-Sham has clashed several times with other rebels in the northwest, and crushed a number of foreign-backed factions. 
The brothers have always stayed out of these troubles, though enmity runs deep between the jihadists and some Idlib rebels. 
Tensions in Idlib have eased of late. Rebels formed a joint ""operations room"" in anticipation of an offensive by Syrian government forces that had been expected until Turkey and Russia struck their agreement last month.
Tahrir al-Sham, with which Abu Yousef fights, has widened contacts with other groups and been visiting their rivals, an official in a rival faction said.
""RUSSIAN TRAP""
If it holds, the agreement between Turkey and Russia could stabilize the map of the Syrian conflict for some time to come. Though Assad is still vowing to take back the area, an Idlib campaign without Russian support is seen as out of the question.
Writing in the Wall Street Journal last month, Erdogan said ""moderate rebels"" should be part of an ""international counter-terrorism operation"" that would target ""terrorist and extremist elements"" and ""bring to justice foreign fighters"".
Abu Yousef sees a conspiracy to weaken the rebellion by dividing opposition forces. 
""The Russian-Turkish agreement is a tactic to finish off what remains of the areas held by the revolution,"" he said. ""We must depend on ourselves, and nobody else.""
Despite his faith in Turkey, Abu Eliyas is also worried. 

""Failaq al-Sham's relationship with Turkey secured many benefits for the region ... but we fear the Turks will fall into the Russian trap that aims to disarm Tahrir al-Sham,"" he said.

Sweden has been in a state of political deadlock since a Sept. 9 election when neither the Alliance bloc - headed by Kristersson - nor a grouping of centre-left parties won enough votes for a majority and both ruled out a deal with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who hold the balance of power.
Kristersson said on Friday he was prepared to try to form a minority government without all the parties in the four-party Alliance bloc, but the Liberal and Centre parties of his bloc scuppered the plan by refusing to back it.
""I have done what I can, for now,"" Kristersson said on Sunday as he told the speaker he was giving up his attempts to form a government for the moment.
The speaker has four attempts to find a prime minister acceptable to parliament or there will be another election. The speaker said on Sunday he would talk to the parties on Monday and hand someone else the task of forming the government.
The baton is likely to pass next to Stefan Lofven, the leader of the Social Democrats and current caretaker prime minister. He lost a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Sept. 25.
But if other candidates fail Kristersson can be handed a second chance.

""I'm disappointed that (the Alliance) is now missing an opportunity to form a new government with a new policy... I'm still ready to be prime minister and to lead an Alliance government,"" Kristersson said.

PARIS (Reuters) - A French prosecutor has recommended dropping charges against eight senior Rwandan officials, including the defense minister, who were being investigated over the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in 1994, a judicial source told Reuters.
The probe, opened in France in 1998 following demands by relatives of the French crew who died when Habyarimana's plane was downed, has led to major tensions between France and Rwanda over the past two decades.
It is now up to investigative magistrates to decide whether to stop the investigation or carry it on and take it to a tribunal. Judges do not necessarily follow prosecutors' recommendations. 
Habyarimana's killing triggered a genocide in which ethnic Hutu extremists killed more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
The prosecutor made its recommendation to shut the case on Wednesday, saying the investigation had not brought sufficient evidence, the judicial source said. 
Rwandan Defence Minister James Kabarebe was one of the officials targeted by the investigation.
Lawyers for the people targeted by the probe welcomed the prosecutor's recommendation, but Philippe Meilhac, a lawyer for Agathe Habyarimana, the former president's widow, criticized it as a political move, which comes at a time when Paris is seeking to mend ties with Kigali.
""This has political motives,"" Meilhac told Reuters. The prosecutor's office could not immediately be reached for comment.
Rwanda's foreign minister was named head of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) on Friday, a sign of slowly improving relations between Paris and Kigali.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced his support for Louise Mushikiwabo's candidacy during a visit to Paris earlier this year by Rwandan leader Paul Kagame, who has long accused France of complicity in the 1994 genocide.

MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - The hunt for missing people in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael early Sunday is turning into a search for the dead, as hope of finding more people alive fades in the Florida Panhandle, U.S. officials said.
""We're going into recovery mode, unfortunately,"" said Fire Chief Alex Baird of Panama City, one of the coastal Florida communities clobbered by the hurricane that made landfall Wednesday as a Category 4 storm, packing more than 140 mph winds and deadly storm surges.
""At sunrise, we'll start again on our search,"" Baird said. ""We hope that we'll find more (survivors), but it's more and more doubtful.""
President Donald Trump is expected to visit both Florida and Georgia early this week to inspect the damage, and the White House said late Saturday the president was fully committed to helping state and local agencies with the recovery.
The death toll of the storm reached at least 18 Saturday night and is expected to rise in the U.S. Southeast as rescuers go door-to-door in coastal communities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.
Search and rescue volunteers have already located hundreds of people reported missing last week.
On Saturday, rescue crews heard cries for help and crowbarred into a mobile home crumpled by the storm in Panama City, freeing a mother and daughter, both diabetics who had been trapped in a closet without insulin for two days and were on the verge of diabetic shock, rescuers said.
A lack of food and water is among the most pressing issues for people reeling from the storm, said one volunteer who had been working in the Panama City area.
Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for people in the rubble.
More than 1,700 search and rescue workers were deployed, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances, Florida Governor Rick Scott's office said.

Electricity and phone service were being slowly restored, but it could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged areas.

Leslie was downgraded from a hurricane before it reached Portugal late on Saturday. Authorities had urged people to stay indoors and keep away from coastal areas.
At least 1,000 trees were uprooted, mainly in coastal towns north of Lisbon where the storm first reached land, hitting power lines and blocking roads. 
The A1, the main motorway running through Portugal, was temporarily blocked by a fallen tree, authorities said.
More than 300,000 homes lost electricity as the storm passed, said Belo Costa, commander at the Civil Protection Agency.
The storm, carrying winds of up 100 km/h (60 mph), was most intense during the night. By Sunday morning the powerful winds and heavy rains had mostly subsided.
In Spain, winds of up to 100 km/h uprooted trees in the center of the country early on Sunday morning. Emergency services issued flood warnings for the north and northwest of the country for Sunday afternoon and evening, advising Spaniards to avoid driving in the storm.

But Abu Nimr did not budge.
He has remained in his family home with his dog through bombs, siege, and fierce battles for more than seven years, raising pigeons on his roof even as people fled in droves. 
Since the army clawed back the enclave around five months ago, he has helped clear heaps of rubble from the streets and repair abandoned houses. 
""My siblings and I lived in this building. They're all married. They left so their kids could go to school,"" Abu Nimr told Reuters in the Yarmouk Palestinian camp in the Syrian capital.
""I thought I'd stay here alone, keep an eye on the family property, and hoped things would be resolved within days. But seven years passed, God kept me patient.""
Abu Nimr, who is originally Palestinian, owned a shop selling sweets like baklawa before the conflict. 
At the onset, he stored food from the empty houses of his relatives. As supplies dwindled, he often slept hungry. 
""I took a decision seven years ago that weapons are not my thing. Bloodshed is not easy,"" he said. 
Abu Nimr, 36, did odd jobs over the years and spent time with his dog Balo. ""He was my friend through the siege, and I relied on him to guard the house when I went out."" 
When the fighting got too close, he would hide in the furthest room with a hammer in case he had to dig himself out.
The violence has turned his neighborhood into a ghost town, with twisted metal and collapsed walls still blocking some streets. Others are closed off with signs warning of landmines.
By the time the last battle came this year, after scores of residents had escaped or died, only 16 people were left in his neighborhood. 
But he refused to leave. ""The people fled? The warplanes dropped bombs? The militants entered? It doesn't matter.""
Now, Abu Nimr wants to bring life back to Yarmouk and hopes people will be able to return soon. 
Former neighbors and residents call him from other parts of Syria or abroad, asking him to check on their homes. They send him some money to clean up and repair damages. 
State employees and volunteers have opened all of the main roads, he said. ""We help with what we can."" 

""Praise God, now things are much better."" If not for the war, Abu Nimr believes he would be married with kids now. ""If people come back and it gets better, I will re-open a sweets shop right away.""

Tensions have increased between Iran and America after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multi-lateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program in May.
""In the past 40 years there has not been a more spiteful team than the current U.S. government team toward Iran, Iranians and the Islamic Republic,"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state TV. 
""There was a time when there was one person who had enmity. The rest were moderate. Now...the worst have gathered around each other,"" he added in a speech marking the beginning of the academic year at Tehran University. 
Rouhani accused the Americans of using psychological and economic warfare and questioning the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic.
""Reducing the legitimacy of the system is their final goal. When they say getting rid of, regime change in their own words, how does regime change happen? Through reducing legitimacy, otherwise a regime doesn't change,"" 
He used the English phrase ""regime change"" to emphasize his point.
Washington reintroduced steps against Iran's currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August. 
With U.S. curbs on Iran's oil exports set to come into force next month, some Iranians fear their country is entering an economic slump that may prove worse than the period from 2012 to 2015, when it last faced major sanctions.
Vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri played down the impact of the planned restrictions. Iran has been able to find new partners to buy its oil even though some countries have stopped purchases, Jahangiri said on Sunday, according to Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).
""America will certainly not be able to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero,"" he said. 

""America thinks Saudi Arabia can replace this oil. But right now Iran's oil has reached more than $80 and with half the previous exports we will have the same income as before,"" he added on comments on the IRIB website.

The Taliban have ramped up attacks in strategic provinces in their battle to expel foreign forces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law.
The police chief of Mizan, a district in southern Zabul province, was killed in armed clashes with Taliban insurgents on Saturday night, the provincial governor, Rahmatullah Yarmal, said.
In the western province of Farah, Taliban fighters killed 21 troops at two checkpoints in the district of Posht-e Rud.
The Taliban captured 11 soldiers and seized their weapons, added Gul Ahmad Faqiri, a member of the Farah provincial council.
The hardline Islamist militant group claimed the attacks.
""Our fighters have killed the police chief and 25 Afghan soldiers in two provinces on Saturday night,"" its spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahidhe, said in a statement.
Last week the Taliban ordered Afghans to boycott the elections, set for Oct. 20, saying the United States was using them for the sole purpose of legitimizing its authority and presence in the country.
The vote, seen by the Afghan government's international partners as a dry run for presidential elections next year, has been hampered by chaotic preparations, allegations of fraud and ever-present fears of militant violence.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Slain Salvadoran bishop Romero and Pope Paul VI become saints,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday made saints of two of the most contentious Roman Catholic figures of the 20th century -- murdered Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero and Pope Paul VI, who reigned over one of the Church's most turbulent eras and enshrined its opposition to contraception.
In a ceremony before tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), Francis declared the two men saints along with five other lesser-known people who were born in Italy, Germany and Spain in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Both Romero, who was shot by a right-wing death squad while saying Mass in 1980, and Paul, who guided the Church through the conclusion of the modernizing 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, were contested figures within and without the Church.
Both were naturally timid men who were thrust to the forefront of history by the convulsive political and social changes of the 20th century and both had a lasting influence on the current pontiff, Francis, Latin America's first pope.
In his homily, read with tapestries of images of the seven new saints hanging from St. Peter's Basilica behind him, Francis called Pope Paul ""a prophet of an extroverted Church"" who opened it up to the world. He praised Romero for disregarding his own life ""to be close to the poor and to his people"". 
Romero, who had often denounced repression and poverty in his homilies, was shot dead on March 24, 1980, in a hospital chapel in San Salvador, the capital of the impoverished Central American country of El Salvador.
Romero's murder was one of the most shocking in the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in which thousands were killed by right-wing and military death squads.
It was widely believed to have been ordered by Roberto D'Aubuisson, an army major and founder of the right-wing ARENA party. He died of cancer in 1992.
Romero consistently denounced violence by the Salvadoran military and paramilitary against civilians and urged the international community to stop the oppression.
In his final homily, minutes before he was shot in the heart, Romero spoke of spreading ""the benefits of human dignity, brotherhood and freedom across the earth ....""
75,000 KILLED
The 1980-1992 war in El Salvador between the U.S.-backed army and the Marxist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which later became the ruling party, left 75,000 dead and 8,000 missing.
Romero became an icon for Latin America's poor, appearing on T-shirts similar to those bearing the image of Che Guevara, but his sainthood cause ran into stiff opposition in the Vatican and among powerful conservatives in the Latin American Church.
Both feared that Romero had become too political in life and even more so in death.
The process languished for decades. Francis speeded it up after his election in 2013 and in 2015 the Vatican declared that Romero had died a martyr, killed out of hatred for the faith.
""His martyrdom continued (even after his death). He was defamed, slandered ... even by his own brothers in the priesthood and the episcopate, Francis said in 2015. ""(He was hit by) ""the hardest stone that exists in the world: the tongue.""
""POPE HAMLET""
Paul VI, a shy man described by biographers as a sometimes indecisive and tormented Hamlet-type figure, guided the Church through the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council, which had started under his predecessor, and the implementation of its reforms. He was elected in 1963 and died in 1978.
Francis often quotes Paul, showing that he is committed to the reforms of the Council, which allowed the Mass to be said in local languages instead of Latin, declared respect for other religions, and launched a landmark reconciliation with Jews.
Still today, ultra-conservatives in the Church do not recognize the Council's teachings and blame Paul for starting what they see as a decline in tradition. 
Paul reigned in the 1960s when many men left the priesthood and vocations fell sharply in a turbulent era of social change that coincided with the sexual revolution and the widespread availability of the birth control pill.
Despite his many reforms, Paul is perhaps best known for his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae (On Human Life), which enshrined the Church's ban on artificial birth control, saying nothing should block the possible transmission of human life.
The ban, which Paul issued against the advice of a papal commission, became the most contested Church ruling of the 20th century and is still widely disregarded by Catholics.
Paul also became the first pope in modern times to travel outside Italy to see faithful, ushering in a practice which has become synonymous with the papacy.

Paul is the third pope that Francis has made a saint since his election in 2013. The others are John XXIII, who died in 1963, and John Paul, who died in 2005.

The multilateral lender said the fund will also give a $5 million grant for technical assistance to ensure reconstruction is robust and community-led, it said in a statement.
The World Bank's chief executive officer Kristalina Georgieva on Friday visited the city of Palu, which was rocked by a 7.5-magnite earthquake and a tsunami on Sep. 28. More than 2,000 people died in Palu and its surrounding areas.
In the resort island of Lombok, over 500 people were killed by a series of earthquakes in July and August. 
Indonesia is hosting the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Bali, just west of Lombok.
The World Bank said its preliminary report showed that the physical loss from damage on the infrastructure, residential and non-residential property in Sulawesi was around $531 million. It noted that the report did not take into account loss of life, lost land or the disruption to the economy through lost jobs, livelihoods and business.
The loan facility package could include cash transfers to the poorest 150,000 affected families for a period between 6 months to one year, which could help during the recovery phase, the bank said.

Voting began at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and was due to end at 2 p.m. with most results expected in the evening.
Surveys indicate that the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) - which was led for 19 years by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and is by far the biggest group - will end Xavier Bettel's five years as prime minister.
However, the CSV could fall short of an outright majority in the 60-seat chamber, meaning its leader Claude Wiseler would need an ally in one of the three governing parties - Bettel's Democratic Party, the Socialist Worker's Party or the Greens.
Those parties took advantage of voters' discontent in 2013 when Juncker called a snap election after a wire-tapping scandal, pushing the CSV out of government for the first time since the war.
However, the foreign policy of the European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is unlikely to change much.
To avoid isolation in the EU, Luxembourg has been adapting its economic model, recently ending bank secrecy under pressure from bigger neighbors which have called it a center for tax avoidance.
Financial services is the largest sector in the Grand Duchy's economy, which was once dominated by steel.
Unlike some neighbors, where real or feared migration has boosted anti-immigrant parties, the far right has made no inroads in Luxembourg. However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners, mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.

KAMAKO, Democratic Republic of Congo/LUANDA (Reuters) - Congolese migrants and officials said dozens of people were killed this month in neighboring Angola in a crackdown on artisanal diamond mining, an accusation Angolan security forces strongly denied.
Angola, the world's fifth largest diamond producer, has launched an operation in recent weeks to clear tens of thousands of people involved in digging for precious stones in the northeast of the country in order to attract more private investment.
Many of them are from neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and hundreds of thousands of people have poured over the border into the Kasai region, border guards there told Reuters.
In interviews with Reuters, more than 20 Congolese migrants who crossed the border between October 4-12 described violence, looting and forced displacement by Angolan security forces as well as a local tribe called the Tshokwe.
The worse of the violence, they said, occurred in the town of Lucapa, located some 100 km south of the border with DRC in the heart of the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province.
Angolan security forces stormed the town, according to 15 witnesses, killing dozens of people, burning down homes, looting property and forcing people to leave. Some of those people were legally residing in Angola, the witnesses added.
""There was a lot of violence in Lucapa. The military was shooting at us while Tshowke were killing people with machetes. They jointly killed more than a dozen people,"" said Victor Tshambapoko, 28, who worked as a diamond digger in the region.
Reuters could not independently verify the accusations.
Angolan Police Commissioner Antonio Bernardo, spokesman for the operation, denied there had been rights abuses by security forces, and said the only fatality he knew of was in a traffic accident.
""We have no record of any burning of homes, much less reprisals and or assaults on anyone,"" he told Reuters.
""Angola and its government appeals to the common sense of the international community to realize that there is no underlying xenophobia, but only the legitimate normalizing of the socio-economic life of the country and national security.""
Amadhou Kabaseke Taty, Kasai's provincial director of the Congolese border agency (DGM) told Reuters that he believed there had been ""serious violations of human rights"" during the Angolan operation.
""I am worried about the situation,"" he said. ""Congolese people have been expelled in degrading conditions. They have been molested, beaten and killed, especially in Lucapa, by the Angolan military police.""
FEARS OVER STABILITY
Angolan President Joao Lourenco is trying to boost investments in his country and wean it off a heavy reliance on oil exports.
Reforming the diamond industry is part of that drive, and ""Operation Transparency"" in Lunda Norte aims to reduce diamond smuggling and raise more revenues for state coffers from the lucrative sector.
Several Congolese migrants who entered from Angola in recent days said the authorities there had given them an Oct. 15 deadline to leave. Border guard officials said the Angolan operation began on Oct. 1.
According to an internal DGM document seen by Reuters, 200,000 people crossed into Kasai region from Angola in the first 12 days of October.
Border officials believe the true figure is higher because people also cross through the bush rather than checkpoints.
The need to resettle so many people threatens to further destabilize Kasai, a region which saw widespread violence involving armed groups and government forces in 2016 and 2017.
Security sources in DRC and Angola have already said they are concerned about heightened tensions in the area in the run-up to Congolese elections in December.
A Reuters reporter in the Congolese border town of Kamako saw thousands of people making their way on foot and in trucks along the red dirt road to Tshikapa, the provincial capital of Kasai located some 50 km to the north.
Exhausted men and women rested by the side of the road, washed in a river or picked fruit from giant mango trees to feed themselves on a journey that lasts up to a week.

Many carried household belongings on their head, including plastic chairs, mattresses, animals and even ovens. Some said they also had diamonds in their possession.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - In 1980, a day after urging El Salvador's military to halt a string of abuses that would inflame a 12-year civil war in the impoverished country, Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero was shot dead while leading Mass.
His homilies had blasted the U.S.-backed military dictatorship while voicing solidarity with the poor, making him a Latin American human rights icon.
On Sunday at the Vatican, he will become a Roman Catholic saint.
Romero was considered for canonization decades ago, but his nomination stalled on concerns that he was overly political.
His reputation rebounded in 2015, when Pope Francis, a fellow Latin American committed to defending the poor, declared him a martyr who had been killed for hatred of the faith.
Romero critiqued the military government and armed leftist groups alike. That earned him animosity from both sides ahead of a civil war that lasted until 1992, leaving some 75,000 people dead and sending thousands of Salvadorans fleeing to the United States.
In 1980, at a church altar, he found a bomb meant to take his life.
""Persecution is necessary in the Church. Do you know why? Because the truth is always persecuted,"" he said at the time. 
Two weeks later, undeterred by death threats, the man distinguished by his bushy eyebrows and thick glasses spoke directly to soldiers.
""I beg you, I beseech you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression,"" he said.
The following day, a sniper killed the 62-year-old as he delivered Mass at a hospital chapel in the capital. The main suspect is a former soldier.
Romero's murder was one of the most shocking of the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in which right-wing and military death squads killed thousands.
CARPENTRY TO SAINTHOOD
Romero was born in 1917 in a small coffee-growing town in Honduras, the second of eight brothers. As a boy, he apprenticed as a carpenter before entering the seminary and studying theology in Rome.
In 1943, he returned to El Salvador as a parish priest until becoming Archbishop of San Salvador in 1977. The military's killing, kidnapping and arrests of priests who supported workers' rights turned him into a staunch critic of the regime. 
The Vatican said the miracle cementing his sainthood was the 2015 survival of Cecilia Flores, whose husband prayed to Romero when she was close to death in pregnancy.
""Doctors told my husband ... only a miracle will save your wife,"" Flores said. After her husband began praying, she instantly recovered and gave birth to a healthy son, she added. 
Salvadoran Cardinal Jose Gregorio Rosa said Romero's sainthood will serve as an example for religious leaders as well as the faithful.

""It's the greatest thing a human being can achieve, an incredible joy,"" he said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia has agreed to resume a search effort with the United States for the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War, the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, after suspending the program a year ago as tension rose between the two countries.
Prime Minister Hun Sen suspended the POW/MIA program when Washington stopped issuing some visas after Cambodia refused to accept citizens deported from the United States following their convictions for crimes there.
Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Ket Sophann said Hun Sen had offered to resume cooperation in a letter on Friday to U.S. Senator Doug Ericksen and Representative Vincent Buys. 
""The letter talks to this itself, especially the words: it is the reflection of our deep empathy with the families,"" Ket Sophann told Reuters. 
Hun Sen said the search program, which had run for 30 years until being suspended last year, would resume even though the visa curbs had ""unjustly sanctioned"" Cambodia.
""As we have discussed before, and at your personal request, as well as that made by other U.S. organizations, my government, in the same compassionate spirit, agreed to resume this important POW/MIA field mission, regardless (of) the United States visa restriction in place,"" Hun Sen wrote.
The U.S. Embassy in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh declined to comment. 
Hun Sen has said that the remains of half of the 80 American soldiers who went missing in Cambodia during the war in neighboring Vietnam have been found.
Even after it ended in 1975, the Vietnam War remains an emotive issue in Cambodia.
Hun Sen's ruling party won all 125 parliamentary seats in a July election the United Nations and Western countries have described as flawed after the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved over accusations of plotting to topple the government.

Hun Sen has accused the United States of plotting treason with opposition leader Kem Sokha, an accusation rejected by Washington.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Two New Zealand pro-Palestinian activists have raised NZ$14,000 ($9,108.40) as of Sunday for charity after being fined by an Israeli court for their alleged role in persuading pop star Lorde to cancel a concert in Tel Aviv last year.
Justine Sachs and Nadia Abu-Shanab said last week they would not pay the fine of 45,000 shekels ($12,423.05) awarded to three Israeli teenagers, calling the court's ruling a ""stunt"" intended to intimidate Israel's critics.
Instead, they asked people to donate money through website ""givealittle.co.nz"" to the Gaza Mental Health Foundation, a volunteer group that raises funds for mental health and women's empowerment groups in the Gaza Strip.
As of Sunday, they raised NZ$14,000, according to the website.
""Given that we've actually had this kind of push upon us – we felt that it was expedient to actually recenter the issue back on Palestine,"" Abu-Shanab told Radio New Zealand.
The case arose from an open letter that Sachs and Abu-Shanab wrote to Lorde, a New Zealander, on the website ""thespinoff.co.nz"" in December urging her to call off her planned concert.
Lorde canceled her concert in Israel that same month after a campaign by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) group, which campaigns for Palestinian rights, that included the open letter published by Sachs and Abu-Shanab.

According to the latest polls, the Christian Social Union (CSU) will win around 34 percent, losing the absolute majority with which the center-right party has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of the post-war period.
Voting stations open at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and broadcasters are expected to publish exit polls shortly after 6 pm (1600 GMT).
One of the biggest winners are likely to be the ecologist, pro-immigration Greens who are projected to more than double their vote share to up to 19 percent and overtake the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) as the second-strongest party.
The regional protest party Free Voters and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party are both forecast to win roughly 10 percent of the votes.
This could complicate CSU State Premier Markus Soeder's efforts to form a stable coalition government in Bavaria.
The splintered electoral result could force Soeder, who has ruled out a coalition with the AfD, into an awkward alliance with the left-of-center Greens.
Horst Seehofer, CSU party leader and interior minister in Merkel's federal government, could face calls to give up at least one of his posts following the Bavarian election as his hard-line rhetoric against asylum seekers is likely to scare away voters.
""We've lost trust because of the CSU,"" Volker Bouffier, deputy party leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. He accused Seehofer of damaging the image of the CDU/CSU conservative alliance.
Bouffier is premier in the state of Hesse where another regional election will be held later this month.
Seehofer has been among Merkel's fiercest critics following her decision in 2015 to welcome more than 1 million migrants. He has gradually shifted the CSU, the sister party to the CDU, to the right to counter the rise of the AfD party.
Divisions between the conservative allies have widened further since March, when an inconclusive national election forced them into a coalition with the left-leaning SPD.

Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already come close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration and a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster. The parties are also at odds over how to phase out polluting diesel cars and whether to grant tax cuts for the rich.

SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people, including families and women carrying babies, set off from Honduras toward the United States on Saturday, days after the United States urged Honduras' president to halt mass migration. 
Recent attempts at group crossings from Central America to the United States have tested U.S. President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" stance on illegal immigration, as people fleeing violence and poverty defy threats of deportation.
""I believe we'll get to the United States. There's no work in Honduras, and you live in fear that they're going to kill you or your children,"" said Fanny Barahona, 35, an unemployed teacher who walked with her nine-year-old son and carried a two-year-old daughter.
Some 1,300 people joined the so-called ""March of the Migrant,"" planning to walk from San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras through Guatemala and into Mexico, organizer Bartolo Fuentes said. Once in Mexico, they plan to request refugee status to remain in the country or a visa to pass through to the U.S. border, he said. 
In April, media attention on a similar group of migrants, dubbed a ""caravan,"" prompted Trump to press for tougher border security and demand such groups be refused entry. Most in the caravan said they were fleeing death threats, extortion and violence from powerful street gangs.
More than 64 percent of Honduran households live in poverty, and San Pedro Sula has one of the world's highest murder rates.
""There is no work and so much violence that you can get killed walking down the street,"" said Javier Solis, 25, who said he has not found work in a year and wants to enter the United States. On a previous attempt, he was deported to Honduras upon reaching Mexico.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met with the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in Washington on Thursday and told them the United States would be willing to help with economic development and investment if they did more to tackle migration, corruption and gang violence.

Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said U.S. funding was declining, and he called on the United States to reunite migrant children with their parents after Washington's policy of separating families trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border put Honduras under ""huge pressure.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The top economic adviser to Brazilian far-right presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro said he favors selling off some of the power generation assets of utility company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A., raising new contradictions in the candidate's policy team.
Shares of the company, known as Eletrobras, soared following the clear lead Bolsonaro took in Sunday's first-round vote, but then tumbled 13 percent on Wednesday when Bolsonaro said he would privatize transmission and distribution units but not the generation of electricity. Bolsonaro had previously promised to privatize some state-controlled companies. 
But in comments to reporters late on Friday, his economic guru Paulo Guedes gave a contradictory view, saying he favored selling Eletrobras generation assets rather than transmission assets. 
""Transmission, that's very difficult, but in the case of generation there are cases where I would sell and others where I wouldn't,"" Guedes told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. ""There are many cases of strong private generation.""
Bolsonaro has named Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist, to be his economy and finance super minister, a clear signal that he plans to be a market-friendly president if he defeats leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad in the Oct. 28 run-off vote.
Yet Bolsonaro has disavowed Guedes publicly on occasion, revealing wide divisions on policy among his team of advisers, which is divided between nationalists and free-market advocates. Divisions have emerged on taxation and wage policies and includes the potential privatization of Brazil's largest company, state-run oil corporation Petrobras.
Commenting on his reluctance to sell core Eletrobras units, Bolsonaro cited a concern about Chinese domination, which has bought electrical assets in Brazil in the past two years. 
""China isn't buying in Brazil, China is buying Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said. ""Are you willing to leave Brazil in the hands of the Chinese?""
Eletrobras has assets in generation, transmission and distribution. Both Bolsonaro and Guedes have remained consistent that they are in favor of selling distribution assets.
Bolsonaro's own record is not friendly to privatization. As a congressman, Bolsonaro has voted in the past to maintain Petrobras' monopoly over exploration and production. 

The privatization of Eletrobras is a vital step to help reduce Brazil's wide budget deficit. The outgoing government of President Michel Temer had hoped raise some 12.2 billion reais ($3.2 billion) from the sale, but failed to win Congressional approval.

MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Search and rescue volunteers have located hundreds of people reported missing in the U.S. Southeast after Hurricane Michael tore through their Florida Panhandle communities, but the death toll of at least 18 was expected to rise.
Rescue crews heard cries for help and cut into a mobile home crumpled by the storm in Panama City, freeing survivors who had been trapped inside for two days, Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, said on Saturday.
In door-to-door searches, teams consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters have found more than 520 of the 2,100 people reported missing since Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history. 
""We expect that number to go up dramatically today,"" Marchetti said, adding hopes were raised by an influx of volunteers on the weekend and the restoration of power in some areas. 
""Volunteers are working side-by-side with first responders. They are cutting holes in roofs. They try to take a picture so we can call the family and tell them we made contact,"" he said.
But as roads were cleared to allow wider searches, the death toll was expected to mount. As of early Saturday, authorities were reporting at least 18 deaths in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. 
Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for people in the rubble.
In Callaway, Florida, an especially hard-hit town, Catholic Christians barbecued hamburgers and Scientologists handed out water.
""I'm homeless,"" said nursing assistant Carla Covington, 45, who is caring for her mother and two children after their house was destroyed by falling trees.
She said it felt good to receive comfort, but was also hard.
""I'm used to helping people and not asking for help,"" she said, her voice breaking with emotion.
The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane, tore apart entire neighborhoods.
More than 1,700 search and rescue workers were deployed, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances, Florida Governor Rick Scott's office said.
Power and phone service were being slowly restored, with about 236,000 homes and businesses still without power in North Carolina, down from a peak of more than 600,000, said spokesman Keith Acree of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. 

It could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.

Reuters was unable to verify the circumstances of the incident independently. However, footage of the car, which a Reuters cameraman said bore Palestinian license plates, showed what appeared to be a blood-stained broken brick at the foot of the passenger seat, which was covered in shattered glass.
A doctor at the Palestinian hospital where Aisha al-Rawbi was brought said the 47-year-old was dead on arrival and that she had suffered a head injury. Her relatives said an autopsy was to be carried out.
The woman's husband, Aykube al-Rawbi, 52, said he was driving by a settlement late on Friday after dark along a main road near the Palestinian city of Nablus and that he could not see who pelted the car. 
""The stones came from the side where the settlement is. I could hear the people speak Hebrew, but I didn't see them,"" said al-Rawbi. 
Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said: ""Police arrived in the area and have opened an investigation."" An Israeli court issued a gag order on details of the inquiry.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement published by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa that it was ""an ugly crime"" perpetrated by settlers.
On Sunday, a Palestinian gunman shot dead two Israelis and wounded a third near a West Bank settlement and on Thursday the Israeli military said a Palestinian had stabbed an Israeli soldier in the area.
On Friday, Gaza health officials said Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in protests along Gaza's border. Israel said its troops had shot a group who broke through the fence with a bomb and attacked an army post.
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Saturday all fuel deliveries to Gaza will stop and resume only when border violence ends. Israel allowed two trucks of fuel across its border into Gaza on Tuesday in a Qatari- and U.N.-backed effort to ease conditions in the enclave.
Around 200 Palestinians have been killed since the border protests began on March 30, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Gaza sniper during the protests, and tracts of Israeli land have been scorched by incendiary kites and balloons sent across the border.
The protesters are demanding an end to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the enclave, which is home to around 2 million people. They also seek the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel's founding in 1948.
Israel says the blockade is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching militants, including Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza and which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008. 
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and a bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to restart them has shown little progress so far. 
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem -- territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Settlements Israel has built in the West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self-rule, are deemed illegal by most countries. Israel disputes this.

The victory marks Anwar's official return to political life just five months after he was freed from jail, and will also be the first time that both he and Mahathir are members of parliament under the same banner after a bitter feud lasting over 20 years.
Anwar, who has been the face of Malaysia's Reformasi or Reform movement over the past twenty years, won the seat by a majority of over 23,500 votes despite a low voter turnout on polling day in the coastal parliamentary seat of Port Dickson.
""Reform doesn't end in one month, or four months, or a year. Reform means cleaning up and freeing the media, removing corruption, making ethical behavior a culture in politics,"" he told supporters at a victory rally, broadcast live on social media.
""I would like to tell all of you who voted, and our friends from all over the country... I will not waste this trust given to me,"" he said to cheers from hundreds gathered.
In May, Mahathir, 93, led the Pakatan Harapan, or Alliance of Hope, coalition to a spectacular victory in a general election, unseating his former protege Najib Razak and ending the 61-year rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition.
Anwar could not contest as he was in jail on a 2015 sodomy conviction, but his renewed partnership with Mahathir was key to the election win, after which Mahathir secured a royal pardon for Anwar.
The pair have had an acrimonious relationship over two decades sparked when Mahathir, during his previous tenure as prime minister, sacked Anwar as his deputy in 1998. A year later, Anwar was convicted of corruption and sodomy.
Anwar and his supporters maintain that all the charges were trumped up to end his political career.

Mahathir, now in his second stint as prime minister, has since publicly declared that he will step down in two years and make way for Anwar to become the country's eighth prime minister.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Protestors from across Germany marched through Berlin on Saturday against racism, xenophobia and the far right in one of the country's biggest rallies of recent years.
Organizers put the turnout at 242,000 people for the demonstration, which followed anti-immigration protests in several eastern cities over the summer and a rise in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party before a state election on Sunday.
A police spokesman declined to estimate the size of the crowd at the march, which was organized by a broad alliance of associations, labor unions, parties and rights groups including Amnesty International.
Marchers carried placards reading ""Build bridges not walls"", ""United against racism"" and ""We are indivisible - for an open and free society"". Some danced to pop music on a warm autumn day.
The arrival of more than a million migrants, many from war zones in the Middle East, has boosted support for the AfD. It is expected to fare well in the election in Bavaria, long a stronghold of the conservative Christian Social Union, a member of the Chancellor Angela Merkel's federal coalition government. 
In August, far-right groups in the eastern city of Chemnitz clashed with police and chased people they believed to be foreign after the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on two migrants. Similar protests took place in Dresden, Koethen and other eastern cities.
Merkel has accused AfD politicians of using the violent protests to stir up social tensions.
Nevertheless, the number of violent attacks on refugees and asylum shelters in Germany has fallen sharply in the first half of this year.

Two companies have also warned their German employees about the dangers of populism before the regional election in Bavaria while the head of the BDI industry association has said the economy could be hurt by a wave of nationalism.

In a column published in the Egyptian state newspaper al-Ahram ahead of a visit by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to Moscow next week, Lavrov praised what he described as a ""multifaceted partnership"" with Egypt. 
""It is important today to continue joint efforts that target supporting the safety of both countries' citizens, including aboard airplanes,"" Lavrov said in a commentary, published in Arabic.
Similar remarks appeared on the Russian news agency TASS.
Russia halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in October 2015 after Islamist militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight departing from the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board.
Since then Egypt has allowed Russian experts to inspect its airport security arrangements several times and the two countries have signed an agreement covering civil aviation security.
Flights between Moscow and Cairo resumed in April, but Egypt hopes to secure the return of Russian flights to its Red Sea resorts. 
The bombing and the Russian suspension were blows to Egypt's tourism industry, a key source of hard currency alongside remittances from Egyptians abroad and Suez Canal revenues.
The industry has been struggling after the upheaval triggered by a 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Sisi, who has met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times since he became president in 2014, is due to visit Russia on Wednesday.
Russia is a key trading partner for Egypt, which is a main regional U.S. ally and the most populous country in the Arab world.
Lavrov said relations between Russia and Egypt were strong, noting a $6.5 billion annual trade between the two countries. 

Russia last year signed an agreement with Egypt to build a nuclear power plant at Dabaa and another deal earlier this year to set up an industrial zone near the Suez Canal.

Human rights activists say Duterte's crackdown on drugs after taking office in June 2016 - since when the police have killed more than 4,800 people - made his government unfit for a seat at the body.
But the Philippines was re-elected to the 47-seat council by secret ballot at the U.N. General Assembly on Friday.

The Philippines garnered 165 out of 193 votes, with one abstention, to win a fresh term beginning Jan. 1, 2019, according to a U.N. statement on its website.
Duterte is the subject of two complaints before the International Criminal Court that accuse him of crimes against humanity over the drug-related killings. Human Rights Watch said ahead of the vote that the Philippines' ""egregious"" rights record made it unfit to be on the council.
One of Duterte's fiercest critics, Congressman Gary Alejano, described the Philippines' re-election to the body as a ""big irony"".
""A country that has numerous cases of human rights violations has no place in the Council,"" he said in a statement.
Duterte's government has denied that the police exterminate drug users, saying all those killed were dealers who had resisted arrest.

Last month, Duterte appeared to admit responsibility for extrajudicial killings, but his spokesman said the remarks had been ""playful"" and were misinterpreted.

Medical sources told Reuters the civilians died when the air strikes hit a Houthi checkpoint in the town of Jabal Rass while a bus was passing through. 
Eight members of the same family were among the victims, they said.
The Houthi movement’s Al Massira TV said 17 died and many others were in a critical condition. 
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment.
The coalition intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally-recognized government to power. It has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting the Iran-aligned Houthis, and has often hit civilians, but denies doing so intentionally.
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and driven the country - which was already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula - to the verge of widespread famine.

MINSK (Reuters) - The Russian Orthodox Church said on Saturday it would respond firmly to the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarchate over its decision to back Ukraine's request to establish an independent, or ""autocephalous"", Church.
Kiev sees the move, endorsed by a synod meeting in Istanbul on Thursday, as a vital step against Moscow's meddling in its affairs, but the Russian clergy fiercely opposes it as the biggest split in Christendom in 1,000 years.
Alexander Volkov, spokesman for Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, said the Holy Synod of the Church would ""express its position"", without elaborating on what measures it might take.
""The Synod, which will convene in Minsk (on Monday), will give its final assessment,"" Volkov told reporters.
""At any rate, the response will be in kind and tough,"" he added.
Last month the Russian Orthodox Church announced it would no longer participate in structures chaired by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, deepening the row over the Ukrainian Church's bid to break away from Moscow's orbit.
The long-running dispute has worsened since 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and gave support to pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Arriving in Minsk on Saturday, Patriarch Kirill, who has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters: ""I hope the Orthodox Church will find the strength to overcome hardships... to stay united.""

The Kiev Patriarchate's leader has been sharply critical of Putin and in 2014 suggested he was possessed by Satan.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has defrocked two Chilean bishops who have been caught up in the country's widening sexual abuse crisis, the Vatican said on Saturday.
The Vatican named the two men as Francisco José Cox Huneeus, archbishop emeritus of the city of La Serena, and Marco Antonio Órdenes Fernández, archbishop emeritus of Iquique.
A Vatican statement in Spanish said the pope's decision was definitive and not open to appeal. It referred to a part of Canon (Church) law related to the crime of sexual abuse of minors.
Defrocking, officially called ""reduced to the lay state"", means they have been expelled from the priesthood. It is the harshest punishment the Church can inflict on a member of the clergy and such action has rarely been taken against bishops.
Earlier this month, the religious order to which Cox belongs, the Schoenstatt Fathers, said the Vatican was investigating an accusation against him relating to the sexual abuse of a minor in Germany in 2004.
Cox, who is believed to have returned to Germany after a period in Chile, could not be reached for comment.
According to Chilean media, Órdenes, who resigned as bishop of Iquique in 2012 while under Vatican investigation, was accused of molesting a 17-year-old altar boy years ago.
He is believed to be living somewhere in Chile. It was not immediately possible to reach him for comment.

Last month Francis defrocked Father Fernando Karadima, an 88-year-old Chilean priest who sexually abused teenage boys over a period of many years and is at the center of a wider abuse scandal that is still being investigated.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban leaders will continue to meet for discussions with the newly appointed U.S. special envoy for peace efforts in Afghanistan, the Taliban said on Saturday, a move that could accelerate diplomatic engagement between the warring sides.
Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-born U.S. diplomat, met with Taliban leaders in Qatar on Friday in an effort to find a way to end the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan.
""Both sides spoke (about) an end to the occupation and a peaceful solution to the Afghan issue ... Both sides agreed to continue meeting in the future,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement. 
Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Saturday and briefed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani about his 10-day tour of four countries, which ended with the meeting with leaders of the hardline Islamist militant group.
A senior member of the Taliban said Khalilzad had asked the Taliban leadership, based in the Qatari capital Doha, to declare a ceasefire in Afghanistan during upcoming parliamentary polls.
""Both sides discuss prospects of peace and the U.S presence in Afghanistan,"" said another Taliban official, requesting anonymity.
In exchange, the Taliban wants the Afghan government to release its fighters from jails across the country and the swift removal of foreign forces fighting alongside Afghan soldiers. 
U.S. officials in Kabul were not immediately available to comment on Khalilzad's visit.
Khalilzad was appointed as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation last month, as President Donald Trump's administration launched fresh efforts to hold peace talks with the Taliban. 
A senior official working with the Afghan president said Khalilzad had briefed Ghani about his meetings with senior ministers and top diplomats in four countries who could play a key role in peace talks with the Taliban.
Khalilzad's trip started in Afghanistan and he traveled to Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar before returning to Kabul.
Western and Asian diplomats in Kabul said Khalilzad, 67, has knowledge of the country's main languages, culture and politics that could help him engage with all stakeholders in the peace process.
""The Trump administration and Ghani's government are now banking on Khalilzad to find a diplomatic way to end the war with the Taliban,"" said a top Western diplomat in Kabul.
Political analysts in Kabul said both sides will have to make concessions for the talks to succeed. 
But continued fighting has raised questions about the viability of the U.S. strategy to end the war, which for the past year has focused on forcing the militants to the negotiating table, largely via more air strikes.
Last week the Taliban demanded a complete withdrawal of foreign forces as the only solution to end the war that began with the 2001 ouster of the Taliban former government by U.S.-led forces after it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden following the 9/11 attacks on the United States.
They have ramped up attacks in strategic provinces and have also directed Afghans to boycott parliamentary elections scheduled for Oct. 20.

At least 8,050 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the first nine months of 2018, almost half of them targeted by suicide bomb attacks and other improvised devices that may amount to war crimes, the United Nations said last week.

The airport is a centerpiece of a 15-year construction boom under President Tayyip Erdogan. It has an initial planned capacity of 90 million passengers a year, making it one of the world's biggest.
Its official opening has been set for Oct. 29, the anniversary of the Turkish Republic's proclamation in 1923, but the general manager, Kadri Samsunlu, said it would only open partially on that date.
""We postponed the big transfer from Ataturk Airport to Dec. 31,"" Hurriyet Daily News quoted Samsunlu as telling a group of reporters visiting the new airport with him. Ataturk is the city's current main airport.
Samsunlu's company IGA, which will operate the new airport, said last month work there was on schedule and the planned Oct. 29 opening would not be delayed.
Hurriyet said that as of Oct. 29, Turkish Airlines will fly from the new airport to Ankara, Izmir and Antalya on domestic routes, with the only international route being to Baku, in Azerbaijan.
Last month Turkey formally detained dozens of people among hundreds involved in protests over work conditions at the new airport. Work subsequently resumed, with a heavy police presence, according to labor unions.
The company said steps had been taken to improve working conditions and living quarters, which workers say were infested with bedbugs.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. senators urge India to soften data localization stance,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators have called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to soften India's stance on data localization, warning that measures requiring it represent ""key trade barriers"" between the two nations.
In a letter to Modi dated Friday and seen by Reuters, U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Mark Warner - co-chairs of the Senate's India caucus that comprises over 30 senators - urged India to instead adopt a ""light touch"" regulatory framework that would allow data to flow freely across borders.
The letter comes as relations between Washington and New Delhi are strained over multiple issues, including an Indo-Russian defense contract, India's new tariffs on electronics and other items, and its moves to buy oil from Iran despite upcoming U.S. sanctions.
Global payments companies including Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) have been lobbying India's finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India to relax proposed rules that require all payment data on domestic transactions in India be stored inside the country by October 15. 
The letter is most likely a last-ditch effort after the RBI told officials at top payment firms this week that the central bank would implement, in full, its data localization directive without extending the deadline, or allowing data to be stored both offshore as well as locally - a practice known as data mirroring. 
""We see this (data localization) as a fundamental issue to the further development of digital trade and one that is crucial to our economic partnership,"" the U.S. senators said in the letter that has not been previously reported.
Modi's office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
LOCALIZATION PUSH
Other than the RBI proposal, India is working on an overarching data protection law that calls for storing all critical personal data in India. E-commerce and cloud computing policies are also being developed. 
The letter also raised concerns on the draft data protection bill and e-commerce policy framework that called for stringent localization measures. 
These measures have unnerved some tech companies who fear it will increase their infrastructure costs, hit their global fraud detection analytic platforms and affect planned investments in India at a time when more and more Indians are going online and using digital payments. 
U.S. lobby groups, that represent companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google, have also voiced concerns about the proposals.
Shamika Ravi, a member of Modi's economic advisory council, had earlier told Reuters that the moves were in the ""long-term strategic and economic interest"" of the country. 
The senators added that any concerns related to ""protection and security"" as well as access to data for lawful purposes were possible without restrictions on physical location, according to the letter.
Government sources have previously told Reuters though, that stringent data localization measures were essential for gaining easier access to data during investigations. 

The measures in India come at a time when countries around the world are announcing stringent rules to regulate how firms store data and protect privacy, in the aftermath of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's investigation into the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has revealed recordings made on his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch purportedly indicating he was tortured and killed, a Turkish newspaper reported on Saturday.
The report in the pro-government Sabah daily, which could not immediately be verified, emerged after a delegation from Saudi Arabia arrived in Turkey for a joint investigation into his disappearance.
""The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watch's memory,"" the paper said, adding that the watch had synched with his iPhone, which his fiancée was carrying outside the consulate.
Two senior Turkish officials previously told Reuters that Khashoggi had been wearing a black Apple watch when he entered the consulate and that it was connected to a mobile phone he left outside.
However, it was not clear whether data from Khashoggi’s watch could have been transmitted to his phone outside, or how investigators could have retrieved it without obtaining the watch themselves.
Technology experts say it is highly unlikely the watch could have recorded actions inside the embassy and uploaded them to an iCloud account. Most models of the watch require that it be within 30 to 50 feet (9-15 meters) of the iPhone that it is paired with to upload data to Apple’s iCloud, they said.
Even newer models that can communicate with the cloud directly via wireless require either connection to a nearby WiFi network or a type of cellular connection that is not available in Turkey, the experts say.
RECORDINGS
Sabah, which cited ""reliable sources in a special intelligence department"" for its report, said Khashoggi was believed to have turned on the recording feature on the watch before entering the consulate.
The paper said Saudi intelligence agents had realized after he died that the watch was recording and they used his finger print to unlock it, deleting some files, but not all of them. The recordings were subsequently found on his phone, it said.
On Thursday, Turkey said it and Saudi Arabia had agreed to form a joint working group - at Riyadh's initiative - to investigate the case. A Saudi source said a senior royal, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, had visited Turkey that day.
Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but Turkish officials and his fiancée, who was waiting outside, said he never came out.
Turkish sources have told Reuters the initial assessment of the police was that Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the Saudi government, had been deliberately killed inside the consulate. Riyadh has dismissed the claims.
SPA said on Friday that Saudi Arabia's interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif, condemned the ""lies and baseless allegations"" against the kingdom, although he praised the joint investigation with Turkey.
The Saudi delegation, which arrived in Turkey on Thursday, is meeting a Turkish prosecutor investigating the case as well as representatives from the Justice Ministry, Interior Ministry, police and the national intelligence agency, one source said.

On Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry said the Saudi consulate in Istanbul would be searched as part of the investigation.

BELFAST (Reuters) - The head of the Northern Irish party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May's government said on Saturday she would prefer no Brexit deal to a bad deal, describing current plans as amounting to ""the annexation of Northern Ireland"" by the EU.
British and European Union negotiators this month have accelerated the push for a Brexit deal but talks remain snagged on the issue of the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Irish Republic, an EU member state.
In the absence of a comprehensive EU-UK trade partnership after Brexit, the EU is seeking a ""backstop"" arrangement whereby Northern Ireland would effectively remain subject to the bloc's regulations to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
But the DUP, whose support May needs to pass legislation in the British parliament, vehemently opposes any proposals under which the province would be treated differently to the rest of the UK.
""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' (Brexit) but the dangers of a bad deal are worse,"" Foster wrote in an article in the Belfast Telegraph published on Saturday.
""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules made in a place where we have no say,"" she added. 
Britain wants any 'backstop' arrangement to be time-limited. Hardline supporters of Brexit in May's ruling Conservative Party fear it could be used to keep the whole UK inside a customs union indefinitely with the EU.
The EU is opposed to any specific cut-off date.
""NO GAME""
Foster said her party, which has 10 lawmakers in the UK parliament, was not bluffing in its tough stance on the talks. 
""This is no game. Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks,"" Foster said.
""The coming days, weeks and months will be critical. The decisions taken will shape the type of Northern Ireland that our grandchildren will live in.""
Foster said she wanted to secure a deal that would work for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and said she would travel to Dublin for talks on Monday.
In an article in another Northern Ireland newspaper, the Belfast News Letter, former British foreign minister Boris Johnson also took aim at the backstop, describing May's agreement to accept a backstop as a ""dreadful mistake"".

""The only way to put things back on the right track is to ditch the backstop...,"" Johnson wrote.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Australia to urgently evacuate detainees from the Pacific islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, saying it bears responsibility for their deteriorating health conditions.
Worsening mental health has left some of the children among the refugees in a ""semi-comatose state"", unable to eat, drink or talk, humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which was ejected from Nauru, has said.
The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Friday that more than 1,400 people are still being held on both islands, which have hosted Australia-bound migrants and asylum-seekers since 2013. 
The refugees were transferred to the islands after being intercepted trying to reach Australia by boat, a policy widely criticized by the United Nations and other rights groups.
""This policy has failed on a number of measures,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Catherine Stubberfield said in a statement. ""It's failed to protect refugees, it's failed to provide even for their most basic needs.""
Of the 12 people who have died since Australia began detaining migrants and refugees offshore, half had been confirmed or suspected suicides, the agency said. 
""Ultimately, responsibility lies with Australia for those who have sought its protection,"" Stubberfield said in the statement on the agency's website.
""This is a system designed, financed, managed by Australia, and it's Australia which must be accountable for the full gamut of those consequences.""
Australia's Department of Home Affairs did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to seek comment.
In a statement to the Guardian newspaper, it said it treated the health of refugees ""seriously"".
It added, ""All transferees on Nauru are free to move around the island; they are not in detention.""
A contracted provider offered services such as general practitioners, nursing and mental healthcare clinics throughout the week, in addition to after-hours staffing for emergencies, it said in the statement.
As many as 65 health professionals, including 33 mental health professionals, provide services to transferees on Nauru, it added.

The tourist paradise has been in political upheaval since February, when a state of emergency was imposed by Yameen, who ran the Indian Ocean islands with an iron hand, critics say, jailing political opponents and Supreme Court justices.
Since Yameen lost his bid for re-election, the opposition has been trying to secure a smooth transition of power, due on Nov. 17.
Four members of the Maldives Elections Commission have fled and three are in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, leaving behind just one panel member, two of the Maldivian officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
""We left due to threats,"" said one, who asked not be identified, for fear of a risk to his life.
Yameen's party dismissed the threat accusations, saying the election officials left because of public outrage sparked by the leak of an audio recording about poll rigging.
""So they say,"" Mohamed Hussain Shareef, secretary general of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), told Reuters. ""When in fact they left because of public outrage following a leaked audio about rigging. They are refusing to clarify.""
The officials' accusations follow domestic media reports of a complaint to police by the company that printed the ballots, saying the PPM sought to bribe its employees to provide false statements that backed Yameen's challenge.
Yameen's party called the complaint ""ludicrous"", saying it was a tactic to divert attention from the court case.
Yameen conceded defeat in last month's election after an official count showed joint opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had polled 16.8 percent more votes in a surprise result.
The Election Commission said the vote had been free and fair, with turnout of 89.2 percent.
But on Wednesday, his lawyers approached the Supreme Court, saying supporters had complained about rigging of votes and fraudulent ballot papers.
With its location near key shipping lanes, the Maldives has become important as China and India compete for regional influence.
China is building up the islands' infrastructure in its Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia.

CGN and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) are jointly promoting an advanced third-generation reactor known as the Hualong One to overseas clients. CGN aims to deploy the technology at a proposed nuclear project at Bradwell in England. 
On Thursday, amid growing trade tensions, the U.S. Department of Energy said it was tightening controls on exports to China of civil nuclear technology to prevent use for military or other unauthorized purposes.
CGN said in a statement on Saturday the project in England did not use American technology.
""We will continue to push forward with the new nuclear power project in England with our partners,"" it said.
CGN came under scrutiny anew in the United States last year with a National Security Council-led review of China's efforts to obtain nuclear material, equipment and advanced technology from U.S. companies, U.S. government officials told reporters on Thursday.
The review was prompted by China's accelerated efforts to acquire U.S. intellectual property to the detriment of U.S. businesses and military interests, they said.
The officials said the indictment in 2016 of a Chinese-American nuclear engineer, Allen Ho, was one of the factors that led to the review.
Ho, a naturalized U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to produce ""special nuclear material"" in China in violation of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act. CGN was also charged.
The United States and China signed an agreement on nuclear cooperation in late 2006 to build four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors and also transfer key technology to China. After years of delays, the debut AP1000 was connected to the Chinese grid earlier this year.

Australia has taken delivery of nine F-35 jet fighters and has committed to buy 72, with all aircraft expected to be fully operational by 2023. The nine planes remain grounded at a training base in Arizona.

""Australian F-35 aircraft currently based in the United States will return to flying operations once safety inspections are complete,"" the ADF said.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A group of five South Korean climbers and four Nepali climbers and porters has been reported missing after a storm hit a camp on a Himalayan peak in west Nepal, officials said on Saturday.
Tourism Ministry official Rameshwar Niraula said the storm struck the group at the base camp of Mount Gurja, a mountain of 7,913 meters (25,961 feet), on Saturday. The official said the camp had been destroyed.
Wangchu Sherpa, head of the Trekking Camp Nepal agency that provided local support to the South Korean team, said the camp had been devastated, citing the pilot of a rescue helicopter that was sent to look for the missing group on Saturday morning.
Niraula didn't disclose the names of the missing climbers and porters and gave no further details of the incident, which involves the largest group to be hit by a climbing accident in Nepal in two years.
The area lies about 216 km (130 miles) northwest of Kathmandu in the region where the world's seventh-highest mountain, Dhaulagiri, is located.
Wangchu Sherpa, of the Trekking Camp Nepal agency, said the rescue helicopter sent to look for the climbers could not land due to poor visibility.
""Our rescue operation is continuing and we are trying to find details,"" he told Reuters, without identifying the missing.
Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, and the autumn climbing season is now at its peak. Income from foreign climbers is a major source of revenue for the cash-strapped nation.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia aims to ban private or religious schools from expelling students on the basis of their sexuality, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday. 
Debate over personal rights is growing ahead of a crucial by-election for Morrison's ruling Liberal-National coalition in the blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Wentworth on Oct. 20.
""I will be taking action to ensure amendments are introduced as soon as practicable to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality,"" Morrison said in a statement.
The statement, which urged parliament to tackle the issue over the next two weeks, follows an offer of support by the largest opposition party, Labour, to repeal legal exemptions that allow religious schools to discriminate.
Archbishop Mark Coleridge, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, called this week for equality in school employment and enrolment.
""Once employed or enrolled, people within a Catholic school community are expected to adhere to the school's mission and values,"" the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper quoted him as saying.
Australia's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage in December after a nationwide postal survey returned an overwhelming majority in favor of the unions. 
Morrison said the government was working through its responses to the recommendations of a review panel to examine if the change to the law had restricted religious freedom. The recommendations have not been publicly disclosed.

""Our government does not support expulsion of students from religious non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality,"" he added.

TORNILLO, Texas (Reuters) - A tent city in the west Texas desert set up to hold immigrant children has expanded its capacity by nearly 10 times to 3,800 beds since it opened in June, officials said on Friday.
The facility in the border city of Tornillo sprang up with 400 beds when the Trump administration put into place its ""zero tolerance"" policy that called for separating parents from children after families crossed the border from Mexico illegally. 
While officials say Tornillo no longer holds minors separated under ""zero tolerance,"" after the administration rolled back that policy following a public outcry and under pressure from U.S. courts, the facility has grown. It now includes children who crossed the U.S. border on their own. 
Tornillo houses 1,465 children between the ages of 13 and 17, of whom nearly 900 were detained coming from Guatemala, officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services said during a camp tour.
""No children that were a part of the family separations are at the Tornillo facility,"" the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.
Federal officials would not let reporters on the tour interview children and has tightly controlled access to the tent city in Tornillo, a town of about 1,600 people some 30 miles (50 km) southeast of El Paso.
Since it opened, the camp, with air-conditioned tents, has enhanced its amenities to include access to legal services for the children, medical care, soccer, televised sports events and religious services, U.S. officials said.
The average stay of a child at Tornillo is 29 days before the child is released to a sponsor, according to Health and Human Services. 
Civil rights groups have said that no matter what amenities are offered, holding children in a detention facility for prolonged periods can be a human rights violation.
Trump administration officials have said the zero tolerance policy, under which some 2,600 children were separated from their parents, was needed to secure the border and deter illegal immigration.
President Donald Trump was forced to end the policy after public furor over the separations and the chaotic way in which they were conducted, with hundreds of parents deported without their children.
According to a court filing by the government in late September, 136 children separated under the ""zero tolerance"" policy remain in government custody.

A Saudi source also said a senior royal, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, visited Turkey on Thursday for talks. Later the same day Turkey said the two countries had agreed to form a joint working group - at Riyadh's initiative - to investigate the case.
Saudi state news agency SPA later quoted a Saudi official as welcoming Turkey's approval of its request to form the team.
U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in Ohio, said he had not yet spoken to Saudi Arabia's King Salman about Khashoggi's disappearance but would be calling him ""pretty soon.""
""This is a very serious thing and we're looking at it in a very serious manner,"" Trump said.
Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but Turkish officials and his fiancee, who was waiting outside, said he never came out.
Turkish sources have told Reuters the initial assessment of the police was that Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the Saudi government, was deliberately killed inside the consulate. 
Riyadh has dismissed the claims.
SPA said on Friday that Saudi Arabia's interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif, condemned the ""lies and baseless allegations"" against the kingdom, although he praised the joint investigation with Turkey.
The Saudi delegation, which arrived in Turkey on Thursday, is meeting a Turkish prosecutor investigating the case as well as representatives from the Justice Ministry, Interior Ministry, police and the national intelligence agency, one source said. 
There is no set date for how long the meetings will take, but ""very quick results need to be seen"", the source said. The team is now in Istanbul and will continue to work over the weekend, the source added.
Prince Khaled, the governor of Mecca, made his brief visit in his capacity as special adviser to King Salman, a source with links to the prince's family told Reuters, in a move that would suggest the monarch was treating the issue as a priority.
President Tayyip Erdogan has previously said that Turkey could not remain silent over Khashoggi's disappearance and called on officials at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to prove he had left the building.

On Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry said the Saudi consulate in Istanbul would be searched as part of the investigation.

The Journal, citing a person familiar with the gathering, said U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad met with Taliban officials in Doha, the second time in four months that American officials have held face-to-face talks with Taliban representatives.
The Journal said it was not clear what the two sides discussed. Khalilzad, who is trying to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, is currently on his first trip as the special representative. His 11-day trip was to take him to Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
The State Department declined to say whether the meeting with Taliban officials in Doha took place.
""We can't confirm specific meetings or the content of diplomatic conversations,"" said a State Department spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Special Representative Khalilzad held a number of meetings with a wide range of stakeholders as part of his trip to explore how best to reach a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Afghanistan,"" the spokesperson added.
Alice Wells, the State Department deputy assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, met Taliban officials in Doha in July for what were described as talks about talks. A Taliban official who was part of the four-person delegation to that meeting said it produced ""very positive signals.""
A U.S.-led coalition forced the Taliban from power in 2001 in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 al Qaeda attacks on Washington and New York. Taliban officials want the withdrawal of American forces and a government in Kabul that reflects the group's view of Islam.

Speaking in a radio interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show recorded on Thursday and aired on Friday, Bolton said President Donald Trump believed China had taken advantage of the international order for far too long and not enough Americans had stood up to it.
""Now's the time to do it"" he said.
Bolton said Trump's tough approach towards China, a country the administration saw as the ""major issue this century,"" had left Beijing ""confused.""
""They've never seen an American president this tough before. I think their behavior needs to be adjusted in the trade area, in the international, military and political areas, in a whole range of areas,"" he said.
""Perhaps we'll see at the G20 meeting in Argentina next month Xi Jinping willing to come to talk turkey on some of these issues,"" he added.
Bolton's remarks came amid a series of administration broadsides against China that goes beyond a trade war. These have included accusing Beijing of trying to undermine Trump ahead of next month's congressional elections and of taking reckless military actions in the South China Sea.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday Trump would go through with plans to meet Xi at the G20 summit if it looked possible to chart ""a positive direction."" But he said re-launching trade talks with China would require Beijing to commit to taking action on structural reforms to its economy.
Bolton called recent Chinese behavior in the South China Sea, where a U.S. warship had a near collision with a Chinese vessel last month, ""dangerous"" and said the United States was determined to keep international sea lanes open.
""This is something the Chinese need to understand,"" he said, adding that allies including Britain and Australia were also sailing through the South China Sea to make this point.
""We're going to do a lot more on that,"" he said.
""I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the South China Sea with or without Chinese cooperation. They need to know they have not achieved a fait accompli here. This is not a Chinese province and will not be.""
Bolton did not elaborate on his remark about mineral exploitation in the strategic waterway, which China claims almost in its entirety in spite of several rival claimants.
Bolton said China's violation of international norms in trade and business had allowed it to gain substantial economic and military strength.
""If they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology, their military capabilities would be substantially reduced. And a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced,"" Bolton said.
He indicated that Washington was prepared to take more action to restrict sensitive high-tech exports to China.
""We did this and continue to do it in terms of dual-use technology that could affect nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or ballistic-missile development. 
""I think in cyberspace, we're entitled to do the same thing ... We want to do it in ways that protect our open economy, but deny others the ability to take advantage of it.""
Bolton said he expected a second summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""sometime in the next couple of months,"" but said it remained to be seen if the diplomatic effort to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons would be successful.
""The president has held the door open for North Korea,"" he said. ""They need to denuclearize completely and irreversibly. And if they do that and walk through the door, the future could be very different for the North Korean people.

""The future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy. He's optimistic. He presses hard. He does not have stars in his eyes about this. Neither does Mike Pompeo, neither does Jim Mattis, neither do I,"" Bolton said, referring to the U.S. secretaries of defense and state.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israel, Syria and the United Nations have agreed to open the Quneitra crossing in the Golan Heights on Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday.
Haley said in a statement that the opening ""will allow U.N. peacekeepers to step up their efforts to prevent hostilities in the Golan Heights region.""
The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has been monitoring operations in a demilitarized zone established in 1974 between the Israeli-occupied Golan and the Syrian sector, but the peacekeeping mission was disrupted by Syria's civil war.
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war and fought Syria again on the strategic plateau in a 1973 conflict.
""We look to both Israel and Syria to provide U.N. peacekeepers the access they need as well as assurances of their safety. We also call on Syria to take the necessary steps so UNDOF can safely and effectively deploy and patrol without interference,"" Haley said.
Military police from Russia, a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, have been patrolling on the Syrian side of Quneitra. 

Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited the Israeli side of the crossing on Sept. 27. He said then that in the past, traffic through Quneitra mainly comprised shipments into Syria of apples grown by Druze farmers on the Israeli-controlled Golan - and the entry of brides for partners on both sides of the armistice line.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","Israel says Palestinian refugees number in the thousands, not millions","By Dan Williams
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli government study shared with Washington argues that Palestinian refugees number in the thousands, not the millions designated by a U.N. aid agency whose funding has been slashed by the Trump administration, an Israeli official said on Friday. 
The fate of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 war of Israel's founding and their descendants has long clouded U.S.-sponsored peace efforts. Frustration over the issue is among factors fuelling often violent weekly protests at the Gaza border over the last half year, during which around 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. 
Palestinians demand a refugee right of return to lands now in Israel, which rejects this, insisting they settle where they are or in a future Palestinian state. Negotiations on founding that state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza stalled in 2014.
Demographics loom over the dispute. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees puts their number at some 5 million, a tally including descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled in 1948. 
Israel says only survivors among the original 1948 refugees should be considered refugees today - an idea fiercely opposed by the Palestinian leadership, which hews to the UNRWA numbers. 
The Israeli study has not been published and there was no immediate reaction from Palestinian officials or from UNRWA on its numbers.
Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's deputy foreign minister, described 2018 as a ""turning-point"" for UNRWA and its definition of Palestinian refugees, ""in that the United States has said 'no more' and the State of Israel is closing rank with this policy"".
TALLY
Speaking to Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM, Hotovely said researchers in her ministry and in Israel's National Security Council had compiled a report determining that there were ""a limited number of thousands"" of Palestinian refugees today.
""It does not come close to millions,"" she said, without elaborating on how Israel's researchers had calculated those lower figures. 
Asked to respond to Hotovely's remarks, a U.S. official who requested anonymity told Reuters: ""While the United States believes the UNRWA model is not appropriate or sustainable, we will not elaborate further at this time.""
In August, the then U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said UNRWA should ""change the number of refugees to an accurate account"" in return for a restoration of U.S. funding for the agency. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton lambasted UNRWA's aid program as ""the only one in history based on the assumption that refugee status is hereditary"".

In an open letter issued the following month, UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl said “the protracted nature of the Palestine refugee crisis” was not unique. He said the children and grandchildren of long-displaced refugees in Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Congo and elsewhere are also recognized as refugees and assisted by the United Nations.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The body that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature has asked the wife of the man at the centre of a rape scandal to resign from the Swedish Academy as it tries to rebuild its reputation, a member said on Friday.
This year's prize-giving was postponed after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against Jean-Claude Arnault, husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson, and the academy's discovery that the names of some prize-winners had been leaked prompted several members to resign or withdraw from work.
Arnault was sentenced this month to two years in prison for rape. He denied all accusations and is appealing the verdict.
Last month, the head of the Nobel Foundation told Reuters it could stop the academy awarding the literature prize if it did not make further changes in the wake of the scandal. 
""The academy has unanimously agreed to a resolution begging (Frostenson) to voluntarily withdraw from the academy,"" its Permanent Secretary Anders Olsson told Reuters on Friday.
""If this should not occur, we will start a new, impartial investigation of Frostenson's alleged transgressions of our statues, giving her a fair chance to defend her cause ... This is the second part of the resolution,"" he said.
Olsson said the academy's previous investigation had been unsatisfactory and had several shortcomings, including that Frostenson was never part of the inquiry and that the results had been evaluated too ""hastily"".
Swedish media have alleged that Frostenson leaked the names of literature prize winners - the subject of heavy betting - to Arnault before they were announced.
Some members also accused Frostenson of shielding Arnault.
Frostenson has not commented publicly and did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
There have been previous calls for Frostenson, who has been refraining from participating in academy tasks, to resign, but she has not indicated any intention to do so.
Olsson said that if Frostenson did not resign, the next inquiry would primarily focus on a stricter application of Nobel rules that require winner's names to be kept secret before they are formally announced.
""Since Arnault has abused information for his own benefit about candidates for the prize, Frostenson is according to the new radical interpretation of (Swedish Academy) statutes responsible for his actions as if she committed them herself,"" said Olsson.

Last week, the academy named two new members.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia vowed on Friday to defend Russian church believers in Ukraine from any illegal activity against them following Kiev's moves toward a historic split from the Russian Orthodox Church.
Ukraine wants to establish a national church, free from its traditional ties to Russia, which it says is a vital step to tackling Russian meddling in its affairs. Moscow opposes the move, arguing it would cause a schism in Orthodox Christianity.
The Kremlin's comments could inflame tensions between Kiev and Moscow, whose relations collapsed following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of a Moscow-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. 
Critics of Ukraine's plan for an independent church say it could lead to violence and forced takeovers of churches loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church. 
President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov laid out the Kremlin's stand.
""In the event that the events which are developing take the course of illegal activities, then of course, just as Russia defends the interests of Russians and Russian speakers - and Putin has spoken about this many times – Russia will defend the interests of the Orthodox,"" he told reporters. ""This is an absolutely grounded and absolutely understandable position.""
Peskov said the defense would consist exclusively of political and diplomatic measures. However, to Kiev his comments were uncomfortably close to the language used in the run-up to the Crimean annexation and the separatist rebellion.
""We have heard similar messages on the 'protection of the Russian-speaking population' from the Russian Federation as justification for its aggression against Ukraine,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mariana Betsa tweeted.
Ukraine secured approval on Thursday from a synod in Istanbul, seat of the global spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, to establish what is known as an ""autocephalous"", or independent, church.
Late on Friday, Putin discussed the decision with members of the Russian national security council, the Kremlin said in a statement.
The next step is for Ukraine to reunite its various strands of Orthodox faith in that new church, which includes deciding the fate of church buildings and monasteries, some of which are aligned to the Russian Orthodox Church. 
""I urge against provocations and speculation,"" Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov wrote on Twitter. 

""The Ministry of Internal Affairs will ensure security and law and order. If there is a need to prevent extremism and religious hatred, it (the ministry) will act rigidly - and let it not come as an unexpected surprise for the 'hotheads'!""

GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians on Friday in protests along Gaza's border, Gaza health officials said. Israel said its troops had shot a group who broke through the fence with a bomb and attacked an army post.
The Palestinian deaths bring to around 200 the number of Gazans killed since the border protests began on March 30, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.
Gaza medics said that, in addition to the seven dead, around 140 others were wounded.
The Israeli military said that the demonstrators, numbering around 15,000, had been ""hurling rocks, explosive devices, firebombs and grenades"" at Israeli troops and at the fence.
Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col Jonathan Conricus tweeted that one group had ""detonated a bomb on the Israel-Gaza border fence"", allowing around 20 people to climb through the hole. 
He said around five of the group had then launched an organised attack against a military post inside Israel and all had been killed by the troops.
The Palestinian protesters are demanding an end to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the narrow coastal strip, which is home to around 2 million Gazans. They also seek the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel's founding in 1948.
Israel accuses the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, of orchestrating the protests along the border fence to provide cover for attacks and to distract from Gaza’s economic plight. Hamas denies the allegations.
The Israeli military has been criticised by Palestinians and international human rights groups for its lethal response to the protests. It says its troops have used ""riot dispersal means"" and have fired ""in accordance with standard operating procedures"". 
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper during the weekly protests, and tracts of Israeli land have been scorched by incendiary kites and balloons.
Hamas seized control of Gaza from Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 and has since fought three wars with Israel, most recently in 2014. 

Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a conference in Istanbul from Gaza, said on Friday that Hamas was seeking to reach understandings with several parties, including Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations. He expressed hope that the efforts ""could lead to calm in return for breaking the siege"".

UNICEF spokesman Christophe Boulierac said the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) was formed in 2013 by vigilante groups in Borno state to fight Boko Haram which itself gained international notoriety for kidnapping schoolgirls in the town of Chibok.
The CJTF signed an action plan in September 2017 to end child recruitment, and the release of the children, 40 percent of whom were 15 or younger, was its first formal release. 
""This is a significant milestone in ending the recruitment and use of children, but many more children remain in the ranks of other armed groups in either combat or support roles,"" UNICEF Nigeria Deputy Representative Pernille Ironside said in a statement.
The released children were among 1,175 boys and 294 girls who had been identified as being associated with the CJTF in the city of Maiduguri, UNICEF said, although the total has yet to be verified and could include another 2,200 or more children.
It said that it had supported the social and economic reintegration of more than 8,700 children released from armed groups since 2017, helping trace their families, returning them to their communities and offering them psycho-social support, education, vocational training and informal apprenticeships.
Boulierac said that the CJTF included children who were ""pursuing military objectives"" but also many in support roles, so their reintegration into society might be easier than those released from an armed group like Boko Haram.
That Islamist group has kidnapped thousands since it began an insurgency in 2009 aimed at creating an Islamic state in the northeast. 
""As far as the Nigerian government is concerned, the CJTF is a local intelligence gathering group. The defense ministry does not have any evidence of armed soldiers who are under age,"" said presidency spokesman Garba Shehu, who spoke on the phone. 
Nigeria's government has said since December 2015 that Boko Haram has been ""technically defeated"", 20 months after the kidnap of the 270 Chibok girls.

Yet attacks continue in the northeast, while Islamic State West Africa, which splintered off from Boko Haram in 2016, holds territory around Lake Chad.

Prime Minister Antonio Costa accepted the resignation after having firmly defended his minister during a parliament debate on Wednesday where he said he had his trust and should remain in office. Azeredo Lopes denied any wrongdoing.
Opposition leaders had repeatedly called for his ouster.
Local media reported earlier this month that one of the suspects had told investigators that the minister was aware of an alleged staged operation to recover the weapons last October, which Azeredo Lopes categorically denied on various occasions, including in his resignation letter on Friday.
The minister said in the letter that he was stepping down to protect the armed forces from a political attack against him. He previously called the suspected involvement of the military in the cover-up ""an embarrassment"". 
The theft of grenades, anti-tank rockets, other explosives and ammunition from a military arms depot was discovered in June 2017 and caused a furor in Portugal. Questions arose about security at the armed forces bases of the NATO member country.
Prosecutors initially said they suspected international arms traffickers and terrorist groups of having stolen the weapons and taken them out of the country, but military police recovered the weapons last October.

The recovery, without any arrests or named suspects, triggered an investigation by prosecutors, who last month ordered the arrest of the head of the military police and several army officers.

GURGAON, India (Reuters) - Indian Hindu hardliners are forcing meat sellers to shut shops in a New Delhi suburb that is home to global outsourcing firms, saying they must respect the feelings of majority Hindus celebrating a nine-day festival.
The drive against the mostly Muslim shopkeepers in Gurgaon during the Navaratri festival is the highest profile campaign since Hindu vigilantes targeted people engaged in the slaughter of cows, considered sacred to Hindus.
With a national election due by May, some states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government are drawing accusations that they are not doing enough to curb the activities of Hindu hardliners.
One meat shopkeeper referred to the 1947 division of British India into the independent India and Pakistan.
""This is the first time since partition that we have been asked to close shops for this long a period,"" said Sajid Qureshi, whose family has been selling meat for decades. 
Men are roaming around on motorbikes and surveying areas to check for shops selling meat, said Rajeev Mittal, head of Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, an umbrella organization of 22 Hindu groups.
""Goats, cows are cut and hung up for all to see by the road. So we don't want people who are fasting during the Navratri to see this,"" said Mittal, who was wearing a red religious mark on his forehead and a saffron shawl around his neck, told Reuters at his office.
Police detained six people in the region on Wednesday after confrontation which turned violent when Hindu groups allegedly forced a meat shop owner to close.
""Any one found forcibly closing meat shops will be dealt with sternly. The municipal corporation will do its enforcement on shops found running without a licence,"" said Vinay Pratap Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon.
Qureshi, who was sitting with his friends outside a closed meat shop near a mosque, said they had agreed to the demands of the Hindu groups as they wanted to avoid confrontations. 
Four other meat retailers told Reuters they were suffering heavy losses but were scared to keep their shops open, adding that it looked unlikely that they would be allowed to reopen for another week.
Hindu groups argue that they are asking meat shop owners with proper licenses to close only during the nine-day period, but want shops without licenses to be permanently shut down.
There are 95 licensed meat shops in the region, while there could be up to 60 without licenses, according to Ashish Singla, medical officer at Gurgaon's municipal corporation.

Gurgaon, about 30 km (18 miles) south of Delhi, is home to industrial plants including top automaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and many global outsourcing firms.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - One of India's most prominent environmental activists has died at the age of 86 after more than 15 weeks of a hunger strike to protest against government inaction on cleaning up the Ganges.
The death of G.D. Agarwal, who held a PhD in environmental engineering from the University of California in Berkeley, prompted an outpouring of grief and tributes from activists.
""His demise has shut one of the leading voices of criticism of the government on the Ganga pollution,"" said environmentalist Rakesh Jaiswal. ""He was one of the most important figures in this fight.""
The Ganges, worshipped by Hindus, is India's largest river system and one of its most polluted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 with a pledge to clean up the 1,570-mile-long river, used for water by 400 million people, but increasingly choked with domestic and industrial waste. 
A flagship five-year project he launched in 2015 has fallen flat, critics say. Results of a federal audit released in Dec. 2017 revealed lapses in planning and financial management of the scheme and said under a quarter of the funds for the program had been spent in two years.
Agarwal began his fast on June 22 in the northern Haridwar city, demanding a law to protect the river and the scrapping of construction of hydroelectric projects along its banks that have destroyed its natural flow. 
In a letter to Modi in August, he threatened to fast unto death unless action was taken. 
Modi said on Twitter he was ""saddened"" by Agarwal's death. ""His passion toward learning, education, saving the environment, particularly Ganga cleaning, will always be remembered. My condolences.""
India's opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi also paid tribute. ""To save the Ganga is to save the country. We will take his fight forward,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Ravi Kant, director of the AIIMS hospital in the northern city of Hrishikesh, on the banks of the Ganges, said Agarwal died of a cardiac arrest on Thursday.
He had been forcibly taken to the hospital by police a day before, hours after he stopped drinking water. Television footage showed Agarwal, clad in a saffron robe, being picked up by police officers along with the chair he was sitting on, as he kicked his legs in protest. 
Some activists on Friday demanded an independent investigation into Agarwal's death. 
""I don’t think the government made any honest effort to fulfill his demands,"" said Ravi Chopra, an environmentalist.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Rocket failure astronauts will go back into space - Russian official,"By Andrew Osborn and Maria Kiselyova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two astronauts who survived the mid-air failure of a Russian rocket will fly again and are provisionally set to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) in spring of next year, the head of Russia's space agency said on Friday. 
Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, was speaking a day after Russian cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin and American Nick Hague made a dramatic emergency landing in Kazakhstan after the failure of the Soyuz rocket carrying them to the orbital ISS.
Thursday's accident was the first serious launch problem experienced by a manned Soyuz space mission since 1983, when a crew narrowly escaped before a launch pad explosion. 
Russia is now under pressure to prove its space program is safe and received a boost on Friday when NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said he had full confidence in Russian-made Soyuz rockets and expected U.S. astronauts to fly on them again.
Bridenstine, speaking to reporters in Moscow, also said he was confident that a planned Soyuz launch in December, which is due to transport three people, including one American, to the $100 billion orbital research laboratory, would happen. 
Still, Moscow has suspended all manned space launches until it confirms exactly what went wrong and why, and Rogozin has ordered a state commission to investigate. Russian investigators have also opened a criminal investigation.
Sergei Krikalev, a senior Roscosmos official, said on Friday that Russia may also delay a planned unmanned cargo shipment by a Progress spacecraft to the ISS. Unmanned cargo launches carry food and other supplies to the ISS and use the same rocket system as the Soyuz. Russia says there is enough food on board to last until April.
Three people are now aboard the space station: a German, a Russian and an American. They were due to return to Earth in December, but may now be stuck there longer. 
VALVE FAILURE
Roscosmos chief Rogozin on Friday posted a picture on Twitter of himself seated next to the two astronauts involved in Thursday's accident, saying they had arrived in Moscow. Both men escaped unscathed and feel fine, Roscosmos and NASA have said.
Rogozin said both would fly into space again, probably in the spring. NASA's Bridenstine said Hague, the U.S. astronaut, had told him he wanted to fly again and that NASA had huge confidence in him but that he didn't know when he might fly. 
Thursday's mishap occurred as the first and second stages of the Russian rocket separated shortly after the launch from Kazakhstan's Soviet-era Baikonur cosmodrome.
The Interfax news agency on Friday cited a source familiar with the Russian investigation as saying that an important valve had failed to open due to a faulty firing cartridge. That in turn had hindered the separation of the first stage of the rocket from its second stage. 
NASA has relied on Russian rockets to ferry astronauts to the space station since the United States retired its Space Shuttle program in 2011. The agency is waiting for the tests early next year of two commercial rockets, by SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""I think that by the middle of next year we'll be flying crews on those rockets,"" said Bridenstine. 
NASA's top official said it was unlikely the Russian rocket failure would speed up development of those rockets because work on them was already flat out, but said it underlined the need for the world to have more than one way of getting to the ISS.
""I think this demonstrates how important it is ... not be dependent on one system or another system. This is an inflection point,"" he said. 
Space is an area of cooperation between the United States and Russia at a time of fraught relations. Bridenstine told reporters he didn't expect political differences to impinge.
""To keep space separate from the political environment has been our tradition and we want to keep that,"" said Bridenstine.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's president on Friday reluctantly signed off a judicial reform, including a reduction in his own powers, that he called a ""setback for Romanian democracy"".
Klaus Iohannis had, together with opposition parties, tried to block the measure which, among other things, removes his right to veto new chief prosecutor appointments, just as the government replaces a sacked anti-corruption prosecutor.
The Constitutional Court last month found the measure put forward by the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) to be in line with the constitution, leaving Iohannis, a centrist, no alternative but to sign it into law.
The law broadly gives more powers to the justice minister, a political appointee, to the detriment of the president and a magistrates' regulatory body.
The European Union, which has kept Romania's justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc a decade ago, fears the measure will reverse progress in fighting high-level graft by exposing judges to political interference.
""This change represents a setback for Romanian democracy, a danger signaled by our European partners,"" Iohannis said in a statement.
Romania is one of Europe's most corrupt countries, and tens of thousands of Romanians protesting against corruption have taken to the streets several times since the Social Democrats took power in early 2017 and tried to decriminalize several graft offences - most recently in August.
Before her sacking in July, chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta-Kovesi had secured a spate of convictions against lawmakers, ministers and mayors, exposing conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and the awarding of state contracts in exchange for bribes.
Justice Minister Tudorel Toader, who fired Codruta-Kovesi for exceeding her authority, has nominated little-known magistrate Adina Florea to replace her.
Speaking before a judicial advisory panel on Monday in her confirmation process, Florea said cases of abuse of office should be investigated by regular prosecutors, not the specialized unit, known as the DNA, that deals with graft.

Social Democrat party leader Liviu Dragnea was sentenced in June to three and a half years in prison for incitement to abuse of office, though an appeal is still pending.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",Citizenship? Permanent residence? - Brits in France fret over Brexit,"NIORT, France (Reuters) - Two years of Brexit uncertainty have given British citizens in France sleepless nights and a bureaucratic headache, with thousands of them hurrying to apply for nationality to secure their status before the divorce date set for next year.
Amanda and Robin Holmes are pillars of the community in their tiny village of Crezieres, nestled in rolling countryside in the west of France.
    Robin dishes out food packages to the needy through charity Restaurants du Coeur, Amanda runs a volunteer gardening group, and both sit on the local council.
    But until this week, neither of them were French.
    In the wake of the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to cut its ties with the European Union, the British-born Holmeses, who moved to France in 2004 under EU freedom of movement rules, applied for citizenship, worried they would be kicked off the council and keen to send a political message.
    ""I'm European and I'd like to stay European,"" former actress and yoga teacher Amanda, 67, said on the eve of a citizenship ceremony organised in the local town of Niort.
    Interior ministry figures show eight times more Britons applied for French nationality in 2017 than in 2015, the year before the Brexit vote.
    Many applicants are driven by fears that Brexit will jeopardise their right to live and work in France.
    The advice from both governments is that British residents in France apply for a ""carte de sejour"" -- a residence permit issued to all foreign nationals but not normally needed by EU citizens -- to prove their rights after Brexit.
Citizens' rights organisations say some local authorities are reluctant to follow that advice and process the applications for Britons, however, and that those that do take months, with confusing lists of demands and documents.
    Briton Jacqui Brown was one of Holmes's yoga pupils, and she has lived in nearby Loubille with her husband Adrian for 14 years. Their son, now 18, went to the village school, and Jacqui volunteers in her local library.
    Her husband works in professional training as a freelancer, taking advantage of the local area's excellent air connections and his EU passport to travel across the bloc, though most often back to Britain.
    With his clients based there, the drop in the value of the pound has already wiped 20 percent off the family's income, Jacqui says. She fears that the effect of Brexit on the British economy along with an end to free movement could threaten their livelihood in France altogether.
    ""Nobody can give you the answers because nobody knows... So you've spent two years living thinking, 'What is going to happen?',"" she said.
    A long-planned summit between British Prime Minister Theresa May and other EU leaders next week, originally seen as the deadline for signing off on a deal, looms.
    In the run-up, governments on both sides have sought to allay fears, with May assuring EU citizens in Britain in September that they are welcome to stay and France's Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau last week promising to ensure Brits in France get ""reciprocal rights"".
But the citizens' rights pressure group British in Europe says the warm words have no legal clout and are contingent on them being respected by both sides.
    Freedom of movement is a particular concern, group member Kathryn Dobson said whilst shopping for cheese in the weekly market in Civray.
    British in Europe is calling for rights to be ring-fenced and guaranteed by both sides, even if no deal is reached between the EU and the British government.
    ""What we would say is: Do what you promised. You promised us we would not lose our rights, that we would be able to live as we do now, and that's all we're asking for,"" Dobson said, sending a message to May before the summit.
    Civray and the surrounding area is home to so many Brits that local translator Eloisa Thomas has set up a service helping them clear the administrative hurdles they come to, including in applications for residence permits.
    She currently has 30 on the go and says her clients, many of them pensioners, are extremely anxious.
    But at the citizenship ceremony in the local government office in Niort on Tuesday, sighs of relief could be heard as the chorus of the Marseillaise died away.
    ""We're now French. And happy,"" said Robin Holmes.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",U.S. pastor Brunson arrives home in Turkey after release by court,"By Ezgi Erkoyun and Emily Wither
IZMIR, Turkey (Reuters) - The American evangelical Christian pastor at the center of a row between Ankara and Washington arrived at his home in Turkey on Friday after a Turkish court ruled he could go free, a move that may signal a major step toward mending ties between the allies.
Andrew Brunson arrived at his home in Turkey's coastal province of Izmir, a Reuters cameraman said, having left the courthouse in a convoy of cars. 
He was released after the court sentenced him to three years and 1-1/2 months in prison on terrorism charges, but said he would not serve any further jail time. The pastor has lived in Turkey for more than 20 years and was put in prison two years ago and has been under house arrest since July.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed sanctions on Turkey in an attempt to secure Brunson's freedom, tweeted: ""PASTOR BRUNSON JUST RELEASED. WILL BE HOME SOON!""
Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and red tie, the North Carolina native wept as the decision was announced, witnesses said. Before the judge's ruling he had told the court: ""I am an innocent man. I love Jesus, I love Turkey.""
After the ruling, Brunson's lawyer told reporters the pastor was likely to leave Turkey. The U.S. military has a plan to fly Brunson back to America on a military aircraft, officials told Reuters. 
The diplomatic stand-off over Brunson, who had been pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, had accelerated a sell-off in Turkey's lira currency, worsening a financial crisis.
Brunson had been accused of links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a coup attempt in 2016. Brunson denied the accusation and Washington had demanded his immediate release.
Witnesses told the court in the western town of Aliaga that testimonies against the pastor attributed to them were inaccurate.
Brunson's wife Norine looked on from the visitors' area.
'GREAT CHRISTIAN'
Brunson's mother told Reuters she and his father were elated at the news. ""We are overjoyed that God has answered the prayers of so many people around the world,"" she said.
Trump has scored points with evangelical Christians, a large part of his political base, by focusing on the Brunson case. The release could boost Trump's ability to encourage such voters to support Republicans in large numbers in Nov. 6 elections, which will determine whether the party keeps control of Congress. 
The heavily conservative constituency voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016. He has called Brunson a ""great Christian"", and Vice President Mike Pence, the White House's top emissary to evangelicals, had urged Americans to pray for Brunson.
U.S. broadcaster NBC said on Thursday that Washington had done a secret deal with Ankara to secure Brunson's release. 
The lira stood at 5.910 to the dollar at 1336 GMT, little changed on the day after firming 3 percent on Thursday on expectations that Brunson would be freed.
NATO ALLIES
Relations between the two NATO allies are also under strain over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, Turkey's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system, and the U.S. jailing of a executive at a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions-busting case.
With Brunson's release, attention may now turn to the fate of a Turkish-U.S. national and former NASA scientist in jail in Turkey on terrorism charges, as well as three local employees of the U.S. consulate who have also been detained.
Washington wants all these people released, while Ankara has demanded the extradition of Gulen. The cleric, who was lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denies any role in the attempted coup. 
Friday's decision could be a first step to ease tensions. 

Further moves which have been discussed include the return to Turkey of bank executive Mehmet Hakan Attila to serve out his sentence, the release of the U.S. consular staff, and agreement that the U.S. Treasury avoid draconian steps against Halkbank, the state lender.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Bangladesh PM takes aim at photographer, critics say it is part of wider crackdown","By Jonathan Spicer and Serajul Quadir
NEW YORK/DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is convinced that jailed photographer Shahidul Alam instigated trouble by spreading what she describes as ""false news"" about protests against her rule in August. 
In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Hasina described Alam, who is known as one of South Asia's preeminent photographers, as ""mentally sick"" and blamed his behavior on his family background – Alam's great uncle was on the opposing side to Hasina's father in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan.
She offered no evidence for her accusations, which Alam's family and lawyer reject. 
Alam was arrested in August, hours after criticizing the government's response to widespread student protests. 
His detention has been widely seen as a test for freedom of speech in the country and has sparked worldwide demands for his release.
Hasina, who was returned unopposed in 2014 after the opposition boycotted the poll, is seeking a third term in an election at the end of December against a backdrop of growing dissent at what critics believe is her increasingly authoritarian government.
    ""You are now guilty until proven innocent - we have a reverse system,"" said Ataur Rahman, a professor of political science at Dhaka University. ""People don't want to be engaged in debates in case they end up like Shahidul.""
    Told of Hasina's comments, Alam's family said the government had already decided on his guilt before a trial can be held. ""It shows they have already made their judgment,"" said Alam's niece, Dilruba Karim. She added that Hasina's comments ""are hugely cruel and don't befit the leader of a so-called democracy"".
Anisul Huq, a cabinet minister who handles legal affairs in Hasina's government, said the country's judicial system has ""full independence and freedom"". 
    Alam, a long-term critic of Hasina's Awami League, is being investigated under a controversial section of the Information and Communication Technology Act, which Human Rights Watch says has been used by Hasina's government in a number of arbitrary detentions of government critics and is one of several laws that have been used to stifle free speech.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has called the case ""rife with due process violations"", an accusation that Huq denied.
Alam's lawyer, Shahdeen Malik, said his comments during the protests did not constitute a criminal offence, and that Hasina's remarks regarding Alam's uncle suggested a ""feudal"" justice system. 
    Hasina's government has also introduced laws that prescribe jail time for those spreading ""propaganda"" against the country, while her main political rival, Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges she claims were part of a plot to prevent her from challenging Hasina.
    The government firmly denies it has interfered with freedom of speech. ""No government has safeguarded and upheld principles of freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of press as much as this government of Hasina has done,"" Huq said.
    ""GOONS"" WIELDING RODS 
    Alam was detained for what the government says was misleading reporting on the demonstrations, that began because of the deaths of two school students in a traffic accident before escalating into the widest anti-government protests in years. Alam says he was covering the demonstrations as a photojournalist.
    In one of a dozen Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) videos he posted from the protest site, Alam said he had been attacked and had his camera smashed by ""goons"" wielding metal rods and sticks from the Chhatra League, a student movement affiliated with the ruling Awami League. He later posted a photograph he said showed men from the movement wearing masks and being allowed to disrupt the protests in full view of police officers.
Biplob Barua, a senior leader in the Awami League, said the allegations made by Alam in the Facebook videos about attacks on students and the failure of the police to act were ""totally false"" and had provoked additional violence.
Photographs of protesters being attacked by young men are widely available online but Reuters could not verify what group the assailants belonged to.
Alam was picked up hours after giving an interview to Al Jazeera in which he accused the government of involvement in extrajudicial killings in the past.
The government has denied allegations of sanctioning extrajudicial killings in its controversial anti-drugs campaign.
""SAVE THE CHILDREN""
    Hasina said in the interview with Reuters in New York late last month that Alam had spread false news as authorities were trying to calm the students.
    ""He tried to use this situation, to instigate it,"" she said. ""We tried to save the children but he tried to use these children. All the false news he started... how can you accept it?""
    In the interview, she also sharply criticized Alam's deceased great uncle, Abdus Sabur Khan, a former government minister who opposed Bangladesh's independence and allied with Pakistan.
    ""He opposed our liberation war, he joined Pakistan, he didn't accept Bangladesh. In 1971 he was with the Pakistani occupation army,"" Hasina said. ""Sometimes blood speaks, you understand that.""
The war for independence is still a sensitive topic in the country. 
    A new law, called the Digital Security Act, signed into law by the nation's president on Monday despite protests from local journalists and the United States, stipulates a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for several offences, including secretly recording inside government buildings and spreading ""propaganda"" against Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence.
    Hasina told Reuters that reporters had nothing to fear from the Digital Security Act.

    ""If they have confidence that they will not do anything wrong then why should they worry,"" she said.

In August, Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Canada, expelled envoy Dennis Horak and ordered all Saudi students home after the Canadian embassy issued a tweet urging the immediate release of women's rights activists.
Horak told Reuters on Wednesday that Ottawa had not done enough to deepen ties with Riyadh and had made mistakes that helped prompt the dispute.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A lawsuit challenging the use of race as a factor in U.S. college admissions will go to trial in Boston on Monday, when Harvard University will face accusations that it discriminates against Asian-American applicants. 
The lawsuit, backed by the Trump administration, could eventually reach the Supreme Court, giving the newly cemented five-member conservative majority a chance to bar the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college.
""The case is critically important as it's really about diversity at colleges all across the country,"" said Nicole Gon Ochi, an attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice–Los Angeles who supports Harvard in the case.
Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, sued Harvard in 2014, contending it illegally engages in ""racial balancing"" that artificially limits the number of Asian-American students at the Ivy League school.
The U.S. Justice Department, which launched a related probe of Harvard after Republican President Donald Trump's election, has backed the group, saying the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university has not seriously considered alternative, race-neutral approaches to admissions.
Conservatives argue that affirmative action, which aims to offset historic patterns of racial discrimination, can hurt white people and Asian Americans while helping black and Hispanic applicants.
SFFA said that its analysis of Harvard admissions data shows that Asian-American applicants are less likely to be admitted than their white, Hispanic or black counterparts.
Harvard denies discriminating against Asian Americans, saying their rates of admission have grown significantly since 2010. Asian-Americans, who represent about 6 percent of the U.S. population, make up 23 percent of Harvard's current freshman class.
It notes that the Supreme Court has previously held that colleges have an interest in enrolling diverse groups of students and may consider race as one factor among many when reviewing applications.
The last time the nation's top court examined the issue was in 2016, when conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the court's liberals to allow race to be considered in college admissions. Kennedy's replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, could be more likely to vote to bar its use.
""This is one area where there could be a significant change by replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.
The Justice Department last month opened a probe into whether Yale University also discriminates against Asian Americans, and SFFA has a similar case pending against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on behalf of white students. 

""A student's race or ethnicity should not be a consideration in university admissions,"" Blum said.

Chanting the slogan ""We are all Spain,"" unionist demonstrators waved Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags as they marched through the city center, an area usually busy with tourists.
Protesters carried signs criticizing separatist leader and regional president Quim Torra and former leader Carles Puigdemont, who is now in self-imposed exile in Belgium.
Elsewhere in Barcelona, riot police separated a small counter-demonstration billed as ""anti-fascist"" from unionists. Last month, police arrested six people following clashes with separatist protesters. Friday's protest ended without incident. 
Despite reduced tensions between Madrid and Barcelona in recent months, a solution to the Catalan crisis appears distant as the government has ruled out granting any referendum on secession.
Separatist parties supported on Thursday a motion in the regional parliament criticizing King Felipe for his response to events in Catalonia last year. The king had spoken out against the independence campaign. 
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez described the Catalan parliament's move as ""unacceptable"" on Thursday, saying the government would take steps to protect the monarchy and other institutions.
In Madrid on Friday, Sanchez and King Felipe attended the annual military parade marking Spain's national day and the anniversary of explorer Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on behalf of the Spanish crown. 
Polls in Catalonia show a relatively even split between those who favor remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede.
The regional government held an independence referendum in September last year that was deemed illegal by Madrid.
It subsequently made a unilateral declaration of independence, prompting the government of then prime minister Mario Rajoy to suspend the regional assembly and impose direct rule from Madrid.

Jerusalem Magistrates Court awarded the three 17-year-old girls 45,000 shekels ($12,426.48), plus costs and lawyers' fees, according to a brief court summary of Wednesday's ruling. 
The case arose from an open letter that activists Justine Sachs and Nadia Abu-Shanab wrote to Lorde, a New Zealander, on the web site ""thespinoff.co.nz"" last December urging her to call off her planned concert.
Lorde canceled her concert in Israel that same month after a campaign by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) group, which campaigns for Palestinian rights, that included the open letter published by Sachs and Abu-Shanab.
Sachs and Abu-Shanab were not present at Wednesday's hearing and were not believed to be in Israel. Reuters could not immediately confirm their location. 
But they wrote on ""thespinoff.co.nz"" that they believed the ruling was a ""stunt"" intended to intimidate Israel's critics. Instead of paying the fine, they said, they would use the publicity the ruling had created to raise at least the same amount for mental health treatment in Gaza, a Palestinian enclave under Islamist rule that is blockaded by Israel.
""We’re just one tiny part of a growing and vibrant movement, and while we’re proud to play our part, credit goes to Lorde for having the human decency to take a stand,"" the two wrote.
An Israeli court spokesman said the session was heard in camera and the identity of the three plaintiffs was withheld because they were minors. 
The case was pursued by Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, a Tel Aviv-based lawyer who campaigns against boycotts of Israel. She brought it on behalf of the three girls, describing them as fans of Lorde who were disappointed not to be able to see her perform. 
Darshan-Leitner welcomed the ruling but conceded that it was unlikely to be enforced in New Zealand.
""As far as I know, there is no reciprocal enforcement of judgments with New Zealand, but there are agreements with other countries, such as the United States. We will be following the movement of these women and if they enter those countries or have assets there, action can be taken,"" she told Reuters.
A number of international performers have canceled shows or have refused to appear in Israel in recent years after heeding calls from the BDS. Palestinians seek statehood in territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities on Friday barred a former lawmaker from contesting an election next month given her past advocacy of greater autonomy for Hong Kong, in a decision critics called another instance of political and electoral suppression.
Lau Siu-lai of the Labour Party was elected a lawmaker in 2016 but later disqualified from office along with five other pro-democracy lawmakers for taking improper oaths of office. Lau, who is also a sociology lecturer, will not now be able to try to win back her seat in a by-election in November.
Hong Kong's government was widely criticized at home and abroad a week ago for effectively expelling a British journalist for hosting a speech by an independence activist at a press club.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including freedom of the press, not enjoyed elsewhere in China.
Lau has advocated self-determination for Hong Kong, suggesting it should enjoy greater autonomy from China.
The government said in a statement Lau did not comply with electoral laws ""since advocating or promoting self-determination"" contravened a legal requirement that all candidates must uphold Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which states that the city is an inalienable part of China. 
Lau was also accused by an electoral officer of not accepting China's sovereignty over the financial hub.
Lau was not given an opportunity to defend her candidacy with authorities before the decision.
A small group of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists protested outside government headquarters, holding up banners decrying the decision as ""political suppression"".
Hong Kong authorities in January banned democracy activist Agnes Chow from contesting a separate by-election, fuelling fears of tightening political ""red lines"" by Beijing that could deny Hong Kong's disaffected young people any political outlet beyond street protest.
Another pro-democracy candidate and former veteran lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan submitted his nomination on Friday for the by-election that is crucial for the city's opposition to recapture their disqualified seats and veto bloc.
""The disqualification is dirty play on the part of the government. They're trying to manipulate the whole election to benefit the whole pro-government camp,"" Lee told Reuters.

""My objective is to win and I think we can win ... because the people are outraged. They are trying to deprive people of their political rights so I think the people will support me.""

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Coalition must do more for Syria's smashed Raqqa: Amnesty,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-led air strikes destroyed much of Syria's Raqqa while crushing Islamic State last year, but the coalition has done little to help it recover, rights group Amnesty International said on Friday. 
Nearly a year after the battle, 80 percent of the city is in ruins and thousands of bodies lie in the rubble, with funding to recover them poised to run out, said Anya Neistat, Amnesty's senior director of global research. 
""It's absolutely shocking in Raqqa how little over this last year has actually been done to bring life back to the city,"" she said at a news conference in Beirut after visiting Raqqa.
""The coalition, given that they have the money to carry out this very, very expensive military campaign, should have enough money to work with its consequences,"" she added. 
Raqqa was the Syrian capital of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate and was retaken last year by a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition. 
The jihadists made it hard to take the city without killing civilians, blending in with the local population and using car bombs as they retreated from street to street. 
By the time Kurdish fighters tore down the group's last flag on October 17, entire districts lay in ruins, Reuters reporters covering the battle said.
""30,000 houses in Raqqa have been completely destroyed and 25,000 are partially destroyed,"" said Neistat.
So far about 2,500 bodies have been dug from the rubble. 
""To the extent that they are able to identify the bodies, they believe that the majority of them are civilians. And the majority of these civilians have died as a result of coalition air strikes,"" she said. 
""Nobody knows what's going to happen to the 3,000 bodies that still lie in the ground come 31 October when the funding for this team runs out,"" she said. 
The coalition says it works on stabilization in Raqqa, not reconstruction. 
""The number's around 3 million people liberated, which is a good thing. There was a lot of damage. I don't think the problem lies with coalition countries not wanting to help,"" said Colonel Sean Ryan, the coalition spokesman. 
He pointed to coalition countries not being able to work with the Damascus government, which opposes their presence, as an obstacle to channeling help. 
Amnesty in June said coalition strikes may have broken international law, which it denied. The coalition says it worked hard to avoid deaths and is transparent in its efforts to investigate. 

People in Raqqa said their main priority was education after suffering years of Islamic State rule, but the few schools that had reopened were heavily overcrowded and riddled with war damage, Neistat said.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",France's far-right says ready to work with former Trump aide Bannon,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen met Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon and backed his plan to advise euroskeptic parties ahead of next year's European elections, a senior lawmaker in her party said on Friday.
A few days earlier, Le Pen had appeared to distance herself from Bannon. At a meeting with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Monday, she said Bannon was American and it was up to European parties to shape their own politics.
But at their meeting on Thursday, Bannon, an architect of President Trump's 2016 election victory and former chairman of Breitbart news, may have won Le Pen round, according to Louis Aliot, a senior member of Le Pen's National Rally and also her partner. 
""Bannon wants to create a think-tank, and particularly wants to provide technical support to euroskeptic parties,"" Aliot told BFM TV. ""We're not going to say no since he's not creating a political party.""
In July, Bannon said he aimed to create an organization called The Movement to unite Europe's far-right ahead of the May 2019 European Parliament elections. But he has generated little support from parties so far. 
Aliot said any misunderstandings between Bannon and Le Pen had been reconciled during their meeting.
""We've seen that there was a convergence of views,"" Aliot said, adding that Bannon would not campaign in the European elections or provide financing, but would offer advice and expertise. 
Le Pen, who has struggled to rebound since losing last year's presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron, is banking on the European election to boost her party, which came first in France in the last such vote, in 2014.
The campaign is shaping up as a battle between Macron's vision of a more integrated, united European Union and Le Pen's view that too much national identity has been surrendered to Brussels.
In a survey by pollster Elabe last week, the number of French voters who regard the EU as having more benefits than drawbacks dropped by eight percentage points from a year ago, to 24 percent. 
Thirty-eight percent said the EU brought more drawbacks than benefits, while nearly two-thirds said they did not think Macron would be able to change the EU for the better, despite it being one of his main policy goals.

Bannon won resounding applause for a speech at a Le Pen's party congress in March and has maintained regular contacts since, party officials said.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","In sign of better relations, Rwandan heads Francophonie body","YEREVAN (Reuters) - Rwanda's foreign minister was named head of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) on Friday, a sign of slowly improving relations between Paris and Kigali a decade after the African nation turned its back on the French language.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced his support for Louise Mushikiwabo's candidacy during a visit to Paris earlier this year by Rwandan leader Paul Kagame, who has long accused France of complicity in the 1994 genocide.
""As secretary-general, I intend to give importance to French in an increasingly multilingual world because I am convinced that French has its place among other languages and for the good of the world,"" Mushikiwabo told an OIF summit in Armenia.
The OIF represents 84 countries where French is spoken or where there is an affinity toward French culture, including many former French colonies.
For decades France claimed Rwanda, a former Belgian colony where French was an official language alongside Kinyarwanda, as part of the Francophone fold. 
But embittered by the legacy of France's role in the genocide, Kagame, whose Tutsi rebels ended the massacre, ditched French in favor of English in Rwanda's schools in 2010.
Kagame, an English speaker who spent his formative years in exile in neighboring Uganda, led Rwanda in 2009 to join the Commonwealth of mainly former British colonies.
Asked if Macron's backing of Mushikiwabo pointed to improved ties between the two countries, a French presidency official said: ""His support deepens the dialogue between the two presidents but it will not be the act that leads to a normalization of relations.""
The official said neither Kagame, who made a speech in French at the OIF summit, nor France at this point wanted a resumption of full diplomatic relations.
Kagame has been lauded by some Western powers for masterminding the economic transformation a country deeply scarred by the genocide -- during which Hutu extremists killed some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over the course of 100 days. However he is also accused by rights groups of trampling on the opposition and muzzling dissent, accusations his government rejects.
Mushikiwabo is a member of Kagame's inner circle and one his most trusted ministers, holding the foreign ministry portfolio since 2009.
Macron said in March he wanted French to be more widespread.
He also wants to reshape France's relationship with the African continent, seeking to shake off the tag of former colonial power motivated by commercial gain and shift the focus to education and investing in youth. 
""It is the first important signal that both Rwanda and France are willing to engage in friendly gestures,"" said Rwandan political analyst Christopher Kayumba, adding some government officials had begun tweeting in French in recent days.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has warned operators of electrical power links with Europe that they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if the country leaves the European Union next year with no exit deal.
The United Kingdom imports around 6 percent of its electricity via power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland but plans to build several more.
Companies operating electricity interconnectors, which include Britain's  National Grid  (LON:NG) and French grid operator RTE, should ""carry out contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ scenario"", a government paper said.
In the event of no deal on Britain's EU exit, European energy law will no longer apply to the UK electricity market.
The paper said the government and energy regulator Ofgem were working with interconnector operators ""to ensure new access rules are approved in Great Britain and are providing support to interconnectors engaging with EU Member State authorities"".
Britain has issued a series of papers outlining the implications of a no-deal Brexit for a range of sectors.
The British government wants to increase power supply options, such as new interconnectors, as old domestic coal and nuclear plants close from the mid-2020s.
However, Norway's state-owned grid operator Statnett [STASF.UL] warned earlier this year that Brexit could hamper new projects, including two planned links with Norway.
A separate paper said gas trading between Britain and Europe was not expected to change significantly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

KUCOVA, Albania (Reuters) - Long the graveyard of its once mighty air force, Albania's base at Kucova is set to become a NATO station - to the delight of its former airmen longing to hear the engines roar again.
Albania retired its 224 Soviet- and Chinese-made MiGs in 2005, and since 2009 NATO neighbors Italy and Greece monitor its airspace. That led to economic decline in and around Kucova, which was called ""Stalin City"" during the era of Communist rule.
""The base is the first footprint of NATO in the Western Balkans as it will transform Kucova into the first NATO air base for the region,"" Defence Minister Olta Xhacka told Reuters.
NATO will spend over 50 million euros ($58 million) on the first stage of work to turn Kucova into a support base for supplies, logistics, training and drills, Xhacka said.
Albania feels it has earned such a transformation at the base for helping maintain stability in the Balkans and contributing to NATO peacekeeping missions around the world.
""The region as a whole has entered into an irreversible Euro-Atlantic integration process,"" Xhacka added.
News of a NATO base has stirred hopes in Kucova.
Civilians see the base project as an economic boost for an area plagued by emigration and unemployment. The last generation of trained pilots, now in their early fifties, are keen to hear the rumble of engines again, while younger people on the site mull quitting due to their low wages.
Sheep graze in the bushes between the taxiing lanes and the runway. Some 88 MiGs squat on their flat tires near three underground hangars, while birds sing around them.
The runway, conceived by Soviet planners who stored dynamite under the airfield to blow it up should it fall into enemy hands and built by political prisoners in the 1950s, has good weather conditions all year round.
""A NATO base there will boost the country's defence capacities, and foreign investors will have more confidence in Albania. It will also be good for employment in the area,"" said 68-year-old retired air force commander Klement Alikaj.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the archbishop of Washington D.C. over the handling of Catholic Church sex abuse cases, praising the close ally for stepping down in the name of unity rather than fighting accusations of a cover-up.
With his resignation on Friday, Cardinal Donald Wuerl became one of the highest ranking Catholic leaders to step aside over global accusations that the Church harbored sex abusers.
And the resignation further exposes a rift within the Church between Francis and a conservative wing that has opposed his efforts to be more welcoming to divorced Catholics and homosexuals.
The cardinal, one of the most prominent Church figures in the United States, has been a strong defender of Francis, who has been criticized by conservatives in the Church, some of whom say the pope himself should resign over the sexual abuse crisis.
In a glowing letter of support, Francis made clear that he accepted Wuerl's resignation reluctantly, at Wuerl's insistence, and believed he was not guilty of trying to conceal abuse.
""You have sufficient elements to 'justify' your actions and distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes. However, your nobility has led you not to choose this way of defense. Of this, I am proud and thank you,"" the pope wrote.
Wuerl has come under fire since the release in August of a U.S. Grand Jury report on sexual abuse, which found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen over the course of 70 years.
The report covered six diocese in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh, where Wuerl served as archbishop from 1998-2006. The report mentioned Wuerl's name more than 200 times. Wuerl has defended his overall record in Pittsburgh. 
In a highly unusual move, Francis asked Wuerl, who keeps the title of cardinal, to stay on as administrator of the Washington diocese until another archbishop could be appointed. Usually a new bishop is announced at the same time as such a resignation.
The Washington position is the most important and visible for the Church in the United States because of its proximity to national political power.
""Francis would want to take his time in finding a successor in sympathy with his vision of where the Church should be going,"" said Father Tom Reese, author of several books on the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church in the United States.
ERRORS IN JUDGMENT
In a statement thanking the Pope, Wuerl said he apologized for ""any past errors in judgment"".
""My resignation is one way to express my great and abiding love for you, the people of the Church of Washington,"" he said.
The Church has recently been hit by one sexual abuse scandal after another, from Germany, to the United States, to Chile. At the same time, a deepening polarization between conservatives and liberals in the Church has played out on social media.
In his letter to Wuerl, the pope said he recognized that Wuerl wanted to step down for the greater good of the Church. He also thanked Wuerl for ""actions that support, stimulate and make the unity and mission of the Church grow above every kind of sterile division sown by the father of lies.""
In Christian parlance, ""father of lies"" is a synonym for the devil. Francis has said the devil is ultimately behind sex abuse of children by priests and current divisions in the Church. 
Wuerl has also been accused of knowing that his predecessor in Washington, ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick, had forced male adult seminarians to have sex with him years ago. Wuerl denies having been aware.
In July McCarrick became the first cardinal in about 100 years to be stripped of his red hat and title of ""eminence"".

Francis ordered McCarrick to retire to a life of prayer and penitence after American Church officials said as part of a separate investigation that allegations that McCarrick had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Luxembourg may revert to political tradition on Sunday if an election confirms opinion polls showing a resurgence for its long-dominant center-right party at the expense of the liberal-led coalition.
Surveys indicate the Christian Social People's Party (CSV), led for decades by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and by far the biggest single group, will end Xavier Bettel's five-year term as only the second non-CSV leader since World War Two.
The conservatives, however, may lack an outright majority in the 60-seat chamber after a campaign focused on local issues, notably housing. If so, leader Claude Wiseler could try to renew Juncker's pre-2013 coalition with Etienne Schneider's Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP), Bettel's Democratic Party or with Greens.
These three parties seized on a surprise setback for Juncker when he called a snap election after a wiretapping scandal to form a three-way coalition in the Grand Duchy under Bettel that froze the CSV out of power for the first time since the war.
That ended Juncker's 20 years as prime minister and saw him move to Brussels the following year as president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm.
However, external policy for the EU's second-smallest state is unlikely to change much. Successive governments have defended a 40-year-old economic model based on financial services and low corporate taxation. 
To avoid isolation in the EU, Luxembourg has been adapting its long-term economic plan under pressure from bigger neighbors who have branded it a tax haven and a money-laundering hub.
Also the wealthiest country in the bloc, Luxembourg has seen little of the controversies over immigration that have boosted far-right parties' popularity ahead of May's elections to the European Parliament, although in 2015 Luxembourg's 250,000 electors decisively rejected giving the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreign, mostly from other EU states.

On March 29, Britain is due to become the first country to ever leave the EU. It expects a status-quo transition until the end of 2020 during which it would continue paying contributions to the bloc and follow its rules.
It would in exchange keep access to the bloc's single market and customs union but no longer have a say in decision-making that would be done by the other 27 states staying in the EU.
After Brexit, the EU wants to wind down in stages all the rebates, including those that the Netherlands or Denmark enjoy. [nL8N1WS26X] The bloc's executive European Commission has proposed to have none in the next common budget for 2021-2024.
""I think that even for the pleasant but improbable case that the British wish to remain... then in my budgetary framework I would stick to the phased ending of rebates. The rebates, in a family of 27, are no longer appropriate.""
Britain currently can recover about a half of its contributions to the bloc through the deal. 
Many question whether Britain and the EU can finalize extremely complex negotiations on a new, broad trade pact in less than two years. 

Any extension of the transition period, as suggested by Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond on Friday [nL9N1VZ00W], would raise the issue of the British rebate as it would coincide with the bloc entering the new budgetary period that could already be rebate-free.

Germany coordinated the decision with Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, a ministry spokeswoman said. The Danish government made a similar announcement on Friday, citing the threat of terrorism.
Germany and other countries in Europe's normally controls-free Schengen zone introduced emergency border controls in 2015 after more than 1 million refugees and migrants entered Europe.
The extension, which takes effect in December, will keep the controls in place until May 11, 2019.
The aim was still to return to passport-free travel within the EU but the conditions for that did not yet exist, with a lot of migrants still entering the country illegally, the spokeswoman said.
She dismissed any suggestion that the extension had deliberately been made public two days before a key regional election in Bavaria, where Horst Seehofer's Christian Social Union (CSU) - the sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats - are heading for their worst showing in over 60 years.

The CSU is keen to be seen as taking a tough line on immigration to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is expected to enter the Bavarian parliament for the first time.

Xu Longwei, who pleaded not guilty, was convicted in July of forcing himself on the woman in an hour-long ordeal at a hotel room overlooking Sydney Harbour after the dinner at which they met.
He was sentenced to four years' jail, of which he must serve at least two and a half.
Court documents filed by the prosecution said that Xu's victim, then 20, was encouraged to drink to excess at the dinner.
The pair then went to the Shangri-La Hotel where the jury found Xu committed seven separate sexual offences, including intercourse without consent. None of the charges used the term ""rape"".
Judge Nicole Norman, who handed down the sentence in a Sydney court, said the woman was unwell by the time she had left the party and she gave evidence that she vomited on the way to the hotel room where Xu forcibly removed her clothes and pinned her down.
""She said at one stage Mr Xu said to her that she could not refuse him,"" Judge Norman said. ""Mr Xu took advantage of the victim's alcohol-rendered vulnerability.
""Mr Xu persisted over objection and resistance. He exploited the situation. His comment about her not being able to resist him ... reflects his arrogance and his low regard for the victim.""
Xu, wearing a prison-green track suit, hardly reacted as the sentence was handed down. His lawyer, Winston Terracini, had told the court that Xu ""maintains his innocence and denies the offences"".
Judge Norman made clear that Liu, who founded the Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com in 2004, had no role in the offences.
In a separate case, Liu was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in August on suspicion of rape. He was released in less than a day without charges and returned to China.
U.S. prosecutors are weighing whether to bring charges after police turned over the findings of their investigations, according to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. A Minnesota-based lawyer for Liu had earlier said that Liu denied any wrongdoing and that he did not expect his client to be charged.

Le Pen, who so far has been questioned on allegations of breach of trust, is now under formal investigation over accusations of embezzling public funds, the source said.
Le Pen and her National Rally party, formerly known as the National Front, deny any wrongdoing.
The Paris prosecutor's office opened the investigation in December 2016, saying it aimed to ascertain whether the then National Front had used money destined to EU parliamentary assistants to pay staff who were working for the party.
EU lawmakers are allocated funds to cover expenses, including their assistants, but are not meant to use them for party expenses.

Le Pen reached the second round of France's presidential elections last year before being defeated by Emmanuel Macron and his centrist En Marche movement.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Brazil presidential frontrunner's advisers clash over Petrobras,"By Alexandra Alper, Tatiana Bautzer and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Nationalistic and free market advisers to Brazil's right-wing presidential frontrunner are deeply split about the future of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, foreshadowing a showdown over divestments and fuel subsidies.
University of Chicago-educated banker Paulo Guedes, economic adviser to frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro, has said he favors full privatization of Petrobras. Failing that, investors hope he can promote a business-friendly agenda such as asset sales to reduce the company's $74 billion net debt.
Federal prosecutors in Brazil said on Wednesday that Guedes was being investigated over accusations of fraud tied to the pension funds of state-run companies, and Bolsonaro has rejected one of his policy recommendations.
Meanwhile, an increasingly vocal cadre of military generals stressing the importance of maintaining Petrobras as a strategic asset have shown growing influence. 
Bolsonaro himself was an early supporter of a truckers' strike this year over rising diesel prices. The government ultimately ended the strike by meddling in Petrobras' ability to set prices at the pump, another policy that investors would like to see the government end.
Petrobras shares spiked 10 percent on Monday as investors bet a Bolsonaro administration would mostly give the company free rein in terms of selling off units to cut debt or setting fuel prices according to market forces.
The former army captain's surge in the polls, topped by his win in the first round of voting, sparked a rally that has added $18 billion to the state oil company's market value this month. But tensions between the two wings of Bolsonaro's campaign threaten to cut the euphoria short. 
One senior member of Bolsonaro's entourage, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issues, said he had called for Petrobras to be broken into four companies and for three to be sold off. 
""Now the final word on all this will rest with Bolsonaro,"" he said. ""I don't think he really wants to.""
Bolsonaro voted as a legislator to preserve the state oil company's monopoly on exploration and production and as a candidate he has taken a wide range of stances. Mirroring the views of some of the generals close to him, he has described Petrobras as a strategic asset. 
""I believe we need to keep the core of Petrobras,"" he said in an interview with TV station Band on Wednesday night. ""The question of refining, refineries, I think that you can move gradually toward privatizations.""
In another recent interview he said he opposed privatizing Petrobras but still could reluctantly move to end the oil company's ""monopoly"" in Brazil that he said gave it excessive pricing power.
Some 49.6 percent of Petrobras' stock is traded on the stock exchange.
A key adviser on infrastructure and energy issues, General Oswaldo de Jesus Ferreira, has described the company as a strategic asset that must stay in state hands.
""Given Jair Bolsonaro's history of voting in his nearly 30-years in congress, his connection with statist military sectors and the contradictory statements of his campaign leaders on the subject, it is hard to believe that he will include Petrobras in a program of privatizations,"" said Ricardo Lacerda, chief executive at investment bank BR Partners. ""The market seems overly optimistic about this issue.""
Fuel subsidies are another flashpoint. In May, Bolsonaro reacted to the strike by truckers angry about rising diesel prices. He enthusiastically backed the strike, tweeting that the movement showed ""how the people are robbed for the benefit of a political caste, which for decades has enslaved everyone."" 
The strike brought Brazil's economy to a standstill. To mollify the truckers, President Michel Temer's government dismantled a free-market fuel pricing policy and reintroduced fuel subsidies. This prompted Petrobras' market friendly CEO Pedro Parente to quit, and its share price tumbled.
Oil prices have risen further since May, but subsidies are due to expire in December. Whether to maintain the subsidies could present the first test of Bolsonaro's free market inclinations, if he wins the election and is inaugurated on Jan. 1.
Bolsonaro's platform, written by Guedes, among others, states that Petrobras should be able to follow international pricing but ease short-term volatility with hedges. Yet the candidate has declined to say definitively whether he would extend the diesel subsidy.
It is hard to know how a potential Bolsonaro government would handle issues like the truckers strike, said Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. ""Lots of contradictions still exist between Paulo Guedes' neo-liberal vision and the military's nationalist vision."" 
DEEP DIVIDES
Investors may be more realistic to hope for sales of Petrobras assets to relieve its hefty debt load, which Moody's Investors Service has said represents one-third of all Latin America's rated corporate debt.
Bolsonaro's party platform says the company should be able to sell substantial stakes in refining, wholesale, transport and other areas where it has market power.
Currently, a Supreme Court injunction triggered by a union lawsuit has halted sales of subsidiaries like its $7 billion TAG pipeline. 
Some observers fear Guedes' influence is on the wane. His uneasy alliance with Bolsonaro appeared to fray last month when Guedes proposed reviving an unpopular financial transactions tax known as the CPMF to raise government revenue. That idea was swiftly shot down by Bolsonaro and the once loquacious Guedes has barely been heard from since. 
Still, Bolsonaro confirmed on Thursday that he would name Guedes to oversee a ""super ministry"" combining the current finance, planning and development portfolios.
Despite the tug of war between his advisers, Bolsonaro's energy policies are more investor friendly than those of Workers Party standard-bearer Fernando Haddad, who will take him on in the second round on Oct. 28. 
Haddad's oil policy guru is former Petrobras CEO Sergio Gabrielli, whom many see as having presided over an era of corruption and mismanagement at the company. 
""For now, what Petrobras' share price reflects is simply a company which could remain free of the kind of intervention which the PT once promoted,"" said Marcio Correia, who manages 14 billion reais in equities at JGP Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro.

""But Petrobras shares could still appreciate more depending on what a potential Bolsonaro government does.""

Saudi authorities have detained more than a dozen women's rights activists since May. Most campaigned for the right to drive - which was granted in June - and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions.
Friday's statement, from experts who report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, called for the release of six women.
They include one, Israa Al-Ghomgham, who is facing possible execution, a threat the experts called ""reprehensible"".
They said they were in touch with Saudi authorities.
The Saudi mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Separately, Riyadh is facing increasing international pressure to explain the whereabouts of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic of the government, who went missing after last week entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get marriage documents.
Saudi authorities have dismissed as baseless allegations that he was killed inside the building and removed.
The U.N. experts said Al-Ghomgham, who belongs to Saudi's Shia minority, was being tried on charges that appeared to lack legal bases in a court set up to handle terrorism-related cases, and had had no legal representation.
""It is reprehensible that Ms. Al-Ghomgham is facing the death penalty for asserting her fundamental human right to peaceful assembly. No one should ever be punished for exercising their most fundamental human rights, much less face the death penalty,"" the U.N. experts said. 
""We wish to remind the Saudi government of its obligation to protect and promote the rights of all human rights defenders.""
Women were facing particular risks for challenging stereotypes about their place in society, the experts added.
They said the five other women named - including two other prominent activists, Samar Badawi and Hatoon Al-Fassi - were all being held incommunicado.

RUSE, Bulgaria (Reuters) - Hundreds of Bulgarians queued silently at a church in Ruse on Friday to pay their last respects to Viktoria Marinova, the television journalist whose brutal rape and murder shocked the country and triggered debates over freedom of the press.
The body of the 30-year-old Marinova, a host of a regional current affairs show at a local TV station, was found in a park near the Danube port of Ruse, her hometown, on Saturday. Police said she had been raped, beaten and strangled.
A Bulgarian man, Severin Krasimirov, 20, was arrested in Germany over the killing, and German authorities said he would be extradited to stand trial in Bulgaria soon.
Bulgarian prosecutors said no evidence indicated Marinova's death was related to her work. A random attack and sexual assault were the most likely motive, they said, although they were still investigating all possibilities.
In her last aired show, Marinova featured investigative journalists and pledged to engage in similar work, which stoked fears about retribution against journalists exposing corruption. She is the third journalist to be killed in the European Union within a year.
Marinova, who left a seven-year-old daughter, is to be buried later on Friday in Ruse Cemetery. More than 500 grieving Ruse citizens, carrying red and white carnations and funeral wreaths, flocked to the funeral service at the Sveta Troitsa (Holy Trinity) Cathedral.
People who knew her talked about her determination, responsibility and kindness, her charitable work and commitment to social causes such as support for disabled and disadvantage children, about which she also reported.
""Viktoria's death is a great loss for the whole city,"" Zornitsa Koleva, 48, said. ""She was so kind and ambitious at the same time. We all need to be united and show that we will do our best to prevent this from happening again in Ruse."" 
Many were also angered at the horrific murder and called for the toughest sentence for the perpetrator. 
Earlier on Friday, German authorities approved Krasimirov's extradition, saying that he had agreed to an expedited procedure. That meant he should be sent to Bulgaria within 10 days.
The suspect told German magistrates he had hit a woman he did not know while drunk and on drugs but denied intending to kill her, rape her or rob her. His mother, however, said he had told he had killed the journalist. 
Marinova's murder revived debate over the extent of press freedom in the Black Sea state, ranked 111 out of 180 countries this year in a world press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders.

Bulgaria also ranks worst in the EU for violence against women, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality.

BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - Munich-based German aircraft engine maker MTU Aero Engines has warned its employees against populism before a regional election in Bavaria, and consultants EY have issued their local staff with similar guidance.
Though neither company mentioned the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in their internal memoranda, the messages highlight corporate concerns about the rise of the far-right and perceived threats to German political stability.
The AfD, which has campaigned in Bavaria with the slogan ""our state, our homeland"", is poised to surge into the regional assembly in Bavaria for the first time after Sunday's vote.
MTU told employees in a letter: ""Populist slogans don't take our country forward, but rather targeted government action on the basis of our core values.""
""Germany, and especially a strategically-orientated industry like ours, relies on stable political conditions,"" MTU directors added in the letter, which was posted on the company's intranet and a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The directors stressed they were not advising their employees which party to back, but urged them to vote ""responsibly"". Around half of MTU's 10,000 workers are based in Bavaria.
The AfD has established itself across Germany with anti-Islamic rhetoric and attacks on Chancellor Angela Merkel's migrant policy. This is a particularly hot topic in Bavaria, where most of the 1.5 million asylum seekers who have reached Germany in the past three years entered the country.
The AfD's rise has eroded support for Merkel's allies in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU), who are set to lose the absolute majority with which they have controlled the southern state for most of the post-war period.
In Bavaria, support for the AfD - with whom the CSU has ruled out an alliance - stands at 10-14 percent, surveys show.
After the Bavarian vote, the AfD is set to have seats in 15 of Germany's 16 state assemblies and it is likely to enter the remaining one, Hesse, after a state election there on Oct. 28.
In an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by Reuters, EY's Munich-based managing director in Germany, Hubert Barth, wrote: ""Today, our liberal democracy is once again exposed to major attacks at home and from abroad.""
Referring to the ""landmark"" elections in Bavaria and Hesse - home to the financial center of Frankfurt - Barth added: ""Our democracy is an important part of our economic success.""
""I call on all colleagues to exercise their right to vote in order to strengthen the democratic and constitutional forces in our country,"" Barth concluded in his email, which was headed ""a political statement"".
The expected setback for the CSU risks widening divisions within Germany's crisis-prone national government, which depends on support from the Bavarian party.

Four opposition parties accuse the minister, Milan Kujundzic, of failing to tackle long waiting lists and a problem of medical staff leaving for better working conditions and higher salaries in other European Union countries.
In the 151-seat parliament, only 53 deputies out of the 130 present during the vote supported Kujundzic's removal.
""This is an attempt to politically discredit the minister,"" Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic had told parliament on Thursday ahead of an eight-hour debate on the opposition demand.
""Demands for his resignation are unfounded. Kujundzic is seeking to solve the problems accumulated in the health sector over years."" 
Croatia's health sector, together with pension system costs, present the biggest burden on state coffers.
The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and many analysts have warned Croatia for years that its health system is not sustainable without strong improvement in spending control and reduction of some capacities, including merging of hospitals in some areas.
The ruling conservative-liberal coalition, which has a tiny parliamentary majority of 77 deputies, has now seen six unsuccessful no-confidence motions against ministers and the government as a whole.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Princess Eugenie married wine merchant Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on Friday in front of celebrities and Britain's senior royals including Prince Harry and wife Meghan who wed at the same venue in May.
Eugenie, 28, younger daughter of the queen's third child, Prince Andrew, and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, tied the knot with Brooksbank, 32, in a traditional ceremony in the castle's 15th Century St George's Chapel.
It was the same setting as Harry and Meghan's wedding in May, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the couple are now known, were among the star-studded congregation.
The 92-year-old queen and her husband Philip, 97, who has retired from official engagements, were joined by other royals and celebrities including Hollywood stars Liv Tyler and Demi Moore, models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and singer Ellie Goulding.
Female guests had to cling on to their hats as a blustery wind threatened their wedding outfits and a page boy tripped on the stairs walking into the chapel. 
Eugenie’s dress, by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos of the London-based label Peter Pilotto, had a low back to reveal scars from surgery she underwent to correct scoliosis when she was 12.
""It's a lovely way to honor the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this,"" she told ITV's ""This Morning"" ahead of the wedding. 
The couple, while showing clear signs on nerves, beamed happily during the hour-long service.
""This is meant to be a family wedding,"" Eugenie’s father Andrew said earlier.
""There will be a few more people than most people have, there are a few more than Harry had, but that's just the nature of Eugenie and Jack - they've got so many friends that they need a church of that size to fit them all in,"" he told ""This Morning"" which broadcast the event live. 
CAMILLA ABSENT
Several hundred singing and cheering well-wishers gathered outside in Windsor in the shadow of the castle, far fewer than the thousands that crammed into the town for Harry's wedding.
""I'm a true royalist,"" David Weeks, 77, bedecked in a Union Jack suit and bowler hat, told Reuters. ""I was here for the queen's 90th birthday. I was here for Harry and Meghan's wedding, I wouldn't miss it, I love the atmosphere.""
The ceremony was conducted by the Dean of Windsor David Conner, and Eugenie's elder sister, Princess Beatrice, the maid of honor, read an extract from the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel ""The Great Gatsby"" which the bride had read after meeting her future husband in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier in 2010. 
""One particular passage in which Jay Gatsby is described reminded her immediately of Jack,"" Conner said. ""She decided she wanted eventually to let Jack know how much those words had brought him to mind.""
One noticeable absentee was Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as she was carrying out an engagement in Scotland. 
Princess Charlotte, 3, daughter of Harry's elder brother Prince William and his wife Kate, was a bridesmaid, and her brother, Prince George, 5, a page boy.
After the service, the couple took an open-top horse-drawn carriage tour of Windsor before a reception at the castle, hosted by the queen.
Eugenie is a director at London's Hauser & Wirth art gallery, and Brooksbank owns a wine wholesale business and is European brand manager for Casamigos Tequila, which was co-founded by U.S. actor George Clooney. 
Security around Windsor was tight, with airport-style security checks and large numbers of police. As Eugenie does not carry out official royal duties, republicans have said it is wrong that the estimated 2 million pound ($2.6 million) security bill will be paid by taxpayers. 
Writing in the Times newspaper, commentator Matthew Bell said the grandeur of the wedding showed Prince Andrew's desire to cement his family's royal status.
""When it is all over, Eugenie will continue to live with an identity experienced by a tiny minority: as a fully fledged princess, gawped at, envied and scrutinized by all,"" Bell wrote.

""Yet as the years roll by, and her royal status diminishes, as a peripheral figure of almost no consequence at all.""

A meeting in the Taliban's Qatar-based political office between its leaders and agency officials ended with the renewal of a pact allowing the agency to continue to provide, and expand, medical aid to all parties harmed by warfare.
""The security agreement...is once again reinstated and calls on all mujahideen to grant access...and provide security for the personnel and equipment of this organization,"" the Taliban said in a statement, referring to its members.
The Taliban leadership in Doha discussed the humanitarian situation and security concerns before renewing the pledge, said Andrea Catta Preta, the ICRC's spokeswoman in the Afghan capital. 
""We told the Taliban leaders about our support to all prisoners in Afghanistan jails, we explained our medical programs,"" she added. ""Finally, we reached an understanding.""
In August, the Taliban had accused the Red Cross of failing to provide adequate medical aid to prisoners on a hunger strike in Kabul's Pul-e Charkhi prison and withdrew the security cover.
The decision forced the ICRC to suspend several emergency programs in Afghanistan, where it has had a presence for three decades and about 1,000 staff. Last year it scaled back operations after attacks killed seven of its staff.

The ICRC treats all parties harmed by warfare and does not take sides. It operates in Taliban-controlled areas with guarantees of safety and helps to repatriate bodies from both sides after fighting between the militants and the Afghan army.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is hopeful that American pastor Andrew Brunson who is on trial in Turkey could be freed at a Friday court hearing, but the State Department said it was unaware of any deal with the Turkish government for his release.
NBC News and The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the United States and Turkey had reached an agreement in which some charges against Brunson would be dropped and he would be released at the hearing or soon after.
In addition to the U.S. State Department, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at a briefing, declined to confirm any deal, but he voiced hope for Brunson's release.
""We remain hopeful that with the court proceeding tomorrow that Turkey will see its way clear and free this good man who is guilty of nothing and who has been incarcerated for several years in Turkey unjustly,"" Pence said.
""President Trump, our administration, has made it clear that we will continue to stand strong until pastor Brunson is free and back home in the U.S. with his family and his church,"" added Pence, a devout Christian who has worked to free Brunson for the last two years.
Two senior administration officials said there was no deal with Turkey for Brunson. ""We're hopeful but it's a fluid situation,"" said one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Four U.S. Senators, including Republican Lindsay Graham and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, released a joint statement saying Brunson's release would ""help improve U.S.-Turkey relations for the long-term.""
""The United States and Turkey are NATO allies and have a number of mutual concerns regarding regional security and stability,"" the senators said. ""It is time that we close this ugly chapter in our relations.""
The case against Brunson, an evangelical preacher from North Carolina who has lived in Turkey for more than 20 years, has become the flashpoint in a diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington, triggering U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Turkey and condemnation from President Donald Trump.
Brunson was jailed in October 2016 and transferred to house arrest in July. In court on Friday, the prosecution is expected to introduce two new secret witnesses, but Brunson's lawyer Cem Halavurt said their testimonies were not germane to the case. Brunson is facing terrorism charges, which he denies.
The Brunson case has grown into the biggest of several disputes between the NATO allies and has been one of the factors in a 40 percent slide in value of the Turkish lira this year. 
Late on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said releasing Brunson would be the right thing for Turkey to do. 
NBC cited sources as saying that under an agreement U.S. officials reached recently with Turkey, Brunson would be released after certain charges against him were dropped at his next court hearing.
The Post said the deal included lifting U.S. sanctions, some already imposed and others threatened. Charges against Brunson would be reduced and he would be sentenced to time served or be allowed to serve any remaining term in the United States, the Post said, citing U.S. officials and people close to the case.
The Turkish lira firmed on the report.
Despite pressure from the Trump administration, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has insisted that he has no sway over the judiciary and that the courts will decide on Brunson's fate. 
A Turkish official declined to comment on the deal, citing the ongoing judicial process.
The American pastor is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. Brunson has denied the accusation - as has Gulen - and Washington has demanded his immediate release. Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999.

Brunson faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted.

Bolsonaro rode a wave of anger over years of graft, rising violence and a weak economy to take a strong lead in Sunday's first-round vote, winning 46 percent of votes. Many expect him to beat leftist Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party, in the Oct. 28 run-off. 
But despite his strong showing at the ballot box, polls show Bolsonaro is disliked by large swathes of the electorate. During his nearly three decades as a federal congressman, the former army captain alienated many voters with violent, misogynistic and homophobic comments.
Those concerns have increased since last weekend's election due to a growing list of attacks, allegedly by his supporters, against political opponents, and by his antipathy toward the press, which he labeled ""trash"" in a Twitter post on Thursday. 
Shortly after the tweet, Bolsonaro struck a more conciliatory tone, seeking to appeal to centrist voters and denying he was from the ""extreme right."" He also pledged to respect the freedom of a press he has regularly criticized as treating him unfairly, while denouncing acts of violence that critics say have been committed in his name.
""Members of the press, or maybe I should say 'friends,' ... we're going to guarantee the freedom of the press. We're not going to have any of that business of media control,"" he told a room full of reporters and party supporters in Rio de Janeiro, in his first public news conference since the vote.
""We want for you to really be independent, and be responsible in everything that you write,"" he added.
But when it was the turn of a female reporter from Brazil's respected Folha de S.Paulo newspaper to ask a question, she was hissed and booed by Bolsonaro's supporters, prompting Social Liberal Party (PSL) leader Gustavo Bebianno to wade in and remind them of their commitment to a free press. 
Bolsonaro has increasingly eschewed Brazil's mainstream media in recent weeks, speaking directly to his supporters via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live, or through cozy interviews with friendly TV networks that echo similar communication strategies used by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Bolsonaro on Thursday reiterated his admiration for Trump. But he said he had not met with the U.S. leader's former adviser Steve Bannon, who appeared with Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, during the campaign. 
Regarding the aggressions allegedly carried out by his fans, Bolsonaro said he had zero tolerance. 

""If by any chance it was somebody who voted for me, I reject that sort of vote. They committed a crime, they'll have to pay,"" he said. ""My people are not disseminating hate.""

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",China opposes Malaysia's release of 11 Uighur Muslims,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday that it resolutely opposed Malaysia's decision to release 11 ethnic Uighur Muslims from detention and send them to Turkey, disregarding China's request to hand them to Beijing. 
China was in the process of verifying details with Malaysia and hoped that the Southeast Asian nation would ""attach great importance"" to its concerns, China's Foreign Ministry said in a faxed statement to Reuters.
""These people are all Chinese nationals. We resolutely oppose them being deported to a third country,"" it said. 
Prosecutors in Muslim-majority Malaysia dropped charges against the Uighurs on humanitarian grounds and they arrived in Turkey after flying out of Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, their lawyer, Fahmi Moin, said on Thursday.
The Malaysian government has yet to comment on the matter. 
The Uighurs in Malaysia were part of a group of more than 200 detained in Thailand in 2014.
Although they identified themselves as Turkish citizens and asked to be sent to Turkey, more than 100 were forcibly returned to China in July 2015, sparking international condemnation.
The Uighurs were detained and charged with illegally entering Malaysia after breaking out of the Thai prison last November by punching holes in a prison wall and using blankets as ladders.
Malaysia's move is likely to strain ties with China, already tested since Mahathir Mohamad became prime minister after a stunning election victory in May and canceled more than $20 billion worth of projects awarded to Chinese companies. 
In February, Reuters reported that Malaysia was under great pressure from China to deport the men there, citing sources. Some Western missions sought to dissuade it from sending them to China, which has been accused of persecuting Uighurs.
Beijing accuses separatist extremists among the Uighur minority of plotting attacks on China's Han majority in the restive far western region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
China has been accused of rights abuses in Xinjiang, torture of Uighur detainees and tight controls on their religion and culture. It denies wrongdoing.
In February, Malaysia said it was considering China's request to extradite the 11 men. In the past, it has sent some detained Uighurs to China. 
Their detention came as Malaysia drew closer to China under former prime minister Najib Razak, but 93-year-old Mahathir, in his second stint as premier, has been vocal in backing Muslim communities against persecution. 
In its statement on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry said it was against illegal immigration in any form.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Japan's Abe pursues China thaw as U.S-Beijing ties in deep freeze,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - While U.S. President Donald Trump appears to wage a trade ""Cold War"" on China, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will promote a thaw with Beijing at a summit this month where business ties will be in the spotlight.
A tough line on China helped Abe to regain office in 2012 during a row over tiny East China Sea isles that put ties in a deep chill. Now, Abe hopes to build on a rapprochement welcomed by Beijing, which is locked in an escalating trade war with Washington.
Japan shares U.S. concerns about Beijing's maritime assertiveness and is extending its military reach to counter China. Japanese firms worry also about Chinese violations of intellectual property rights and technology theft.
Still, business ties with China, the world's second largest economy, are vital for Japan.
""To ensure that Japan has sustainable economic growth, you cannot ignore economic relations with China,"" said a Japanese foreign ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Abe has met Chinese President Xi Jinping many times since their first chilly conversation in 2014 on the sidelines of an Asia leaders' summit in Beijing.
Abe's Oct. 26 meeting with Xi, officially confirmed on Friday, will be the first full-scale Sino-Japanese summit since 2011. Both sides hope more mutual visits will follow.
The thaw has been linked to a shift in Beijing's diplomacy since late 2017 and increasing U.S.-China friction over trade.
SHIFTING WINDS
Japanese firms want to see ties normalized so they can compete with U.S. and European rivals.
An executive at automaker Toyota, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the mood had changed from the ""China risk"" theme of the past few years. ""The sentiment...is shifting very fast, leading to more for us to do in China,"" he said. 
China is Japan's biggest trading partner. Japan is China's second largest trading partner, after the United States, and fourth biggest investor.
Japan's direct investment in China rose in 2017 for the first time in five years, a trend that continued in the first eight months of 2018, the Japan External Trade Organization said in a report that also flagged growing Japanese exports to China.
A highlight of Abe's visit is expected to be a forum attended by up to 1,000 executives and trade officials to discuss China-Japan economic cooperation in third countries.
China expects Abe to make a relatively supportive statement on its Belt and Road initiative, a vehicle to fund and build global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries.
""We really hope that Japan on this issue is not in vicious competition with China,"" said Wang Yiwei of Renmin University in Beijing. ""It could be positive competition or even cooperation.""
Belt and Road has come under fire for saddling poor nations with unsustainable debt through big projects that are not economically viable. Beijing rejects the criticism. 
Japanese participation could help Belt and Road's image and allay the fears of debtor nations, experts and officials said.
Abe may, however, shun the Belt and Road label.
Japanese defense officials are wary of its military implications, and Tokyo is pushing its Free and Open Pacific Strategy to promote free trade and infrastructure across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Japan wants to ensure joint projects with China are transparent, open, economically viable and fiscally sound for debtor countries, officials said.
""This is not 'support' for Belt and Road. We will not ease global standards,"" a Japanese trade official said.
Several non-binding agreements, known as MOUs, are expected from the forum, including one on a project in Thailand, a Japanese source involved in the forum planning said.
Such agreements ""would be a symbol of improving ties,"" said Koji Sako, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""POISON PILL""
Japan is involved in efforts to forge a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership among 16 nations including China, as well as in talks on a China-Japan-South Korea free trade pact.
Tokyo would thus balk at the sort of ""poison pill"" found in a new U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade pact, Japanese officials said.
The provision effectively gives Washington veto power over any free trade deal with China. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said they might seek a similar clause with other countries.
Abe and Trump have agreed to start talks on a new Japan-U.S. trade deal that Washington hopes will cut its trade deficit, while Tokyo aims to avert higher tariffs on its auto exports.
""I can't imagine a situation in which we'd accept such a course,"" said another Japanese government source when asked about the poison pill provision.
The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment when asked about the coming Abe-Xi summit.
A U.S. push to get Japan to join efforts to isolate China would present Tokyo with a dilemma, although officials said Abe could tell Trump that Japan was taking a different approach with the same goal - convincing China to play by global rules.
Such U.S. pressure could find support inside Japan.
Many conservative politicians are deeply wary of China, as are many Japanese voters. A survey published on Thursday showed 86 percent of Japanese had a ""bad image"" of China.
""There are some in Japan who think the security relationship with the United States takes precedence over Japan's economic issues,"" said Kiyoyuki Seguchi, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies.

""But if one...asks whether economic development is possible without cooperative development with China, the answer is 'No'.""

The landslide, which followed heavy rains, struck Bukalasi, situated on the slopes of Mount Elgon, on Thursday afternoon. 
""Most of the people were caught at the market, the landslide pushed huge boulders into a river which burst its banks and the water swept away the people,"" said Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness and Management Martin Owor.
A picture tweeted by Uganda Red Cross showed uprooted and twisted trees. The aid agency said both ""animals and people were swept away in this disaster.""
Relief teams were combing the area to search and rescue survivors, Owor said.
""There are people who were displaced and they need shelter, food and all other support and we're moving that relief to the area,"" he said. 
The rainy season in that part of Uganda, about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital Kampala and close to the Kenyan border, runs from September to December.
An avalanche in the same area in 2010 killed at least 80 people.
Large swaths on the slopes of Ugandan mountains have been denuded of their forests and other vegetation cover for cultivable land, increasing the risk of landslides. 
Officials have previously said there were plans to move people away from some of the most vulnerable areas, but those relocations have yet to be carried out. 
Many of the East African country's mountainous regions, also including areas in the southwest and west near the borders with Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo, often experience landslides at this time of the year if rains are unusually heavy.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 04:44AM ET</span>","North Korea intends to abolish all nuclear weapons, South says","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un intends to abolish all nuclear weapons, materials and facilities to achieve ""complete"" denuclearization, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who held his third summit with Kim last month, said on Friday.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work towards denuclearization at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specifics. Negotiations have made little headway since, with the North refusing to declare its nuclear weapons and facilities or agree to a concrete timeline. 
Moon emphasized Kim's resolve to abandon nuclear and missile programs, that the North pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and focus on the economy if regime security is guaranteed. 
""By complete denuclearization, he meant to start by stopping additional nuclear and missile tests, and then abolish the facilities that produce the nukes and develop the missiles, and all the existing nuclear weapons and materials,"" Moon said, according to a script of his interview with BBC shared by his office. 
After his third summit in Pyongyang, Moon said the North was ready to invite international experts to watch the dismantling of a key missile site and would close the main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took reciprocal actions.
The actions could include putting a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, opening of a U.S. liaison office in North Korea, humanitarian aid and an exchange of economic experts, Moon said.
Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. 
And when the North makes substantial progress in denuclearization, a gradual easing of economic sanctions Pyongyang should be ""seriously considered,"" Moon said.
The United States has insisted on irreversible steps towards denuclearization first.
""MATTER OF TIME""
""Ending the war is a sort of a political declaration to terminate the longstanding hostile relationship between the United States and North Korea, and it would kick off peace negotiations depending on the denuclearization process,"" Moon said. 
""There is consensus between South Korea and the United States that it is desirable to make the end-of-war declaration at an earliest possible date, so I think it's a matter of time but it will definitely happen.""
His comments come amid U.S. concerns that inter-Korean relations may be warming too fast relative to negotiations to dismantle North Korea's weapons programs.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has expressed ""discontent"" with an inter-Korean military pact reached during last month's summit in a rare sign of disagreement between the allies. 
The two Koreas agreed in that accord to halt military drills, set up a no-fly zone near the border and gradually remove landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarised Zone, among other steps.
Moon also said Pyongyang and Washington were in working-level discussions to arrange a second summit as soon as the U.S. midterm elections are over. 
Trump said on Tuesday his second summit with Kim would be held after the elections slated for Nov. 6. It remains unclear what steps the United States plans to take towards denuclearization ""of the Korean peninsula"", a reference North Korea has used in the past to include the U.S. nuclear umbrella in the region.
Seoul's Unification Ministry said on Friday the two Koreas would hold high-level talks on Monday at the border village of Panmunjom. 

At last month's meeting, Moon and Kim agreed to resume economic cooperation, including relinking railways and roads and reopening a joint factory park and tours to the North's Mount Kumgang resort, when conditions are met.

Bulgarian Severin Krasimirov, 20, who was arrested in Germany, has agreed to an expedited procedure, meaning he should be sent to Bulgaria to stand trial within 10 days, the prosecutor said.
Marinova's brutal murder has triggered a debate over the extent of press freedom in the Balkan country and the rights of journalists to pursue investigative reporting.
The statement said Krasimirov denied intending to kill her, raping her or robbing her.
He admitted hitting a woman who he did not know in a park on the banks of the Danube in the Bulgarian city of Ruse and then throwing her in a bush while under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

Hundreds of people were expected to attend a funeral service for 30-year-old Marinova in her hometown of Ruse on Friday.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 03:51AM ET</span>","Pik Botha, global face of South Africa's apartheid state, dies at 86","By Ed Stoddard
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Pik Botha, who became the global face of South Africa's reviled apartheid government as Pretoria's minister of foreign affairs, has died aged 86 after a lengthy illness, the eNCA news network reported on Friday, citing his son.
By turns urbane and jovial, Botha, foreign minister from 1977 until the end of white rule in 1994, was seen as a reformer in the hard-line National Party administrations he served under.
In 1986 he predicted that South Africa might one day have a black president, a statement that earned him a stern rebuke from President P.W. Botha, who was no relation.
""As long as we can agree in a suitable way on the protection of minority rights without a racial sting ... then it would possibly become unavoidable that in future you might have a black president of this country,"" he said. 
Botha had the unenviable job of defending apartheid on the world stage as South Africa grew increasingly isolated, facing economic sanctions abroad while imposing a state of emergency at home and attempting to destabilize its African neighbors.
The Cold War provided the backdrop, as several countries in the region such as Angola and Mozambique allied themselves with Moscow, while Pretoria tried to portray itself as a bulwark against communist expansion. 
Regarded as a skilled behind-the-scenes negotiator who loosened adversaries up over rounds of drinks, Botha's accomplishments included securing a peace protocol that ended South Africa's military involvement in Angola, where Cuban troops had been sent to defend the Marxist government. 
That in turn helped pave the way for the independence of Namibia 1990, which also had an apartheid-style government and had been under South African administration for decades. 
After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Botha served as minister of minerals and energy for two years in a government of national unity.

""South Africa is quite far advanced due to the combined effort of both blacks and whites; that they need each other. I used to say we are like a zebra: if you put a bullet into the black stripe or the white stripe, the animal will die,"" he was quoted as saying in 1997, after he left the government.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",WhatsApp hits the road with skits to stamp out fake news in India,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
JAIPUR, India (Reuters) - On a hot morning in India's tourist mecca of Jaipur, an open truck painted in the signature lime-green colors of Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service pulls into a dusty lane, where five men spill out and begin to perform a skit. 
The event is part of a major grassroots effort by WhatsApp to battle fake news, which has triggered numerous lynchings in a country where 200 million people use the service, more than anywhere else in the world.
The actors soon draw a crowd as the play unveils how spreading misinformation online can stir up mob violence, especially in the countryside, where caste and religious prejudices run deep.
""Our society is better than theirs and that's why you should hate them,"" says one, citing one example of an incendiary text circulating on WhatsApp in India. ""If you are truly one of us, spread this message."" 
Such texts, pictures and videos aim to sow discord, warns another, as the viewers in the capital of India's western desert state of Rajasthan are then told how to identify forwarded messages and use WhatsApp responsibly.
The drive follows intense government pressure for both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp to fight fake news and rumor-mongering that have led to more than 30 deaths in about 70 lynching attempts since Jan. 2017, data portal IndiaSpend says.
The campaign is not entirely altruistic. It is being run in conjunction with Reliance Jio, the fast-growing telecom carrier controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani that recently made WhatsApp available on its $20 JioPhone.
Instructions on how to install and use the app on the JioPhone, which has connected tens of millions of low-income Indians to the Internet for the first time, are also a part of the 10-city roadshow.
Hundreds of people from WhatsApp and Jio are helping drive the campaign, with some WhatsApp employees having flown in from California, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, adding that the company did not reveal financial details. A source familiar with the matter said the costs were mostly being paid by WhatsApp.
POLITICAL HEAT
WhatsApp's efforts to battle fake news in India include a limit on forwarded messages in a market where more users pass around messages, photographs and videos than any other.
It has launched newspaper and radio campaigns and tied up with Delhi-based non-profit Digital Empowerment Foundation to develop a digital literacy curriculum for India.
The company is also training police and law enforcement officials to use WhatsApp in helping them do their jobs. 
""Our goal is to drive one of the largest coordinated public education efforts on misinformation to date anywhere in the world,"" WhatsApp said.
India's technology minister has demanded the company do more, including working out how to trace the origin of ""sinister"" messages. But WhatsApp says it will not take such steps, which would require it to weaken encryption and other privacy protections. 
It is not clear how much the public information campaigns will change people's behavior. But in Jaipur, at least some of the messages seem to be getting through.
""I learnt how to quit a WhatsApp group created by strangers,"" said Bhawani Singh Rathore, a 35-year-old teacher, who began using the service just months ago and attended.

""And I also learned how to identify a forwarded message and to not send it ahead without checking its accuracy,"" he told Reuters.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - After more than a decade as allies, two of Ivory Coast's largest political parties face off in local elections on Saturday after an acrimonious divorce that is making Ivorians nervous ahead of a presidential poll in 2020.
The alliance struck in 2005 between President Alassane Ouattara's RDR and former President Henri Konan Bedie's PDCI was meant to dominate for generations and help heal the political rifts that led to civil war three years earlier.
But the pact that propelled Ouattara to presidential election victories in 2010 and 2015 collapsed last month as the parties bickered over whose candidate should be in pole position next time round.
Now, both the RDR (Rassemblement des Republicains) and PDCI (Parti Democratique de la Cote d'Ivoire) are casting Saturday's vote for hundreds of mayors and regional council seats as a test of strength heading into 2020.
""Two years from the presidential election, this will allow us ... to see how each political camp measures up,"" said Mamadou Toure, a government and RDR spokesman.
The local election campaign has been mostly smooth. 
Residents flocked to rallies on dusty soccer fields to see candidates tout their achievements and, sometimes, hand out envelopes stuffed with cash. But some voters said the coalition split had heightened their concerns about a return to violence.
And the recriminations are starting. Ouattara's supporters have accused the PDCI of reverting to the tribal politics of Ivory Coast's blood-soaked past. The PDCI says Ouattara's government is drifting toward authoritarianism.
""The split doesn't suit us,"" Laminata Bane, a vendor outside an election rally in the economic capital Abidjan, said above the blare of pop music. ""We don't want violence. We don't dare imagine that it's even possible."" 
At stake is the stability of francophone West Africa's largest economy and the world's biggest cocoa producer, which is still recovering from a short civil war that led to Ouattara's victory in 2010 over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo being confirmed.
BUSINESS BOOMING
Under Ouattara, a 76-year-old former central banker and senior International Monetary Fund official, economic growth has averaged more than 8 percent since 2012, trendy shopping centers have proliferated across Abidjan and investment has poured into agriculture and infrastructure.
Analysts say foreign investors such as agri-business giant Cargill or French conglomerate Bollore are keeping close tabs on the political situation, but there is little evidence they are cutting back on investment.
In twin votes of confidence, the African Development Bank returned its headquarters to Abidjan in 2014 after moving to Tunisia when the first civil war broke out, and a U.N. peacekeeping mission withdrew last year.
Still, progress remains fragile. New business registrations rose 18 percent in the first half of this year but they had slumped in 2017 amid a series of army mutinies that raised concerns about long-term stability. 
The mutinies have stopped for now following multi-million dollar payments and buyouts that have cut the size of the army.
But less bullish observers say mutinies, the vast stocks of weapons unaccounted for after years of conflict and social discontent over only meager improvements in living standards are all potential flashpoints.
They also say a falling out between Ouattara and Bedie, who served as president from 1993 until he was overthrown in a 1999 coup, was perhaps inevitable.
As president in the 1990s, Bedie, now 84, championed ""Ivoirite"", an ethnically-tinged definition of Ivorian identity that led Ouattara being excluded from presidential elections in 1995 and 2000, won by Bedie and Gbagbo respectively.
Ouattara's family ties straddle the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali and the notion that some residents from the north of Ivory Coast were not true Ivorians was one of the grievances that sparked the first civil war in 2002.
The political split this time comes amid accusations of broken promises.
The RHDP (Rassemblement des Houphouëtistes pour la Démocratie et la Paix) alliance had intended to field a single candidate in 2020, all but guaranteeing victory since the RDR and PDCI are two of the three main parties in Ivory Coast. 
But the PDCI then accused the RDR of reneging on a promise to support its candidate in 2020. The RDR denied it had ever promised as much.
'RETREAT TO TRIBALISM'
Since the breakup, RDR officials have accused the PDCI of again stoking ethnic divisions. After Bedie delivered a combative speech last month to 500 Baoule chiefs in his home town, an RDR official accused him of ""a retreat to tribalism"".
""We have experienced the consequences of Ivoirite: interminable political crises with their corollaries of thousands of deaths,"" Joel N'Guessan, an RDR vice president, said in a statement.
In another speech to supporters on Monday, Bedie accused the government of trying to sow discord within the PDCI by backing challenges to the leadership by dissident members. The PDCI, ""cannot accept the lawlessness that this authoritarian regime wants to promote in this country"", he said.
Further complicating the picture for 2020 is uncertainty over who will represent the RDR. Ouattara has served the two terms mandated by the constitution and Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly and Guillaume Soro, head of the National Assembly and former rebel leader, have been cited as potential successors.
But Ouattara said in June that a new constitution approved in 2016 cancels out the previous constitution's term limits and gives him the right to stand again. 
RDR spokesman Mamadou Toure said Ouattara did not intend to run but he might reconsider if long-time rivals Bedie and Gbagbo, who is on trial in The Hague for alleged crimes against humanity during the 2010-11 war, were to stand - or if the stability of the country were threatened.
Ouattara has acknowledged the concerns about the 2020 elections both within the business community and among foreign envoys based in the country. 

""I want to assure you ... that the 2020 election will take place in excellent conditions,"" he told business executives last month. ""I will personally see to it.""

The majority of the population in the South Pacific island nation live subsistence lives and luxury cars are few and far between on its roads which often require 4WD vehicles.
Photographs of the luxury cars being unloaded from an aircraft which flew them out from Italy and reports the government had bought the Maserati fleet prompted social media outrage on Friday.
""While Papua New Guinea struggles to pay teachers and deal with a polio outbreak, the government has purchased a fleet of luxury Maserati sedans for APEC leaders,"" tweeted Liz.
Keith Jackson, who tweets regularly on Papua New Guinea issues, said: ""It's said Nero fiddled while Rome burned. But the...government buys 40 million kina Maseratis, showing to what extent #PNG leaders anchored in the bubble of Port Moresby have abandoned their people.""
Seeking to placate the anger, the Minister for APEC Justin Tkatchenko said: ""Maserati Quattroporte sedans have been secured and delivered, and are committed to being paid for by the private sector"".
""Having vehicles paid for by the private sector is the smartest way to have use of the vehicles at APEC at no overall cost to the state,"" said in an emailed statement.
Despite insisting the cars would be sold after being used to transport leaders such as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the arrival of the fleet of luxury cars comes as PNG struggles to rebuild after a devastating earthquake and an outbreak of polio.

Australia, PNG's largest aid donor, said on Thursday it would donate A$6 million ($4.27 million) to the Pacific nation to assist with the containing the outbreak.

Nugroho conceded that Indonesia's preparedness for disasters and capacity to respond still fall woefully short, not least because public funding is so low. He said the country's disaster response budget is currently 4 trillion rupiah ($262 million) a year, equivalent to 0.002 percent of the state budget. 
""We should not forget that there will be many disasters to come. It needs budget,"" he said. ""We need to learn from Japan as they are consistent in preparation.""
Critics say that, despite improvements at a national level in disaster management since a devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, local authorities often lack know-how and equipment, and so rescue efforts are delayed until the military can reach the area.
Also, a lack of education and safety drills means people don't know how to protect themselves when an earthquake strikes.
Palu was Indonesia's second earthquake disaster of 2018. In August, the island of Lombok was rocked by quakes that flattened villages and killed more than 500 people.
It was also only the latest in a string of deadly tsunamis to hit the archipelago in 2005, 2006 and 2010. But none of those compare with the 2004 tsunami that killed some 226,000 people in 13 countries, more than 120,000 of them in Indonesia alone.
Indonesia straddles the southwestern reaches of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is practically defined by the tectonic plates that grind below its lush islands and blue seas.
The archipelago is strung out along a fault line under the Indian Ocean off its west coast. Others run northwards in the Western Pacific, including those under Sulawesi. 
Volcanoes that dot the islands have brought fiery destruction and remarkable fertility, but rapid population growth over recent decades means that many more people are now living in hazardous areas.

'NEW SCIENCE'
The biggest - and most unexpected - killer in Sulawesi was soil liquefaction, a phenomenon where intense tremors cause saturated sand and silt to take on the characteristics of a liquid.
The liquefaction swallowed up entire neighborhoods of Palu.
With communications and power down, rescuers focused first on Palu's tsunami-battered beachfront in the north and on collapsed hotels and shopping centers in its business district.
Roads to the south, where the city has spread out as it has grown, were initially impassable - damaged or blocked by debris.
So it took days for rescuers to reach the neighborhoods of Balaroa, Petobo, and Sigi, where traumatized survivors said the ground came alive when the quake hit, swallowing up people, vehicles and thousands of homes.
Liquefaction is a fairly common characteristic of high-magnitude earthquakes, but the Indonesian government says there is still insufficient understanding of the phenomenon and how to reduce exposure to it. 
""Liquefaction is a new science. There are no guidelines on how to handle it,"" Antonius Ratdomopurbo, secretary of the Geological Agency at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, told reporters this week.
'EDUCATION'
A tsunami warning system set up after 2004 failed to save lives in Sulawesi: it emerged too late that, due to neglect or vandalism, a network of 22 buoys connected to seabed sensors had been inoperable since 2012.
With power and communications knocked out in Palu, there was no hope of warning people through text messages or sirens that tsunami waves of up to six meters (20 feet) were racing towards the city.
But that highlights what some experts say is the most important lesson: No one in a coastal area should wait for a warning if they feel a big quake.
""The earthquake is the warning,"" said Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""It's about education.""
Unlike in quake-prone Japan and New Zealand, earthquake education and drills are only sporadic in Indonesia, so there is little public awareness of how to respond.
""The problem in tsunami early warning systems is not the structure ... but the culture in our communities,"" said Nugroho.
That culture includes a resilience that emerged within days as the people of Palu picked up the pieces of their lives.
""Palu is not dead,"" is daubed on a billboard by the beach.
Eko Joko, his wife and two children have been salvaging wood and metal to reconstruct their flattened beachfront shop-house.
""I tell my family they have to be strong, not scared, so that I can be strong,"" said Joko, 41. 
""This disaster has not destroyed us.""

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Five Eyes intelligence alliance builds coalition to counter China,"By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - The five nations in the world's leading intelligence-sharing network have been exchanging classified information on China's foreign activities with other like-minded countries since the start of the year, seven officials in four capitals said.
The increased cooperation by the Five Eyes alliance - grouping Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - with countries such as Germany and Japan is a sign of a broadening international front against Chinese influence operations and investments. 
Some of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, said the enhanced cooperation amounted to an informal expansion of the Five Eyes group on the specific issue of foreign interference. 
While China has been the main focus, discussions have also touched on Russia, several said.
""Consultations with our allies, with like-minded partners, on how to respond to China's assertive international strategy have been frequent and are gathering momentum,"" a U.S. official told Reuters. ""What might have started as ad hoc discussions are now leading to more detailed consultations on best practices and further opportunities for cooperation.""
All the governments involved, including Germany and Japan, declined to comment. 
China, faced with a growing backlash from Washington, Canberra and other capitals, has rejected accusations that it is seeking to influence foreign governments and that its investments are politically driven.
The enhanced coordination by the Five Eyes network suggests that, despite signals from U.S. President Donald Trump that he is prepared to go it alone in the confrontation with China, members of his administration are working hard behind the scenes to put together an informal coalition to counter Beijing.
It also represents another blow to China's fading hopes of convincing European countries, unsettled by Trump's ""America First"" policies, to distance themselves from Washington and move closer to Beijing.
""BELOW THE RADAR""
The officials who spoke to Reuters said the talks have been taking place ""below the radar"" and mainly bilaterally. Two sources said France was also involved, but on a less regular and comprehensive basis.
None suggested that Germany, Japan or other nations outside the Five Eyes network had been invited to meetings of the intelligence alliance, which was set up after World War Two to counter Soviet influence.
But a statement issued after a Five Eyes meeting on the Gold Coast of Australia in late August hinted at closer coordination. It said the group would use ""global partnerships"" and accelerate the sharing of information on foreign interference activities.
International coordination has accelerated in parallel with a wave of national measures to limit Chinese investments in sensitive technology companies and counter what some governments view as a growing campaign, under President Xi Jinping, to sway foreign governments and societies in China's favor through a mix of pressure and inducements.
Last December, citing concerns about Chinese influence, the Australian government unveiled a package of new laws that tightened rules on foreign lobbying and political donations, while broadening the definition of treason and espionage.
The United States has pushed through a law, known as FIRRMA, which gives Washington new powers to block certain types of foreign investments.
The text of that legislation mandates Trump to conduct a ""more robust international outreach effort"" to convince allies to adopt similar protections.
Earlier this month, in a scathing attack on China's foreign activities, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Beijing of interfering in the domestic arena by ""rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists and local, state and federal officials."" Beijing has denied the charges.
""A NEW WORLD""
The German government, which tightened its rules on foreign investments last year only to determine months later, after a fresh wave of Chinese acquisitions, that they were still inadequate, is poised to lower the threshold at which it can intervene.
Last year, Berlin quietly launched an inter-ministerial drive to assess the broad range of Chinese activities in the country. Government sources say that analysis is broadly complete and new policy measures could follow, although they say far-reaching steps like those taken by Australia are unlikely.
The U.S. official said the foiled takeover of German semiconductor firm Aixtron in 2016 had underscored the need to build a broader coalition of countries to share information and coordinate responses to China.
Two years ago, the German government approved a Chinese investment fund's acquisition of Aixtron, only to reverse course a month later when U.S. officials raised security concerns that Berlin had overlooked.
The officials who spoke with Reuters described a ""flurry of consultations"" in recent months, with Washington driving coordination on the investment side and Canberra taking a lead role in raising awareness about political interference.
Talks have taken place between diplomats, intelligence officials and heads of government, they said.
""We are living in a new world,"" said a person from a Five Eyes country who has traveled extensively to other capitals over the past year to discuss China's foreign activities.

""The sudden shock from authoritarian regimes is prompting closer coordination and a real expansion of intelligence sharing,"" this person said.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2018 12:56AM ET</span>",Maduro says Trump administration wants to have him killed,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the Trump administration on Thursday of seeking to assassinate him, as relations strain between the ideologically opposed nations. 
Asked about Maduro's comments, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council said: ""U.S. policy preference for a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela remains unchanged.""
Venezuela's opposition says Maduro lobs ludicrous accusations at enemies to deflect from his own incompetence.
Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled the ailing oil-rich nation since 2015, driven out by brutal food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. 
Washington has imposed sanctions on Venezuela, denouncing Maduro as a dictator who has quashed human rights and triggered an economic meltdown.
The White House accused Maduro's government on Wednesday of involvement in the death of a jailed Venezuelan politician whom authorities say killed himself but whom opposition parties say was murdered. 
Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, said in a televised broadcast on Thursday night the United States had asked the government in neighboring Colombia to kill him. 
""They have given the order from the White House that Maduro be killed,"" said Maduro, flanked by workers. He vowed that ""they will not even touch a single hair of mine."" 
Maduro did not give an explanation for his accusations and did not provide any evidence. Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for further information. 

Maduro contends that he is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by U.S.-backed adversaries. He denies limiting political freedoms, insisting that Washington-supported opposition leaders have plotted assassination attempts and sought to overthrow him through violent street protests.

President Rodrigo Duterte said he asked ambassador Teodoro Locsin to replace Alan Peter Cayetano, who planned to seek a seat in the lower house of Congress. Cayetano was a three-term congressman and a two-term senator before he joined the cabinet last year.
""Can you please call Teddy Boy Locsin and ask him if I can mention his name here,"" Duterte said to an aide during a news conference in Manila.
Locsin, a former three-term congressman and a newspaper publisher, tweeted later on Friday: ""I was asked. I said yes.""
Candidates began registering on Thursday for the mid-term elections scheduled for May 2019 and seen as a referendum on Duterte's administration.
Five more cabinet members are expected to quit and run for elective positions, including the ministers for agriculture and agrarian reform, a political adviser and a special assistant. 
Duterte's press spokesman Harry Roque is also leaving to run for public office next year, the president's office said. Roque was replaced by the president's lawyer, Salvador Panelo.

NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - Media companies are pulling out of a Saudi investment conference because of growing outrage over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist in Turkey.
Economist Editor-In-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes will not participate in the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, spokeswoman Lauren Hackett said in an email.
Andrew Ross Sorkin, a CNBC anchor and  New York Times  business journalist, tweeted that he was not attending the conference, saying he was ""terribly distressed by the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and reports of his murder.""
Pressure has mounted on Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policies, went missing. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
The New York Times Co (N:NYT) has also decided to pull out of the event as a media sponsor, spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said. 
The Financial Times said in a statement that it was reviewing its involvement as a media partner.
Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement he won't attend the FII conference in Riyadh unless substantially different set of facts emerge. 
Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) CEO Bob Bakish, who was slated to speak at the conference, has decided to not attend the event, company spokesman Justin Dini said.
Other media companies slated to appear at the conference include CNN and Bloomberg, according to the event's website.
The disappearance of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote columns for the Washington Post, has cast a shadow over the three-day conference known as ""Davos in the desert,"" which is scheduled to begin on Oct. 23. The Post is owned by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.
The event attracted some of the world's business elite including Wall Street's top bosses and executives from multinational media, tech and financial services companies.
Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate where he went to get documents for his planned marriage. Riyadh has said the claims are baseless. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to speak, as is Mastercard Inc (N:MA) CEO Ajay Banga. Representatives for both companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Another billionaire, Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, also decided to distance himself from Saudi Arabia, saying he would no longer attend the event.
""In light of recent events, I have decided to put my plans on hold, pending further information regarding Jamal Khashoggi."" Case tweeted https://twitter.com/SteveCase/status/1050527146991648768.
Khashoggi's disappearance has led officials and business leaders to drop out of another one of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's large projects.
On Wednesday, former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said that he had suspended his role on the board of Saudi Arabia's planned mega business zone NEOM until more is known about what happened.
Moniz was named on Tuesday as one of 18 people advising the $500 billion NEOM project. The Crown Prince said last week that the NEOM business zone would build two to three towns each year starting in 2020 and be completed by 2025.
The Harbour Group, a Washington firm that has been advising Saudi Arabia since April 2017, ended its $80,000 a month on Thursday. ""We have terminated the relationship,"" managing director Richard Mintz said.

British billionaire Richard Branson said on Thursday that his Virgin Group would suspend its discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures, in light of events involving Khashoggi.

PORT ST. JOE, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescuers searched for survivors in the rubble of ravaged beach communities on Thursday after Michael, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, slammed into the Florida Panhandle, causing widespread flooding and killing at least seven people.
Michael struck Florida's northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 kph), pushing a wall of seawater inland.
The storm tore entire neighborhoods apart, reducing homes and businesses to piles of wood and siding, damaging roads and leaving scenes of devastation that resembled the aftermath of a carpet-bombing operation. 
U.S. Army personnel used heavy equipment to push a path through debris in Mexico Beach to allow rescuers through to search for trapped residents, survivors or casualties, as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead. Rescuers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency used dogs, drones and GPS in the search.[L2N1WR22R]
""We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,"" said Stephanie Palmer, a FEMA firefighter and rescuer from Coral Springs, Florida.
Much of downtown Port St. Joe, 12 miles (19 km) east of Mexico Beach, was flooded after Michael snapped boats in two and hurled a large ship onto the shore, residents said. 
""We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they’re on the other,” said Mayor Bo Patterson, who watched trees fly by his window as he rode out the storm in his home seven blocks from the beach. Patterson estimated 1,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed in his town of 3,500 people.
""There were mandatory evacuation orders, but only idiots like us stuck around,"" said Jordon Tood, 31, a charter boat captain in Port St. Joe. ""This was my sixth (hurricane), so I thought I was prepared.""
CHECKING DOOR TO DOOR
At Jinks Middle School in Panama City, the storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off a wall. A year ago, the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.
""I have had employees going to the communities where our kids live, going door to door and checking,"" said Principal Britt Smith by phone. ""I have been up since 3:30 or 4 a.m. emailing and checking on staff to see if they are safe. So far, everybody seems to be very safe.""
With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, a measure of a hurricane's force, Michael was the third strongest storm on record to hit the continental United States, behind only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys. 
It weakened overnight to a tropical storm. 
Fast-moving Michael, a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale when it came ashore, was about 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT), with top sustained winds of 50 miles (80 kph) as it headed for the Atlantic coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. 
It was still toppling trees with 50-mph (80-kph) winds and bringing life-threatening flash flooding to areas of Georgia and Virginia, still recovering from Hurricane Florence as it marched northeast.
Parts of Virginia were struck with heavy rains and flash flooding, said Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the state Department of Emergency Management. Early on Friday, the center of the storm was set to drift past Virginia Beach back into the Atlantic Ocean, he said.
At least seven people were killed in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina from falling trees and other hurricane-related incidents, according to state officials.
Emergency services carried out dozens of rescues of people caught in swiftly moving floodwaters in North Carolina.
Many of the injured in Florida were taken to hard-hit Panama City, 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Mexico Beach. Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center was treating some, but the hospital evacuated 130 patients as it faced challenges running on generators after the storm knocked out power, ripped off part of its roof and smashed windows, according to a spokesman for the hospital's owner, HCA Healthcare Inc (N:HCA).
DAMAGE TO CROPS
Almost 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power from Florida to Virginia on Thursday because of the storm. 
The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. 
Brad Rippey, a meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department, said Michael severely damaged cotton, timber, pecans and peanuts, causing estimated liabilities as high as $1.9 billion and affecting up to 3.7 million crop acres (1.5 million hectares).

Michael also disrupted energy operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it approached land, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly one-third as offshore platforms were evacuated.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>","In race to parliament, Malaysia's Anwar faces down critics","By Joseph Sipalan
PORT DICKSON, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim faces the first test of his return to political life on Saturday, in a by-election that would pave his way to claiming the premiership, as promised by prime minister and former foe Mahathir Mohamad.
Anwar, who is expected to win, needs a strong mandate in the fight in the coastal seat of Port Dickson to counter criticism that he is in a hurry to take over from the 93-year-old Mahathir, just five months after being released from prison.
""A bigger margin will give the by-election the appearance of a coronation, something Anwar has been awaiting for 20 years,"" said Adib Zalkapli, an analyst with political risk consulting firm Vriens & Partners.
""If he wins by a smaller margin, he may be seen as merely riding on the popularity of Mahathir, without winning new support to the coalition.""
Mahathir led the Pakatan Harapan, or Alliance of Hope, coalition to a shock victory in a general election in May, unseating his former protege Najib Razak and ending the 61-year rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition.
Their campaign focused on corruption concerns triggered by a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), over which Najib and his wife face investigation.
Anwar could not contest as he was in jail on a 2015 sodomy conviction, but his renewed partnership with Mahathir was key to the election win, after which Mahathir secured a royal pardon for Anwar.
The pair have had an acrimonious relationship over two decades sparked when Mahathir, during his previous tenure as prime minister, sacked Anwar as his deputy in 1998. A year later, Anwar was convicted of corruption and sodomy.
Anwar and his supporters maintain that all the charges were trumped up to end his political career.
On Saturday, Anwar faces a motley crew of six contenders, among them his former aide Saiful Bukhari Azlan - whose sodomy accusations against Anwar led to a second jail term for the former deputy prime minister.
Saiful said he was contesting to stop Anwar from becoming prime minister.
""All this is not about the people. It's about his personal agenda to become prime minister,"" Saiful told Reuters.
Another candidate, Stevie Chan, who has built up a large domestic following on social network Twitter, has also said he was contesting to take a stand against ""political entitlement and arrogance"".
But 74 percent of survey respondents would still vote for Anwar, a poll by Institut Darul Ehsan, a think tank set up by Selangor state, which is ruled by his Pakatan coalition, showed. 
Anwar has kept up a break-neck campaign, supported by ruling coalition leaders, showcasing the charisma that jumpstarted the Reformasi, or Reform, movement after he was sacked in 1998.
Even Mahathir made an appearance, joining Anwar on stage for the first time in 20 years at a mega-rally on Monday.
Mahathir was the right man to lead the country ""in the current situation"", Anwar told the rally, in a response to critics who question his ambitions.

""I say this with all humility. I know him, love him as a father and a leader. I fought against him, and now accept he is the best man to lead Malaysia now,"" he said, to thunderous applause from thousands of supporters.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 09:19PM ET</span>",Trump wary of halting Saudi weapons sales over missing journalist,"By Jeff Mason and Stephen Kalin
WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he saw no reason to cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, possibly setting up a clash with the U.S. Congress.
Trump also said the United States may be closer to finding out what happened to Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policies who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Turkish sources have said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the building and his body removed, allegations that Riyadh dismisses as baseless.
In a sign Turkey and Saudi Arabia might be looking for a way forward, Turkey accepted a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to investigate the case, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency quoted presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin as saying.
The Washington Post, citing unidentified U.S. and Turkish officials, reported that Turkey had told U.S. officials it has audio and video recordings that prove Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. It was not clear that U.S. officials had seen the footage or heard the audio, the Post reported, but Turkish officials have described the recordings to them.
Turkish investigators were prepared to enter the consulate, a Turkish security official told Reuters, but were awaiting final authorization from the Saudis.
Speaking to reporters, Trump said he saw no reason to block Saudi purchases of U.S. arms or its investments in the United States despite the journalist's case, saying the Gulf nation would just move its money into Russia and China.
""They're spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that create jobs ... for this country. I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States, because you know what they're going to do? They're going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else,"" he said.
His comments prompted pushback from members of the U.S. Senate, including from some of his fellow Republicans, many of whom signed a letter on Wednesday forcing his administration to investigate Khashoggi's disappearance and paving the way to possible sanctions on Saudi officials.
""If it's found that they murdered a journalist, that will hugely change our relationship,"" Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. ""There will have to be significant sanctions placed at the highest levels.""
The Khashoggi incident might make it very hard for the Trump administration to win congressional approval for arms sales to the Saudis. Many lawmakers, including some Republicans, have already questioned U.S. support for Saudi's involvement in Yemen's civil war, which has prompted a humanitarian crisis.
Under U.S. law, major foreign sales of military equipment can be blocked by Congress. There is also an informal process in which key lawmakers can put ""holds"" on arm sales.
Trump, who sealed a $110 billion deal for U.S. companies to sell arms to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as president in May 2017, said Washington was looking into the disappearance.
""We're looking at it very strongly,"" he said. 
Separately, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman said the Saudi ambassador to Washington was heading back to the kingdom and the United States had told him, ""We expect information upon his return.""
U.S. INVESTIGATORS IN TURKEY?
Global pressure mounted on Saudi Arabia. British billionaire Richard Branson said his Virgin Group would suspend its discussions with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in the group's space ventures, while a number of media companies pulled out a planned Saudi investment conference.
The New York Times said it would no longer be a sponsor of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. Economist Editor-In-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes and CNBC anchor and New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin both decided they would no longer attend. 
U.S. technology investor Steve Case said he was putting his plans to speak at the conference and attend a separate meeting on a Saudi tourism project on hold ""pending further information"" on Khashoggi.
In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the United States was working with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, adding, ""We have investigators over there.""
However, three U.S. law enforcement sources said that because Khashoggi is not an American citizen and disappeared outside the country, the FBI has no automatic jurisdiction to get involved in the case and could only become involved if requested by a foreign government such as Turkey.
Senior U.S. officials, including Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, have spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the disappearance.
Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign stop as president but in recent weeks has appeared to sour a bit on Riyadh, complaining about the cost of American support for the Saudi military and about oil price increases.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his country was worried about Khashoggi's disappearance.
""We are investigating all aspects of the event. It is not possible for us to remain silent regarding such an occurrence, because it is not a common occurrence,"" he said in comments quoted by Hurriyet newspaper on Thursday.
He also questioned Saudi assertions that the consulate does not have footage of Khashoggi leaving because the mission's security cameras only provide live footage and do not record images.

""Is it possible for there to be no camera systems at the Saudi Arabia consulate, where the event took place?,"" he said.

Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the SPD each saw their voter share fall by 3 percentage points, to 26 and 15 percent respectively, the DeutschlandTrend survey for broadcaster ARD showed.
They were the monthly survey's weakest ever figures for the coalition parties, ARD said.
The poll also relegated the SPD to fourth place, behind the pro-immigration Greens, up 3 percentage points on 17 percent, and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, unchanged on 16 percent.
The results chime with expectations that the CSU, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU, is heading for its worst showing in a state election in over 60 years on Sunday, a setback that risks widening divisions within the coalition. 
Since it took office in March it has twice come close to collapsing, due to arguments over immigration and a scandal over accusations of far-right sympathies against Germany's former domestic spymaster.

KIEV/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Ukraine secured approval on Thursday to establish an independent church in what Kiev says is a vital step against Russian meddling in its affairs, but the Russian clergy fiercely opposes the biggest split in Christianity for a thousand years.
At a three-day synod presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, seat of the global spiritual leader of roughly 300 million Orthodox Christians, endorsed Ukraine's request for an ""autocephalous"" (independent) church.
The synod will ""proceed to the granting of Autocephaly to the Church of Ukraine,"" a statement said.
The synod took several decisions to pave the way for Ukraine to set up its church, including rehabilitating a Ukrainian patriarch excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church for leading a breakaway church in the early 1990s. 
In retaliation, the Russian Orthodox Church said it would break eucharistical relations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman as saying. 
The tussle over Ukraine's spiritual future flows from the poisoning of relations between Kiev and Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine's east that has killed over 10,000 people.
Ukraine accuses the Russian Orthodox Church of wielding a pernicious influence on its soil, allowing itself to be used as a tool of the Kremlin to justify Russian expansionism and support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. 
Ukraine's victory on the church issue could bolster pro-Western President Petro Poroshenko's campaign in what is expected to be a tight election race next year.
""The decisions of the Ecumenical Patriarch and Synod finally dispelled the imperial illusions and chauvinistic fantasies of Moscow,"" Poroshenko said. ""It is a question of our independence, national security, statehood, a question of world geopolitics.""
The Russian Orthodox Church has compared Ukraine's moves for independence to the Great Schism of 1054 that split western and eastern Christianity, and warned they could lead to an irreversible rupture in the global Orthodox community. 
On Thursday, its spokesman said Istanbul had ""crossed a red line"" by reversing the excommunication of Patriarch Filaret. Filaret hopes to lead the independent church.The Kremlin also voiced its displeasure, saying it opposed anything leading to a split in the Orthodox faith.
Filaret told reporters that Thursday's decision paved the way for Ukraine to merge its three main Orthodox church branches into the new independent entity. 
HOPES FOR PEACE
Ukraine and Russia trace their Orthodox Christian roots to Volodymyr the Great, the prince whose baptism in 988 in Kiev led to the christianisation of the region known as the ""Kievan Rus"".
The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, earlier dominated in Ukraine but has been challenged by a rival known as the Kiev Patriarchate formed after the 1991 break-up of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union. 
Led by Filaret, the Kiev Patriarchate has championed an independent Ukrainian church and Ukraine's closer integration with the West. He is an outspoken critic of Russia's political leadership, charging that Vladimir Putin is possessed by Satan.
The Moscow Patriarchate denies its church is a security threat to Ukraine and, far from being a Kremlin stooge, says it has done much to promote peace in the country's east. 
The Russian Orthodox Church has attacked Ukraine's bid for independence as a gambit by Poroshenko to shore up his flagging popularity. It calls the Kiev Patriarchate illegitimate and its spokesman warned that the split would lead to a ""tragic and possibly irretrievable schism of the whole Orthodoxy"". 
In retaliation for the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's support for Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church decided last month to stop participating in structures chaired by the patriarch and would no longer commemorate him in his services. 
It has threatened to go one step further by no longer recognizing him as the first among equals in the Orthodox world.

Asked about Russian warnings that the church split could lead to violence in Ukraine, Kurt Volker, Washington's ambassador to the Ukraine conflict, said on Thursday: ""I hope there are not protests and violence orchestrated as a result of this decision. I think it would be tragic to see that.""

Foreign navies generally prefer northern Haifa as their Israeli port of call, so the destroyer USS Ross's arrival at Ashdod potentially signaled Washington's interest in broadened berthing options for its Mediterranean Sixth Fleet.
""This visit has significance. It symbolizes the deep alliance between Israel and the United States,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking from the deck of the USS Ross, together with his wife and the U.S. ambassador to Israel.
""We are determined to defend ourselves against the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria,"" Netanyahu said. ""President Trump gave full support to this policy of ours, and the fact that this destroyer is visiting here today is an expression of that support.""
Netanyahu and his wife toured the ship, shaking hands with officers and sailors, and then took part in a ceremony onboard.
U.S. Sixth Fleet spokesman Commander Kyle Raines said in a statement to Reuters the port visit ""reinforces the strong and enduring partnership between our two nations"".
Both Haifa and Ashdod face shelling threats - the former, from Hezbollah rockets in Lebanon and the latter from Palestinian rockets from the Gaza Strip.

In his statement, Raines did not refer to any such threat specifically, but said: ""We conduct extensive analysis of all port facilities and communities where our ships pull into and have the ability to adjust our force protection measures as necessary to ensure the safety of our sailors.""

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Croats protest against election of moderate in Bosnia's presidency,"MOSTAR, Bosnia (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators waving Croatian flags took to the streets of Mostar on Thursday to protest against the election of a moderate politician as the Croat member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, saying he did not represent them.
The protests came four days after elections dominated by nationalist campaigning by the main Bosnia's Serb, Muslim and Croat parties - and highlighted the tensions now swirling around efforts to form a government.
A coalition led by the Croat nationalist party HDZ won the most votes of Croats in the Federation parliament and in the majority Croat cantons. However, its leader Dragan Covic lost the seat in the presidency to Zeljko Komsic, seen as a more moderate figure.
Members of Thursday's crowd, some of whom arrived from other majority-Croat towns in Bosnia, told reporters they did not have any particular political affiliation. 
But many said Komsic had only won because of the votes of Muslim Bosniaks - an assertion made by Covic after the vote.
Carrying placards with the slogan ""Not My President"", they walked from the university in the Croat-held part of the ethnically-divided southern town to the presidency branch office, where they lit candles for what they said was a 'dying democracy' in the Balkan country. 
Komsic, a Croat who advocates a multi-ethnic Bosnia and has already served two terms in the country's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, won with a high margin over Covic, who has campaigned on the creation of a separate Croat-run region within Bosnia.
LOOMING CRISIS?
The solid grip of ethnic parties has frustrated efforts to reform the economy and win Bosnia admission to Western organizations such as the European Union and NATO.
Under a peace deal that ended its 1992-95 war, Bosnia is split in two autonomous regions, the Federation dominated by Croats and Bosniaks and the Serb-dominated Serb Republic.
While the citizens in the Serb Republic can only vote for a Serb presidency member, citizens in the Federation can cast their ballots for Croat or Bosniak candidates alike.
Preliminary election results showed that Komsic secured support in majority Bosniak areas.
His election stirred angry reactions in neighboring Croatia, whose Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic has said it was not good ""that one people choose a representative of the other people"". [nL8N1WO3GI]
After conceding defeat to Komsic on the election night, Covic said that his election may cause an ""unprecedented crisis"".
He was referring to the absence of election rules for the formation of the Federation parliament's upper house, after Croat and Bosniak parties had failed to agree before the vote on how to change the election law in accordance to a ruling by a top court.

The Croats are the smallest of Bosnia's three ethnic groups and feel endangered by majority Bosniaks, who on the other hand fear that Croat nationalists may try split the country further along ethnic lines.

Pavlopoulos, who met Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Athens, said that such demands fell under the framework of ""resistance against those who want to return to a nightmarish past"", hinting at the rise of the far-right in Europe ahead of EU elections. 
""We consider Greece's demands over the occupation loan and war reparations legally active and judicially claimable,"" Pavlopoulos said. 
Germany has apologized for Nazi-era crimes during the war but has said it is not willing to discuss reparations. It has denied owing anything to Greece for World War Two since it paid Athens the sum of 115 million deutschmarks in 1960. 
Hitler's forces occupied Greece in 1941-1944 and extracted a so-called ""occupation loan"" used to help finance its campaign in North Africa. Runaway inflation followed, and tens of thousands of people starved to death. 
Greece was forced to hand over 476 million reichmarks, which Greek officials have estimated at 6-10 billion euros ($6.95-11.5 billion) today. 
World War Two reparations resurfaced as an emotional issue during Greece's 2010-18 period of bailouts when austerity-hit Greeks, evoking past injustices, blamed their biggest creditor Germany for painful cuts associated with three international bailouts.
During World War Two, about a thousand Greek villages were razed and tens of thousands of people killed in reprisals by German troops trying to crush the Greek resistance, which had liberated large areas of the country.
Steinmeier visited the site of a Nazi concentration camp in the Athens suburb of Haidari where hundreds perished. ""We honor these dead, and above all, apologize,"" the German president said during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a briefing on Wednesday: ""We think that the issue of German reparations has been finally settled legally and politically. The Greek government has not yet officially pushed for them.""
Tsipras said that Steinmeier's visit was a chance for a fresh start in bilateral relations, but added: ""Of course, this doesn't mean that we must forget or that we can sweep any of our differences from the distant past under the carpet.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola outbreak is expected to last several months and could spread to Uganda or Rwanda, which are well prepared but have not approved use of a vaccine, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.
The most concerning area is the city of Beni in Congo's North Kivu province where dozens of people who may have been exposed to the deadly disease are hiding from health workers, emergency response chief Peter Salama said. 
""We anticipate that now we’ll be looking at least another 3-4 months in order to really stem this outbreak, with a strong focus in Beni and surrounding areas,"" Salama said. ""I’d say that’s the best case scenario.""
The outbreak has caused 194 cases and 122 deaths. Two-thirds of cases in the past month have been in and around Beni, where the Ebola response was disrupted last month by attacks by armed groups and a period of official mourning.
The next few days will tell if the wave of infections in Beni is over, Salama said, depending on the security situation and the local community's willingness to support the response.
""If, however, this peak is accompanied by a peak in insecurity which limits our ability to get to all these cases and their contacts, then we could see a much larger wave building. A lot is depending on that security situation,"" Salama said.
In the latest attack, the United Nations said four civilians were killed near Beni on Tuesday.
Many of the new cases are known to health workers as people with potential exposure to Ebola. Salama said 80-90 percent of such people were being monitored. But around 40 or more are ""actively avoiding follow-up,"" increasing the risk of the disease spreading, he said. More than 90 percent of those people were in Beni, he said.
Some Ebola victims are suspicious of health workers, fearing that hospitalization is a death sentence - despite the obvious risks of missing out on treatment - while some families insist on conducting traditional burials, which can spread the virus.
Local authorities in Beni have threatened people who harbor suspected patients with three-month jail sentences.
Salama said Uganda and Rwanda could see Ebola cases but both were well prepared for a rapid response. However, neither had approved the vaccine, which could be given pre-emptively to health workers and ""within hours"" to people at risk from any confirmed case.

Ebola has no known cure, but four treatments have been given to 66 patients, which Salama described as ""a big breakthrough"". With government approval, a clinical trial could start within weeks to identify the most reliable drug, he said.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Child sex abuse was rife in Scottish Catholic care homes, inquiry finds","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Violent and sexual abuse of children by priests and nuns, including beatings with crucifixes and dog leads, took place at two Catholic care homes over decades in Scotland, according to an inquiry report on Thursday.
The report, the first chapter of a wider investigation led by Supreme court judge Lady Anne Smith, examined residential care for children by the order of the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul between 1917 and 1981 - particularly the Smyllum Park Orphanage in Lanark, central Scotland and Bellevue Children's Home near Glasgow.
At Smyllum, children were sexually abused by priests, a trainee priest, nuns, members of staff and a volunteer, the report found. 
""For many children who were in Smyllum and Bellevue, the homes were places of fear, coercive control, threat, excessive discipline and emotional, physical and sexual abuse, where they found no love, no compassion, no dignity and no comfort,"" Smith said in her summary of the findings.
Based on evidence from 51 witnesses and 21 written statements, the report detailed beatings with straps, rosary beads, wooden crucifixes and dog leads. 
The wider Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry was set up three years ago and is currently examining allegations of abuse at 86 institutions.
The Roman Catholic Church has been at the center of sexual abuse scandals worldwide for years, many involving children, which were covered up by senior members of the clergy.
For some children at the Scottish homes, beatings were ""a normal aspect of daily life,"" where punishment for bed-wetting was to stand before other children with the wet sheets over their heads, the report said.
Those who did not eat would be force-fed, even as they were vomiting the food back.
An emailed statement from The Daughters of Charity said the findings described ""events and practices which are totally out of keeping with the fundamental values which underpin our life and mission.""
""We most sincerely offer our heartfelt apology to anyone who suffered any form of abuse whilst in our care,"" it added.
Bellevue House closed in 1961 and Smyllum Park closed in 1981.
Two months ago, police arrested and charged 11 women and one man in connection with the abuse of children at Smyllum.

""We have no time pressure,"" the pro-Europe minister who is stepping down at year's end told the Finanz und Wirtschaft paper in an interview published on Thursday when asked about the Oct. 15 date Brussels has set for an accord.
""European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is in office until May 2019. Of course it would be desirable to clinch a treaty before then. We still hope to find a solution this year,"" she said.
Talks have dragged on for more than four years on a treaty that Brussels demands, complicated by Britain's separate negotiations on divorce terms from the European Union and disagreement over Swiss rules to protect high wages.
Leuthard, who helped patch up rocky ties with the EU when she was Swiss president in 2016, refused to budge on labor rules that unions and small business defend as a way to keep cross-border foreign laborers like plumbers and electricians from undercutting Swiss pay.
""We accept the principle of the free movement of people (from the EU) but insist on setting national rules for working conditions,"" she said. ""We have a different social security system than Europe's... Our intention is to stay tough and count on the EU to make concessions.""
Brussels has been stepping up pressure on non-member Switzerland to agree a pact that would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120 sectoral accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules.
The treaty would also provide a more effective platform to resolve disputes. It would focus on five areas linked to the single market: the free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport, mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm goods.
Should treaty talks fail, the sectoral accords would stay in effect but bilateral relations would enter a deep freeze.
Failure to strike a deal would mean no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices.
Brussels has threatened not to extend beyond this year recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat escalation.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Final preparations were being made in the English town of Windsor on Thursday for Britain's second major royal wedding this year, this time involving Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Princess Eugenie.
Eugenie, younger daughter of the queen's third child Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, will tie the knot with Jack Brooksbank, at the monarch's Windsor Castle home on Friday.
The nuptials come just five months after the glittering wedding of Prince Harry, younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and U.S. actress wife Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, at the same location.
Eugenie, 28, ninth-in-line to the throne and a director at London's Hauser & Wirth art gallery, and Brooksbank, 32, who works in the drinks and hospitality industry, are copying some of her cousin's plans. 
The couple, who met in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier in 2010 and got engaged in Nicaragua in January, have likewise invited 1,200 people from across Britain to join in the celebrations in the castle grounds and to watch the newlyweds leave St George's Chapel after the service.
They will then take an open-top carriage ride through Windsor, although it will be shorter than the one Harry and Meghan took in May when thousands thronged the streets and hundreds of millions worldwide watched on television.
""We think we’ve been blessed this year with two royal weddings,"" said Phillip Bicknell, the local council deputy leader.
""We’re hoping she’s going to have a great day and we’re very pleased that she’s shared her day with us.""
Stars from the world of showbusiness and sport attended Harry's wedding and Buckingham Palace announced on Wednesday that one of Eugenie's bridesmaids will be Theodora Williams, the six-year-old daughter of ex ""Take That"" singer Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda Field.
Three-year-old Princess Charlotte, daughter of second-in-line to the throne Prince William and his wife Kate, will also be a bridesmaid while her brother Prince George, 5, will be a page boy. Eugenie's older sister Beatrice, 30, will be her maid of honor.
Nearly all Britain's senior royals are expected to attend although Prince Charles's wife Camilla will be absent as she has a prior engagement in Scotland. It was not certain whether the 92-year-old queen's husband Prince Philip, 97, who no longer carries out official duties, would be present.
The Dean of Windsor will officiate the ceremony while Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform during the service. Also among the guests will be the surgeon who carried out an operation to straighten Eugenie's back when she was 12, British media reported.
The ceremony will be broadcast on British TV and live streamed on the Royal Family and Prince Andrew's YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter channels.
NOT STRESSED
""I'm not stressed at all,"" Eugenie told Vogue magazine for its September issue. ""It's very nerve-wracking because you want it to be perfect but then you realize that you're going to be with the person you love forever and nothing else really matters.""
While the royal family is paying for the wedding itself, there has been disquiet among republicans and some newspapers over the security bill for the event, which has been estimated at more than 2 million pounds ($2.6 million), given that Eugenie does not carry out official royal duties.
About 38,000 people signed a petition, organized by campaign group Republic, against taxpayers' money being spent on the occasion.
""Most Brits opposed taxpayer funding of Prince Harry's wedding but as with all royal events were forced to accept it,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""But there's something different about Friday's royal wedding, and people aren't happy.""

Britain's top-selling Sun newspaper ran a front page story on Wednesday with the headline ""£2m too much for Eugenie wedding"", saying the event could have been held at a chapel near her childhood home.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - New prosecution witnesses expected to testify on Friday in the Turkish trial of a U.S. Christian pastor on terrorism charges lack relevance as their testimony will focus on incidents after Andrew Brunson's arrest, his lawyer said.
The case against Brunson, an evangelical preacher from North Carolina who has lived in Turkey for more than 20 years, has become the flashpoint in a diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington, triggering U.S. tariffs against Turkey and condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Brunson, who was jailed in October 2016 and has been under house arrest since July, is due to appear in court for the next hearing in his trial on Friday. The prosecution is expected to introduce two new secret witnesses, but Brunson's lawyer Cem Halavurt said their testimonies were not germane to the case.
One of the witnesses, called ""Sword"" by prosecutors, claimed to have seen Brunson's wife at a Christian gathering in Western Turkey, according to testimony to prosecutors published by the Hurriyet newspaper. The meeting made Sword feel ""uncomfortable"", according to the Hurriyet's account of the testimony.
""The incidents took place when my client was in jail,"" Halavurt told Reuters. ""These incidents are not relevant to my client.""
The court in Izmir, the coastal province where Brunson ran his small church, will decide whether it will hear the testimony from the new witnesses at the hearing. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that Brunson's release on Friday would be an important step and the right thing for Turkey to do.
Brunson is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. He has denied the accusation - as has Gulen - and Washington has demanded his immediate release.
Jailed or held under house arrest since October 2016, Brunson faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted. Last month the main prosecutor in his trial was replaced, a move his lawyer cautiously welcomed, saying it might be a sign of changing political will.

Despite pressure from the Trump administration, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has insisted that he has no sway over the judiciary and that the courts will decide on Brunson's fate.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>","Brexit negotiators eye Monday breakthrough, Northern Irish party ups the ante","By Conor Humphries and Gabriela Baczynska
DUBLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British and EU negotiators making headway on the Irish border hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said, though the British prime minister's Northern Ireland ally has stoked uncertainty by warning it could vote against her. 
Under pressure from all sides, Theresa May will meet some of her ministers later on Thursday to discuss Brexit, hours after her parliamentary partner, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), threatened to withdraw its support if she accepts what it called a ""draconian solution"" from the European Union.
The DUP's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said the party's 10 members of parliament would vote against the UK budget and consider voting no-confidence in May if the British government breaks the DUP's red lines in Brexit talks.
""In breaking her promises she would be agreeing to break up the United Kingdom,"" Wilson said.
The DUP vehemently opposes any checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain after Brexit, which is due in March and would be the United Kingdom's biggest trade and foreign policy shift for more than four decades.
But at the same time, neither side wants to upset peace on the island of Ireland by winding down the open border between the British province there and EU member state Ireland. That will become the only land border between the UK and the bloc. 
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday rammed home that - while the bloc was looking at ways to carry out checks on many goods away from the actual frontier - animal and animal products would have to be screened on the border.
May has said she wants ""frictionless"" trade with the EU after Brexit to help safeguard Britain's economy while regaining full sovereignty. Her spokeswoman said on Thursday London would present further proposals, which she described as ""regulatory aspects"", for the backstop border arrangement ""in due course"". 
""HEADWAY""
Agreeing on how to maintain an open Irish border after Brexit is the key hurdle now to sealing a divorce deal between the EU and Britain. While London wants to regulate that by a future trade deal with the EU, the bloc insists on an emergency fix in case negotiating new relations takes longer, or fails.
Both sides have made positive signals in recent days though also indicated they were still short of a deal, which would define the divorce terms and include an EU declaration stating that it would seek the closest possible ties with Britain after Brexit ranging from trade to security to research. 
""We are not there yet. There is no breakthrough - yet,"" Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman for the EU's executive European Commission, told a news briefing on Thursday.
Still, diplomatic sources on both sides of the talks told Reuters that ""it was going well"" and that Brexit negotiators locked away in Brussels this week were ""making headway"" specifically on the Irish issue. 
They said tentative planning could see a breakthrough announced on Monday when EU negotiators representing the bloc's national leaders meet in Brussels without Britain. Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, could also come to Brussels then if weekend talks cover enough ground.
Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, some other British officials have voiced more caution, saying ""big issues"" still lie in the way of any agreement.
The 27 states remaining in the bloc hope to announce ""decisive progress"" in divorce talks at an EU summit next week and then finalize their offer of close future ties with Britain next month. 
PRESSURE ON MAY
As that departure date creeps closer, pressure on May from various directions is intensifying.
After meetings in Brussels earlier this week, the DUP issued a series of terse warnings to May over the compromise that is in the making between the EU and British negotiators.
""She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the government tries to bribe, bully or browbeat us into accepting it,"" Wilson also said.
By withdrawing its support, the DUP could make it difficult for May to pass legislation through parliament, including the budget which will be voted on later this month. 
In May's own Conservative party, some euroskeptic lawmakers want to vote against her approach to exiting the EU as it would not bring a sharp enough break from the bloc in their view.
The parliamentary arithmetic is difficult for May who commands a majority of only 13 lawmakers including the DUP. She needs to keep either her own party onside or attract votes from the main opposition Labour Party.
Labour demands that Britain retain ""the exact same"" perks it now has within the EU's customs union and single market - something May's so-called Chequers plan does not meet and which the EU rules out since London decided to leave both. 

Former Labour leader Tony Blair added his voice to calls to vote down any Brexit deal by May, hoping that would open the way for another referendum in which Britons would this time decide to stay, after their popular vote in June 2016 that resulted in a narrow ""Leave"" victory.

He also said a Bolsonaro government would push ahead with the massive Belo Monte hydro dam on the Xingú river, a tributary of the Amazon, which was criticized for displacing indigenous communities. Shelved plans for other dams in the Amazon basin could also be revived.
Ferreira said private investors would be called on to help build the infrastructure Brazil needs and that environmental factors would be fully taken into account. 
Belo Monte and other hydro plans for the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest, have been slammed by environmentalists for harming its biodiversity.
Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former army captain-turned-congressman favored by financial markets, fell just short of an outright majority in Sunday's election. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, in a second-round ballot on Oct. 28.
Popular with Brazil's powerful evangelical and farming lobby, Bolsonaro has pledged to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement climate deal due to disagreements over how the Amazon should be protected.
His top agriculture adviser told Reuters on Tuesday that his government would slash fines for farmers who break environmental laws in sensitive areas like the Amazon rainforest.
Ferreira said hundreds of unfinished infrastructure projects, from railways and roads for exporting grains, will be studied and completed if viable with the help of investors through public-private partnerships.
But energy will be a priority.
""If Brazil is to return to the rates of growth that we all want, there will be a need for energy that cannot be supplied from other sources,"" he said in an interview late on Wednesday.
GROWING SUPPORT
A Datafolha poll on Wednesday showed Bolsonaro strengthening his lead to 58 percent of voter support, compared with Haddad's 42 percent.
Bolsonaro, who is recovering from a near-fatal stabbing while campaigning last month, plans to rally the support of elected lawmakers on Friday near his home in the Barra de Tijuca beach district of Rio de Janeiro.
In an interview posted late on Wednesday to social media, Bolsonaro said his team had an economic agenda ""practically ready"" to present upon taking office in January, if he wins, including a tax reform that would not raise taxes but rather cut red tape.
Ferreira said Bolsonaro favored privatizing the transmission and distribution units of Brazil's largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras, but retaining state control of power generation.
He emphasized that a Bolsonaro administration will focus on ""clean"" energy from hydro to wind and solar, and that environmental concerns will be given ""full attention.""
Ferreira struck a less moderate tone in an interview published on Thursday by newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, where he described environmental regulators as a nuisance.
When the army was responsible for opening up roads in the Amazon during the 1964-1985 military regime, trees could be felled without permission, but today to cut down one tree ""a handful of people will come and bother you,"" he told the paper.

Environmentalists are most concerned with Bolsonaro's plans to stop recognizing new native reservation lands and to merge the agriculture and environment ministries under the control of a farm lobby representative.

Wednesday's nuptials of Tsahi Halevi, an Arabic-fluent Jewish actor, and Lucy Aharish, a Muslim anchor on a top Hebrew news show, followed a four-year romance that, friends said, they had kept secret to avoid falling foul of cultural sensitivities.
""We Are Signing a Peace Accord,"" the couple joked on their wedding invitation, quoted by the Israel Hayom newspaper.
The decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict has often fed tensions between Israel's majority Jews and the 20 percent Arab minority. According to the most recent national marriage data available, for 2015, just 23 out of some 58,000 weddings were between Arabs and Jews.
Israel's best-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth wished bride and groom ""Mabrouk"" - Arabic for ""congratulations"" - on its front page, writing the word in Hebrew transliteration. 
But the marriage was rued by Arye Deri, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who serves as Israeli interior minister, a role that oversees the country's population registry.
""It's their own private affair. But, as a Jew, I have to tell you that I'm against such things because we must preserve the Jewish people,"" Deri said in an interview on Israel's Army Radio. ""(Their) children will grow up, go to school and later want to get married, and then they'll face difficult problems.""
Both bride and groom have had public brushes with geopolitics.

Halevi is a former undercover commando in the Palestinian territories - a role he re-enacted for the hit Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series ""Fauda"". Aharish had complained, in media interviews, of suffering discrimination in Israel as well as pressure from her family over the prospect of her marrying outside of Islam.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A trip by Pope Francis to North Korea is ""a dream that can be realized"" and would be a gigantic step toward peace on the Korean peninsula, a senior South Korean bishop said on Thursday.
The bishop, Lazarus You Heung-sik of Daejeon, spoke ahead of a meeting next week in the Vatican between Francis and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who will be carrying an invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to visit Pyongyang.
""If the pope goes there, it will be a gigantic step, a qualitative step for the Korean peninsula, for its pacification,"" said You, who was in Rome for a meeting of bishops from around the world known as a synod. 
""North Korea could enter the world community as a normal country. I know how much the pope, on various occasions, has called for pacification on the Korean peninsula,"" You told a news conference.
Kim told Moon of his wish to meet the pope during a meeting last month, South Korea's presidential office said on Tuesday. [L4N1WP2AI] The pope is expected to visit Japan next year. 
Moon, who will be on a tour of Europe, will meet the pope on Oct. 18. The day before, Moon will attend a special ""Mass for Peace"" on the Korean peninsula in St. Peter's Basilica.
""I think the pope will now listen to my president about the situation,"" the bishop told reporters on the sidelines of the news conference.
""NO PRIESTS"" IN NORTH KOREA
You, who said he has entered North Korea on humanitarian visits, said there were no priests there and the country needed religious freedom.
""I am not talking about conditions (for the visit). But before you do something you have to do the groundwork. When the groundwork is done, the pope can go,"" he said.
North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as long as it does not undermine the state. But beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship, no open religious activity is allowed.
North Korea, which Church officials estimated had a Catholic community of about 55,000 just before the 1950-53 Korean War, does not allow priests to be permanently stationed in the country.
Information about how many Catholics are still in North Korea is scarce. Religious agencies have said they number in the few hundreds to about 4,000.
""A seed grows,"" the bishop said about a possible papal visit to the north. ""We need to pray and we will see what God wants. I am convinced that when that day comes it will be a dream that can be realized.""
The two Koreas have held three summits this year. Kim held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, and pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

""Last year, everybody was talking about war in the North. This year the situation has changed 180 degrees .. I think that North Korea is ready to open up, renounce nuclear weapons and build a new country,"" he said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party on Thursday denied receiving corrupt funds after the brother of its deputy leader was accused in a central bank investigation of benefiting from fraud at a local bank.
A report commissioned by the central bank and published on Wednesday found at least 1.9 billion rand ($130 million) had been siphoned illegally from VBS, a failed local bank that bailed out former president Jacob Zuma after a corruption scandal.
One of the beneficiaries was Brian Shivambu, who received 16 million rand of ""looted"" funds from VBS, the report said. Reuters could not reach Brian Shivambu for comment.
Brian Shivambu is the younger brother of EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu, the party's chairman Dali Mpofu told television station ENCA.
Mpofu denied the central bank investigation implicated anyone in the party. 
""There is no way the EFF got money from VBS. That I can say categorically,"" Mpofu said.
The Daily Maverick, an online news site, reported on Thursday that Floyd Shivambu and the EFF had received money from VBS via Brian Shivambu's company, citing sources.
Floyd Shivambu did not respond to an email requesting comment.
Earlier Mpofu tweeted that allegations against Floyd Shivambu were an example of ""mob justice"".
""In the ignorant Republic of The Mob you can be charged for the deeds of your relatives,"" one tweet said. 
The EFF, whose members wear red-berets, has won over many poorer black voters disillusioned with the ANC over its failure to deliver on the wealth and land re-distribution promised by Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994.
The party won more than six percent of the vote at the 2014 parliamentary election, only a year after it was formed. Polls suggest the EFF could double its share of the vote at next year's election, mainly at the expense of the ANC.
The EFF, led by expelled former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, has focused much of its energy on attacking senior ANC members for using their positions to corruptly enrich themselves and their families.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 10:43AM ET</span>",Bosnian Muslim wartime commander charged with crimes against Serbs,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnian Muslim wartime commander Atif Dudakovic and 16 senior members of his unit were charged on Thursday with carrying out atrocities against Serbs in western Bosnia during the 1992-95 war.
The 65-year-old was also charged with war crimes against fellow Muslims who were members of, or supported, a rival faction in the area during the conflict, Bosnia's state prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
Dudaković has regularly dismissed all the accusations as politically motivated. 
Bosnia has been ruled by Serb, Croat and Muslim nationalist parties for the most part since the end of the war in which more than 100,000 died. It remains deeply divided along ethnic lines and steps toward reconciliation have been small.
Dudaković was a general in the Bosnian Muslim-dominated army who commanded the 5th Corps operating in the Bihac enclave, which was surrounded and besieged by the Bosnian Serb forces from 1991-1995. 
After the war, he served as the general commander of the army in Bosnia's autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, which was later merged in the country-wide armed forces. 
""The defendants are accused of the murder of more than 300 Serbs, most of them civilians, mainly elderly, as well as soldiers who had surrendered or were detained,"" the statement said.
The prosecutors said that bodies of a number of the victims were found in several mass and individual graves after the war, while the search for the others was still under the way.
Part of the indictment refers to crimes committed against Muslims led by renegade leader Fikret Abdic, who had set up a breakaway province around the western town of Velika Kladusa.
Abdic himself was jailed for 20 years in 2002 for war crimes against Muslims loyal to the Bosnian government by a court in Croatia, which later reduced his prison term to 15 years and released him in 2012. 
Dudakovic and another 11 members of his Corps were arrested in April on war crimes charges but were later released with restrictions on their movement. 

The prosecutors said they will invite 447 witnesses and present more than 1,100 documents as evidence. Bosnia's state court needs to confirm the indictment.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Rebel Afghan militia leader defies government as arrest bid fails,"By Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - A standoff over a militia commander in central Afghanistan who has defied attempts to arrest him has highlighted tensions over President Ashraf Ghani's crackdown on local strongmen operating outside central government control.
On Friday, security forces arrived in Lal Sar Jangal, a district in the remote and largely lawless province of Ghor, to arrest Alipur, a commander from the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority accused of serious human rights abuses.
Their arrival set off a gunbattle that killed four police and eight civilians. Alipur, known as ""Commander Sword"", escaped but a few days later reappeared in Wardak province, west of Kabul, holding a defiant rally of hundreds of supporters.
""You rescued me and as long as I have your support, no government can touch me,"" Alipur, seen by supporters as a Robin Hood-style figure who defends his people, told a cheering crowd. ""I stand beside you and will defend your rights to my last day.""
Deputy interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi called Alipur a ""criminal, a highwayman and a killer"" and said: ""The government will continue to hunt him."" 
The case has echoes of Nizamuddin Qaisari, an ethnic Uzbek militia commander in northern Faryab province close to Vice President Rashid Dostum, who was also accused of serious abuses. His arrest in July set off violent protests across northern provinces.
With the Taliban dominating large parts of the countryside, the incidents underline how the government has struggled to control dozens of politically connected strongmen who have regularly been accused of extortion, murder and other abuse.
But they also highlight tensions among Afghanistan's ethnic groups that are increasingly undermining the central government, suspected by many ethnic Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks of favoring Ghani's Pashtun group.
Mohammad Mohaqeq, a powerful Hazara leader, said Alipur was ""commander of the people's uprising force"" and called the attempted arrest, ""an excuse to expand the conflict in Hazara communities"". 
DISCRIMINATION
Hazaras have long been discriminated against in Afghanistan and although the war has affected all ethnic groups, in recent years they have suffered many attacks on mosques, cultural centers and residential areas as well as being targeted on provincial highways. Many blame Sunni Pashtuns for the attacks.
A senior government official said Alipur took up arms and created a small, mainly Hazara force in Wardak years ago after several incidents in which Sunni militants stopped cars on the highway and killed Hazaras. 
In revenge, his men would stop cars and target Pashtuns, accusing them of aiding the Taliban or anti-Shi'ite militant groups, the official said.
Truckdriver Sirajuddin said Alipur's men stormed a small hotel in Behsud district some months ago. ""They beat me, called me the Taliban's brother and put me in a basement for 10 days just because I am a Pashtun,"" he said.
It was not possible to confirm the account with Alipur, whose location remains unclear following the rally in Wardak.
The government moved against Alipur just two weeks before the parliamentary elections on Oct. 20 but critics say local commanders have been allowed to operate with impunity for years as long they did not defy the government. 
The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been able to operate freely because he had the backing of powerful figures in Kabul.
""The reason why such men exist and kill and torture civilians is because they enjoy support from strongmen in the government and beyond,"" he said.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>","Special Report: A child poisoned in military housing, a family left in the dark","By Joshua Schneyer
CARVILLE, Louisiana (Reuters) - In August 2016, a National Guardsman’s year-old daughter tested high for lead exposure while living at the military post here, amid pecan groves near the Mississippi River.
Emily Price had a blood lead level slightly above the 5 microgram-per-deciliter threshold for intervention set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was lethargic and had hearing problems, said her mother, Coryn Price. Emily often refused food but would sometimes eat things off the floor. All were possible symptoms of lead poisoning, a preventable affliction that can damage children for life.
Deteriorating paint in old homes is the most common source of lead exposure, and three months earlier, the Prices had moved into a spacious duplex built in 1934. Price said she expressed concern to a post commander about paint chipping from the windowsill in Emily’s room.
“I wanted to know where the lead was coming from and stop it,” she said.
The Guard promptly had the house tested while the Prices stayed in a hotel and soon provided the family a report from a private laboratory. It showed a faux leather couch the Prices owned had tested high for the heavy metal. In October 2016, Guard staff told the family the couch was the likely culprit and they should remove it immediately, Price recalled.
The Guard, Reuters has learned, didn’t act on other crucial information: Testing it ordered from another lab in September 2016 had indicated additional lead hazards at the home. Paint chips gathered near windows contained up to 16.5 percent lead by weight – 33 times the federal hazard level for a deteriorating home paint surface, a lab report shows.
Unaware of those perils, the Prices removed the couch, and, assuming their baby was now safe, continued living in the house.
A child’s lead levels usually drop quickly after exposure ends. But four months after the couch was removed, in February 2017, Emily’s levels had skyrocketed to 32.5 micrograms per deciliter, more than six times the CDC’s action threshold, medical records show.
A state health department inspection eventually confirmed Coryn Price’s earlier suspicions: Emily’s room and three other spots harbored toxic levels of leaded dust. The yard was contaminated, too.
Only then, more than nine months after Emily first tested high, Price said, did the family learn of the home’s hazards. The Guard also had failed to disclose the potential presence of lead-based paint to the Prices in leasing documents, as federal law requires landlords to do for pre-1978 housing.
“It’s depressing for a government agency to show such callous disregard for people’s welfare,” said Patrick MacRoy, a former lead poisoning prevention program director in Chicago. “The right thing to do is inform occupants about all testing results, keep children away from any lead paint hazard found, and repair it promptly.” 
The Price family’s ordeal is among many Reuters has documented in an examination of health hazards in military housing across the United States. In August, the news agency reported https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-housing that its own lead testing had found poisoning hazards in privatized Army housing on several bases, and more than 1,050 small children tested high for lead at Army base hospitals or clinics. The results often weren’t being reported to state health authorities as required, heightening children’s risk of continued exposure.
In response to that report, the U.S. Army crafted a plan https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-cleanup-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-army-forms-plan-to-test-40000-homes-for-lead-following-reuters-report-idUSKCN1LC1ZH to test 40,000 older homes for lead across the country and remove families from those found to be unsafe. The Army has held meetings on bases worldwide to address residents’ concerns, and has vowed to comply with state health-reporting laws.
Asked about the case of Emily Price, the Louisiana National Guard provided evolving and contradictory accounts over several months.
The Guard’s spokesman, Colonel Ed Bush, initially told Reuters that Emily’s exposure hadn’t come from the military post home, speculating she could have been exposed “at Grandma’s house or daycare.” Bush said the Price family wasn’t living in the duplex when Emily’s lead levels spiked. He said the military did everything possible to protect the family, putting them up in a “lead free” hotel on post for nine months “at a much higher cost to the Guard” – $2,400 a month.
Told later that Reuters had photographs proving Emily and her family were living in the duplex all those months, Bush blamed the Prices, saying they had been ordered by the post commander to leave the home.
“Why would they go back to the duplex if they had concerns?” Bush asked.
He later said the post’s commanders hadn’t closely tracked the family’s whereabouts. “No one specifically ‘kept tabs’ on them,” Bush wrote in an email. “It was assumed they would stay in the hotel.”
Asked why the home hadn’t been repaired earlier, Bush said the Guard had been unsure how to interpret the September 2016 lab results from its own testing, considering them “inconclusive.”
“This was all very new,” Bush said, adding that the post hadn’t dealt with other lead exposure incidents.
Coryn Price says her family was never told to stay out of the duplex, where they continued to pay rent. The Prices lived a block away from the post’s commander, Colonel John Angelloz. “Everyone knew where we lived” in the little community, she said. “Nobody told us the duplex wasn’t safe.”
Colonel Angelloz declined to comment.
Bush acknowledged one failure: The Guard had not been disclosing the potential presence of lead-based paint to tenants in its older housing. It is now providing the disclosures, he said.
In response to inquiries from Reuters, the Environmental Protection Agency said it would look into the Louisiana Guard’s compliance with the disclosure rule. In the past, the EPA has fined https://archive.epa.gov/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/5d3d6abb51575ee7852579f10069ca7e.html other military housing operators for lead disclosure lapses.
RELUCTANT, THEN DETERMINED
Reuters first contacted Coryn Price last year after hearing about her daughter’s poisoning. For months, the mother of two was reluctant to talk. When Price learned of the Guard’s claim that it had moved Emily out of harm’s way, she decided to speak out.
“It didn’t happen that way,” she said.
Recently, Coryn shared her decision with other military spouses on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group. “My husband is terrified it’s going to hurt his career. But I can’t sit back and say nothing,” she wrote. “My daughter doesn’t have a voice of her own.”
Coryn’s husband, Sergeant Peter L. Price, declined to meet with a reporter or answer questions for this article. He urged her not to speak with the media, she said. He now works as a federal arms technician on another Guard post in Louisiana. The family has moved to a home of their own off post.
The U.S. National Guard operates in all 50 states and several territories. Most of its approximately 450,000 members are part-time reserve soldiers and airmen, so-called weekend warriors, who can be called into active duty by their state or the federal government. Others work for the Guard full-time. Some Guard installations include family housing.
The Louisiana Military Department operates homes at the Gillis W. Long National Guard Center here. The site is a former leprosy colony, where researchers found an effective treatment for the disfiguring disease in the 1940s. Since the 1990s, the Louisiana Guard has used the site for training, and some 220 people – Guard personnel and their families – live in its trailers and houses, including older structures built when leaded paint was widely used.
Coryn Price, 28 years old, grew up at Gillis Long. Her father, a sergeant, was posted at the base, and she lived there from the age of 14 until moving out earlier this year. She met her husband on post when he was serving as a night-shift supervisor in the military police. They married in 2013, shortly after he volunteered for deployment in Afghanistan, and a week before he shipped out. The couple has two daughters, Emily, 3, and Lizzie, 4.
Sergeant Price, 47, enlisted in the Louisiana Guard in 2008 after earlier working in wine sales in California. In Afghanistan, he served with the 1084th Transportation Company, providing truck escorts, often through dangerous territory. In May 2013, a fellow Louisiana Guardsman was killed in a vehicle near Price’s when their convoy came under enemy fire.
Coryn, now finishing a degree in psychology at Louisiana State University, became pregnant with Emily after her husband returned in 2014. He only shared his memories of the convoy attack with her years later. “It’s one of those things he talks about with people who know what it’s like” to deploy, she said.
The Prices were thrilled to move into the duplex in May 2016. They had been living in one of about 50 trailers on the post, initially meant to house families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The cramped trailers sit in a row behind a cemetery for former leprosy patients.
Coryn was alarmed by Emily’s first high lead test, and determined to find the source of her exposure. After she told command about the result, in September 2016, Guard staff collected samples at the duplex, a playground, and the Prices’ former trailer – from items such as furniture and toys, as well as paint, soil, dust and water. The household items were analyzed by a lab in Illinois, the paint and other samples in Georgia.
The next month, she said, the Guard presented her with the Illinois lab’s results indicating lead in the family’s couch. She and Peter wrapped the couch in a cover and stored it out of the children’s reach on a porch.
Bush initially told Reuters the Guard had permanently removed the Prices from the duplex immediately upon learning of Emily’s first high test. State health inspection records and photographic evidence show otherwise.
Scores of time-stamped family photos taken by Coryn show the Prices going about their daily routines in the duplex during the months after the Guard’s testing turned up leaded paint chips and soil at the home. One picture shows Emily and her older sister dressed in Halloween costumes sewn by their mother. Emily was a butterfly. Others show the girls opening presents on Christmas, in the living room beneath the decorated tree. Another the next month shows Emily brushing her sister’s hair in the master bedroom.
STARTLING RESULTS, A QUEST FOR ANSWERS
By February 2017, Emily's symptoms had worsened and she was at risk of falling off the growth chart for her age. Another blood test revealed her lead levels were the seventh-highest among more than 64,000 young children tested in Louisiana last year, according to a Reuters analysis of state health data.
Coryn was shocked. At first, she said, she thought the result was a mistake. Another test days later confirmed it. Doctors told her Emily might soon require hospitalization and chelation therapy, an aggressive course of medication to remove lead from the body.
After her pediatrician reported Emily’s poisoning to the state health department last May, a state-ordered inspection found her still living in the home. Inspectors found several lead hazards there, including on Emily’s windowsill and in the yard where she played. The state’s report says those home hazards – and not the Prices’ couch – were the likely sources of Emily’s poisoning. It recommended the Guard spend $2,100 to remediate the home.
Only then was the family moved out of the duplex permanently.
The Guard is unaware of any other lead poisoning cases in the housing at Gillis Long, Bush said. Since the Price incident, he said, the Guard has remediated potential lead hazards at the family’s former home and 13 others on post – repainting, changing household fixtures, and placing new sod in front yards.
It is too early to know how lead poisoning will affect Emily in the long run. Her lead levels fell gradually after she left the duplex but remain above the CDC’s elevated threshold.
The CDC says there is no safe level of lead in children's blood. After exposure, the toxin can be stored in the bones, and re-released into the bloodstream during growth spurts. As they age, childhood lead-poisoning victims can have learning, behavioral, reproductive and other health issues. Research has linked exposure to an increased risk of early mortality.
Now three, Emily has reached most developmental milestones on time. She is eating more. During a reporter’s visit in July, she polished off a plate of home-cooked sugar grits. But she is small for her age, and her speech is still emerging.
Doctors are recommending Emily be evaluated again at age four. Since the poisoning, the costs of her medical care have soared.
By contrast, fixing lead hazards at the Prices’ former home was inexpensive: $1,000 for new sod, $1,000 for retouching paint and cleaning, state inspectors estimated last year.

Removing Emily from the home for the repairs, they wrote, was “priceless.”

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","Bahrain to receive up to $2 billion, first slice of Gulf aid","By Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain will receive up to $2 billion from its Gulf neighbors before the end of the year as the first installment of an aid package, and some funds have already arrived in state coffers, officials said on Thursday.
Last week, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait offered a $10 billion aid package over five years (2018-2022) to avoid the risk of a debt crisis in the island kingdom, in a deal tied to fiscal reforms.
Bahrain’s finances have been hit hard by a slump in oil prices in 2014 and the small country has been struggling to cut government spending while avoiding public anger over austerity measures.
Two officials, who declined to be named, said $2 billion would arrive before the end of the year and would figure in the 2019 budget. Another $2 billion, due by the end of 2019, may also be reflected in the budget, one official added.
The funds will help the kingdom, which is holding parliamentary elections in November, as it implements new fiscal reforms, the officials said.
It also makes sense economically and politically for the three wealthy Gulf states, which are diplomatic allies of Bahrain. Any collapse of Bahrain’s currency or a credit crunch could undermine confidence throughout the region.
Bahrain released a 33-page fiscal plan last week after signing the agreement with its Gulf neighbors to fix its debt-burdened finances and abolish its budget deficit by 2022. Manama had projected a $3.5 billion budget deficit in 2018.
ELECTIONS
The plan, which promises further cuts in public spending, comes at a sensitive time as Bahrain prepares for elections, the second ballot since 2011 when protesters took to the streets demanding democratic change.
A government spokesperson confirmed that Bahrain has received some funds as part of the aid package, but declined to give details.
The spokesperson said the approval of a value-added tax law and the establishment of a national taxation body (among other measures) demonstrated the government’s commitment to “delivering swift, comprehensive reform”.
The support from other Gulf powers came after investors started doubting Manama’s ability to pay back its debt and asked for higher returns, which prompted the government to cancel a bond sale in March. 
Bahrain does not plan to issue new U.S. dollar-denominated bonds this year, a central bank official told investors on Tuesday, one source told Reuters.

The yield on Bahrain’s dollar bond due 2023 edged down 6 basis points to a seven-month low of 5.64 percent on Friday after the Gulf state announced the aid package from its neighbors.

DHAKA (Reuters) - More than 100 journalists staged a protest in Bangladesh's capital on Thursday, their faces covered in black cloth, accusing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of breach of trust in enacting a law they fear is aimed at curbing press freedom.
Hasina's government has defended the Digital Security Act, passed by parliament last month, saying it aims to control cyber crimes. 
But journalists say the law that carries prison sentences of up to 14 years for anyone trying to secretly record information inside government buildings will create a climate of fear. 
They said the government had gone back on its commitment to reconsider some of the harsh provisions. 
The Editors' Council expressed ""deep disappointment"" that a promise made by cabinet ministers in recent weeks to work toward amending the law had not been kept.
""(The council) considers this a breach of trust that it had reposed, in good faith, on the commitment made by three senior cabinet ministers,"" the group said in a statement.
Information Minister Hasanul Haq and two other ministers had promised journalists last month that their concerns over the law would be raised at the weekly cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister, the council said. 
Haq told Reuters there were other items on the agenda at recent cabinet meetings, due to which the journalists' concerns could not be discussed. ""We have told the prime minister about the concerns of the Editors' Council and we hope that in next cabinet meeting they may be raised for discussion.""
Critics see the law as Hasina's latest move to suppress freedom of speech ahead of national elections in December, when she will be seeking a third consecutive term against an opposition in disarray.
The main opposition party's leaders have been jailed this year over charges ranging from corruption to a plot to assassinate Hasina. 
The new law combines existing measures such as the much-criticized colonial-era Official Secrets Act with tough new provisions.

The Editors' Council asked that the law be amended in the last session of the parliament that starts on Oct. 21.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Thousands of Syrians stranded on Jordan's border with Syria are running out of food as routes leading to their camp are closed by the Syrian army and Jordan is blocking aid deliveries, relief workers and refugees said on Thursday.
The Syrian army has tightened its siege of the camp, in Rukban, near the northeastern Jordanian border with Syria and Iraq, preventing smugglers and traders from delivering food to its 50,000 inhabitants, mostly women and children.
""More than a week ago the Syrian regime cut all the routes of supplies towards the camp. There are now only very small amounts of food that smugglers bring,"" Abu Abdullah, the head of the civil affairs council that runs the camp, told Reuters.
""The camp is a balloon that could explode at any moment because of hunger, sickness and lack of aid ... if the situation continues like this there will be real starvation,"" he added by phone.In the last three years, tens of thousands of people have fled to the camp from Islamic State-held parts of Syria that were being targeted by Russian and U.S.-led coalition air strikes.
Rukban is located near a U.S. garrison in southeastern Syria at Tanf on the Iraqi-Syrian border. The camp falls within a so-called deconfliction zone set up by the Pentagon with the aim of shielding the Tanf garrison from attacks by pro-Assad forces.
Damascus says the U.S. forces are occupying Syrian territory and providing a safe-haven in that area for rebels it deems terrorists.
Jordan has since the start of the year blocked any aid deliveries to the camp over its frontier and says now that the Syrian government had recovered territory around the camp, it could not be made responsible for delivering aid.
LIVES AT RISK 
With Damascus intransigent, U.N. aid agencies have been pressing Jordan to let in urgent deliveries to stave off more deaths, aid workers and diplomatic sources said. 
The U.N. children's agency UNICEF warned on Thursday that without ""critical action"" by parties to the conflict to ""allow and facilitate access"" the lives of thousands of children in the camp were at risk.
""The situation for the estimated 45,000 people - among them many children - will further worsen with the cold winter months fast approaching, especially when temperatures dip below freezing point in the harsh desert conditions,"" Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director for Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement.
Already two more infants died in the last 48 hours, Cappelaere added. Relief workers inside the camp say a woman also died this week.
Jordan wants the United Nations and Russia to put pressure on Damascus to give the written authorizations needed to allow supplies into Rukban from Syrian government-held territory.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said recently that his country, already burdened with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn Syria, could not be made responsible for delivering aid to the camp.

Western diplomatic sources believe the siege of the camp is part of a Russian-backed Syrian government effort to put pressure on Washington to get out of Tanf.

Meteorologists said major downpours were a classic phenomenon at this time of year but that exceptionally warm sea water along the Mediterranean coast of southern France probably reinforced the impact.
The year so far is France's hottest since 1900, according to the state meteorological service, Meteo France, and highs topped 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, well above normal for autumn in this part of the world.
The two people reported dead by the local government office in Saint-Maxime, near the famed film-festival city of Cannes, were found by emergency-service scuba divers, in a car found rocking on its roof in shallow-water waves.
The local prefect's office in the region told people there to avoid basement garages or any other underground spaces even if the worst of the downfalls, the equivalent of one month's rain in one day, appeared to have passed.

The stormy weather in the area and Mallorca coincided with a major hurricane that killed at least one in Florida.

""He admitted he did it while drunk and heavily on drugs,"" Nadezhda Krasimirova, told NOVA TV's reporter in Germany, where she lives. ""He admitted and started to cry in front of me. He is not like that, I cannot grasp it,"" she added. 
Bulgarian prosecutors have charged Severin Krasimirov in absentia for the rape and killing and sought his extradition from Germany to stand trial in Bulgaria.
The body of the 30-year-old Marinova, a host of a regional current affairs show at a local TV station, was found dead in a park near the Danube river city port of Ruse on Saturday. Police said she had been raped, beaten and strangled. 
Her brutal killing has shocked Bulgarians and revived the debate over the extent of press freedom in the Balkan country.

There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel in the past decade and is the dominant Palestinian armed force in Gaza, where an Israeli security fence runs along the frontier.
""In the past few hours our forces have neutralised a terrorist attack tunnel belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation, which penetrated Israel from the central Gaza Strip,"" a military statement said. 
Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus told reporters on a conference call that the tunnel, which he said was the 15th detected and destroyed in the last year, ran 200 meters into Israeli territory. 
Earlier on Thursday, the army said rocket alert sirens that had sounded in Israeli communities near the border with the Gaza Strip were a false alarm. [nL8N1WR1R4]
Palestinian gunmen used tunnels to blindside Israeli forces during the 2014 Gaza war. Israel has since been developing detection technologies and laying down an underground wall which will remove the threat posed to Israel by these tunnel by 2019.
Tensions at the Israel-Gaza border have remained high after a brief eruption of fighting that included Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes ended in August. 
Palestinians have been mounting weekly protests at the border which have included attempts to breach a security fence. Israeli troops have killed at least 195 Palestinians and wounded thousands since the protests began in March, Gaza medics say, and one Israeli soldier has been killed by a Gaza sniper.
Citing security reasons, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on their borders with Gaza, a policy that has deepened economic hardship in the territory of two million Palestinians. 
The Gaza protesters have called for the blockade to be lifted and also demand a return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel's founding in 1948.
Egyptian efforts to mediate a long-term ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has so far shown little progress. 
As part of a U.N.-backed effort to alleviate hardship in Gaza, Qatar has donated fuel to provide for Gaza's power plant for six months. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this week. [nL8N1WR1R4]
Doha has also announced a $150 million emergency aid package for Gaza.

Ahmad Ali Hanash, 14, struggled to hold back tears as he recalled the friends he lost in the attack by a Saudi-led military alliance on a market in Saada in northern Yemen in August.
""Their blood will not be in vain, we will avenge them by getting an education, we will avenge them by learning,"" Hanash, who was on the bus, told Reuters. ""I thank God for surviving the attack, the ugly crime.""
As the survivors resumed their lives, joining morning exercise drills in the sand yard of the two-storey Al Falah primary school, or attending classes in wheelchairs alongside peers seated at wooden desks, other students said they feared more attacks in the war-torn country.
""We are sad after we lost our dearest schoolmates, and we are worried that the enemy will strike the school,"" said 15-year-old Sadiq Amin Jaafar. ""But we will continue our education.""
Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition of Arab states fighting against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls north Yemen, said last month that the coalition accepted that the attack had killed dozens of people, including children on the bus, and that it was unjustified.
The kingdom and its ally the United Arab Emirates receive Western political support and buy billions of dollars a year in arms from the United States and European powers including Britain and France.
The alliance has launched thousands of air strikes in a campaign to restore the internationally recognized government, killing hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools, markets and weddings.
International pressure has mounted on the kingdom to seek a political deal with the Houthi group in a 3-1/2 year war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the already impoverished country to the brink of famine.
The alliance says it does not intentionally target civilians. The Houthis have also been criticized by rights groups.
Nearly half a million children in Yemen have dropped out of school since 2015, bringing the total number of out-of-school children to 2 million, according to a UNICEF report in March.
But teacher Abdul Wahab Salah said that fear of coalition attacks on Saada, a Houthi stronghold, would not deter the school or students.
""It pains us that we lost so many of our students. They were exceptional and they were committed,"" he said.

""We also are worried (about attacks), but we will continue to build future generations.""

The case first came before a local administration in 2015 when a Polish woman requested to register her son, who was born in London in 2014, for a Polish birth certificate, the daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita said.
The Polish woman and her female partner were registered as the child's parents in Britain, but local administrators in Poland rejected the woman's request.
An official of the Supreme Administrative Court on Thursday confirmed to Reuters that the court had now ruled in favor of the gay couple. A written statement would be issued later on Thursday. 
Polish media said the ruling was the first of its kind in Poland, where gay marriage is illegal and gay people have fewer rights than in many other European countries.
Poland ranks second last out of 28 EU countries when it comes to equality and non-discrimination, according to Rainbow Europe, an organization linked to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.
""This ruling will open up new legal possibilities for gay parents ... It civilizes and increases the safety of families who choose to live partially in Poland and partially abroad,"" said Pawel Knut, a lawyer for Polish gay rights organization, the Campaign Against Homophobia.
Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which consists of many lawmakers who oppose gay marriage, declined a request for comment. The Polish Bishops' Conference, which represents Poland's Catholic Church, said it was working on a comment.
Church attendance is declining among Poland's 38 million people, along with the clergy's influence among policymakers, but it remains one of Europe's most religious countries.

Workers called the 24-hour strike because they fear that some of country's landmarks will be included in a fund of assets to be privatized, something the government has denied. 
Archaeological sites and several museums were shut in protest including the Acropolis hill and the Parthenon, the ruins of an ancient Greek temple to the goddess Athena on top of the hill that overlooks the capital.
""We are disappointed. We are here only for one day and we will not be able to visit the Acropolis,"" Alexander Walter, a German civil servant on a cruise, said a few meters from its gates, where protesters hung a banner reading ""NOT FOR SALE.""
A few dozen workers held up banners reading: ""The archaeological culture of the country is not for sale.""
The workers are demanding the government announces which cultural sites are being considered for the fund and what sale would mean.
""We don't know which monuments and which museums are on the list,"" said the head of their union, Stamatia Marketou.
Greece's finance ministry on Wednesday said archaeological and historical sites, monuments and museum are exempt from the fund of assets to be privatized or under private management.
The culture ministry too has denied it.
""What's happening here today is out of place, to say the least,"" Culture Minister Myrsini Zorba told state TV.

Greece, which is emerging from years of economic crisis, has had record tourism this year, with more than 30 million visitors.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations human rights watchdog called on Saudi Arabia on Thursday to halt its deadly air strikes against civilian targets in Yemen and to prosecute officials responsible for child casualties due to unlawful attacks.
The censure by the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child coincided with international concern at the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh's military role in Yemen, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2.
Pressure has mounted on Saudi Arabia, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in a 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. 
Riyadh leads a Western-backed coalition of Arab states supporting the Yemeni government in fighting against the Iran-allied Houthi movement that controls Yemen's capital.
Saudi Arabia told the child rights panel last week that it was working hard to correct mistaken targeting by its military alliance, but the experts voiced scepticism.
The panel of 18 independent experts, in its conclusions issued on Thursday, took note of the Saudi statement but said that Yemeni children continue to be killed, maimed and orphaned.
At least 1,248 children had been killed and nearly the same number injured in air strikes since March 2015, including dozens killed in a strike on a school bus in Saada province in August, it said. 
All sides have carried out attacks on civilian targets in Yemen including homes, medical facilities, schools, farms, weddings and markets, in breach of international law, it said.
The panel voiced concern at ""the inefficiency of the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) set up by the coalition in 2016 to investigate allegations of unlawful attacks by (Saudi Arabia) and members of the coalition on children and facilities and spaces frequented by children"".
""There has been no case, let alone a case involving child casualties, recruitment or use of children in armed hostilities, where its investigations led to prosecutions and/or disciplinary sanctions imposed upon individuals, including military officials of (Saudi Arabia),"" it said.
The panel called for lifting the coalition's aerial and naval blockade which it said has deprived millions of Yemenis of food and other vital supplies, mainly through Hodeidah port.
In March, another U.N. rights panel called on Saudi Arabia to end discriminatory practices against women, including its pervasive system of male guardianship.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 07:52AM ET</span>",Alarm bells for Merkel as Bavarian allies face election slump,"By Paul Carrel and Jörn Poltz
BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies are heading for their worst showing in a state election in over 60 years, a setback that risks widening divisions within Germany's crisis-prone national government.
Polls show the Christian Social Union (CSU) will win at most 35 percent on Sunday, losing the absolute majority with which it has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of the post-war period.
That stable power base has also allowed the CSU, sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to punch above its weight in Berlin.
Since Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to more than 1 million migrants, CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been a thorn in her side, gradually shifting his party to the right to counter the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. 
""I would expect Seehofer to lash out against her again,"" said Carsten Nickel at consultancy Teneo Intelligence. ""The CSU is in decline, and that process ...is not going to play out without significant noise.""
Divisions between the conservative allies have widened further since March, when an inconclusive national election forced them into a coalition with the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD).
Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already come close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration and a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster, while a simmering row over phasing out polluting diesel cars now threatens to boil over.
On Thursday SPD leader Andrea Nahles, citing divisions between the CDU and CSU, again questioned her party's future in the government.
NO MERKEL IN MUNICH
On Saturday, Merkel urged the conservative parties to end their infighting before the Bavaria vote, but after her rows with Seehofer - who serves as interior minister in Berlin - she will not join the CSU's final rally in Munich on Friday.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, an immigration hardliner, will attend instead.
The CSU was forced into a coalition from 2008 to 2013 after losing its absolute majority, but had previously ruled Bavaria alone since 1966. Since 1954, its share of the vote has not fallen below 43 percent.
A weak showing on Sunday - from which the AfD and the ecologist Greens look best placed to benefit - is also likely to escalate infighting among CSU leaders desperate to revive the idea that the party represents the essence of Bavaria's economic and cultural success story.
Sunday's vote, likely to force the CSU into a coalition potentially as messy as the one in Berlin, is followed by three more events this year that pose a more direct risk to Merkel.
Her CDU is expected to suffer setbacks in another regional state vote in Hesse in late October, and the party then holds a conclave and its annual congress.
If Merkel does not emerge well, her opponents would likely ""feel encouraged to come out in the open and intensify their criticism,"" Matthias Dilling at Oxford University said. 
The parliamentary party ousted her ally, Volker Kauder, as leader last month, but senior conservatives on Sunday backed her bid for re-election as CDU chairwoman at the congress.
""HATRED AND SMEARS""
In Bavaria, support for the AfD - with whom the CSU has ruled out an alliance - stands at 10-14 percent, surveys show. 
The Greens, polling around 18 percent, are emboldened by successes in neighboring Baden-Wuerttemberg, traditionally a conservative state, where they now lead a coalition government.
After the Freie Waehler (FW), a locally focused conservative party polling around 11 percent, the Greens could be next in line as a potential partner for Seehofer - though that seems far from a natural fit.
""People in Bavaria have had enough hatred and smears ... they want politics that show courage,"" Greens' Bavaria leader Katharina Schulze said this week in a swipe at the CSU.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A British academic is being held in solitary confinement without charge in the United Arab Emirates, five months after he was arrested while in the country conducting field research for his thesis, his wife said on Thursday.
Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, was detained without explanation at Dubai International Airport on May 5 after a two-week visit, according to a statement released by his wife, Daniela Tejada.
The UAE government media office did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said British officials were supporting a British man following his detention in the UAE, without identifying the man or offering details on the case.
Hedges appeared at a court in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, after a first hearing last week, but was not informed of any charges against him, said Tejada. The court appointed a lawyer to review the case and adjourned until October 24.
An Emirati source familiar with the case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters that Hedges would be charged with espionage, but that the court was waiting for his lawyer to review the case before formally issuing charges.
State-backed media in the UAE reported in late September that the attorney general had ordered a trial for a foreign national accused of spying, without elaborating on his identity.
The English-language newspaper The National said investigators had determined that the man was trying to procure ""confidential information"" for a foreign agency, and said that he admitted to spying during questioning.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said British officials were in touch with UAE authorities.
""We are assisting his family and remain in close contact with the local authorities. The Foreign Secretary has also personally raised his case with his Emirati counterpart,"" the spokesman said.
In her statement, Tejada said her husband had been made to sleep on the floor and allowed to shower only once during his first month in detention. After three months of solitary confinement, she said, he was given a foam mattress.
""I am extremely worried about Matt's mental health and general well-being,"" she said. 
According to a profile on Durham University's website, Hedges is a doctoral student in the School of Government and International Affairs whose research interests include civil-military relations, political economy and tribalism.
Last year, he co-authored an article in an academic journal on the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member.
The UAE is a tourism and trade hub for the Middle East, but tolerates little public criticism of its monarchy or policies and is opposed to the Islamist ideology of the Brotherhood.
Emirati authorities routinely jail people for publishing content deemed offensive to the state, such as a 10-year prison sentence issued for activist Ahmed Mansoor earlier this year.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has freed from detention 11 ethnic Uighur Muslims who fled to the southeast Asian nation after a Thai jailbreak last year, and sent them to Turkey, their lawyer said on Thursday, in disregard of China's request to hand them to Beijing. 
The move is likely to strain ties with China, already tested since Mahathir Mohamad became prime minister after a stunning election victory in May and canceled more than $20 billion worth of projects awarded to Chinese companies. 
Prosecutors in Muslim-majority Malaysia dropped charges against the Uighurs on humanitarian grounds and they arrived in Turkey after flying out of Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, their lawyer, Fahmi Moin, said. 
""The charges were withdrawn because the attorney general's chambers agreed to the (appeal) from our side,"" he told Reuters.
Malaysia's immigration department, home ministry and the attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The men were detained and charged with illegally entering Malaysia after last November's daring prison break, by punching holes in a prison wall and using blankets as ladders.
In February, Reuters reported that Malaysia was under great pressure from China to deport the men there, citing sources. Some Western missions sought to dissuade it from sending them to China, which has been accused of persecuting Uighurs.
Beijing accuses separatist extremists among the Uighur minority of plotting attacks on China's Han majority in the restive far western region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
China has been accused of rights abuses in Xinjiang, torture of Uighur detainees and tight controls on their religion and culture. It denies wrongdoing.
Over the years, hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs have escaped the unrest by traveling clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey.
The Uighurs in Malaysia were part of a group of more than 200 detained in Thailand in 2014.
Although they identified themselves as Turkish citizens and asked to be sent to Turkey, more than 100 were forcibly returned to China in July 2015, sparking international condemnation.
In February, Malaysia said it was considering China's request to extradite the 11 men. In the past, it has sent some detained Uighurs to China. 
Their detention came as Malaysia drew closer to China under former prime minister Najib Razak, but 93-year-old Mahathir, in his second stint as premier, has been vocal in backing Muslim communities against persecution. 
He recently criticized Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of neighboring Myanmar, over the Nobel peace laureate's handling of the Rohingya crisis, saying, ""We don't really support her anymore.""

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Tony Blair sees 50-50 chance of another Brexit referendum,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Former British leader Tony Blair said there was a 50-50 chance of another Brexit referendum as Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely to secure a parliamentary majority for any divorce deal.
Less than six months before Britain leaves the European Union, there is little clarity about how post-Brexit trade between the EU and the world's fifth largest economy will function.
If May can strike a deal with the EU, her minority government then has to get it approved by a deeply-divided parliament. 
""Whatever Brexit is on offer today is going to result in significant economic harm,"" Blair, former head of the opposition Labour Party and prime minister from 1997 to 2007, told Reuters. ""I think the odds are now 50 percent that you will get another (referendum) vote.""
""I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped,"" he said. ""There is no majority in parliament for any proposition that the prime minister brings back."" 
Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain’s most significant political and economic move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.9 trillion UK economy and the world’s biggest trading bloc.
Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: Less than two decades ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of fringe politicians.
But the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted Britons to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.
A new vote, Blair said, could ask whether voters wanted to exit without a deal or stay in a reformed EU and offer new membership terms. He said EU leaders would be willing to reform the bloc.
BREXIT REVERSE GEAR?
Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who have suggested Britain could still change its mind.
Recent opinion polls indicate a slight move toward support for staying in the EU.
But May has repeatedly said there will be no new referendum. 
Blair said that if Brexit did happen, economic dislocation would force Britain to deregulate further to attract foreign investors.
Brexiteers anticipate some short-term economic pain but say Britain will then thrive if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.
Blair said that if the UK exited the EU and then socialist Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn won power, the country would face a ""truly damaging and challenging situation"".
""This is the problem with the policies of both major parties: they seem to think you can do Brexit and then engage in a whole lot of social legislation to make capitalism fairer and more equal and so on,"" Blair said.
""They have got to wake up to the fact that if you do Brexit your number-one priority is going to be keeping this place as an attractive place for investors to come.""
He said European regulators would not want the center of European finance - currently London - to be outside their orbit.

""Why give ourselves this problem in a field of the global economy where we are globally preeminent?"" Blair said, adding that the government had cast aside the interests of the service sector.

Lebanon held a parliamentary election on May 6, its first since 2009, but its political parties have been unable to agree yet on forming a new power-sharing government as they jostle over the distribution of ministries. 
""We waited two years for you to give the people the right to elect their representatives in parliament. And then months more to elect a president. We have been waiting five months for the birth of the cabinet,"" an-Nahar's chief executive Nayla Tueni said during a televised news conference. 
Founded in 1933, an-Nahar is one of Lebanon's largest daily newspapers. 
Political paralysis and crises have characterized much of the past decade in Lebanon, including a two-year period from 2014-2016 in which it had no president and only a caretaker government. 
The economy faces a looming crisis, with government debt among the highest in the world.
Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said this week he hoped a government would be formed after President Michel Aoun returns from an overseas trip. Aoun is due back on Friday.

But there has been no sign of a final agreement.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's coalition romped to a shock win in a May general election on the back of promises to clamp down on rampant corruption and repeal oppressive laws, some of which date back to British rule.
Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo said on Thursday that cabinet had decided to suspend use of the Sedition Act as they prepare a bill to repeal it altogether.
""As far as we are concerned, a decision has been made and it has to be communicated to the attorney-general. And, of course, it's for him to decide what to do next,"" he said in a recording of a press conference heard by Reuters.
Before the May polls, dozens of politicians and activists were detained and charged under the Sedition Act as former Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration worked to clamp down on dissent, especially after news broke in 2015 of a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
On Wednesday, Liew Vui Keong, the minister in charge of law, said the cabinet had decided to repeal the death penalty.
""All death penalty (sic) will be abolished. Full stop,"" he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times newspaper.
In a statement on Thursday, Amnesty International said the decision was a ""major step forward"".
""We are calling on the Malaysian parliament to completely abolish the death penalty for all crimes, with no exceptions,"" Amnesty secretary-general Kumi Naidoo said in the statement.
Bills to repeal both the Sedition Act and the death penalty are expected to be tabled before the parliament which sits on Monday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered officials to urgently find solutions to ease an economic crisis spurred by the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Thursday.
Washington reintroduced steps against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after the U.S. withdrawal from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. curbs on Iran’s oil exports are set to come into force in November.
Combined with rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slump in the rial and state corruption, this has caused Iran's economy to deteriorate. The International Monetary Fund predicts it will shrink 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, before recovering slowly.
""There are no problems in the country that we cannot resolve... Officials should find solutions to overcome the existing economic hardship and to disappoint the enemy by resolving it,"" Fars quoted Khamenei as telling officials on Wednesday night.
""With unity we can overcome all crises."" 
Khamenei also said Iran could resist the pressure of U.S. sanctions by relying on its own natural and human resources.
""We need extraordinary efforts ... to find solutions for those domestic economic challenges and to confront cruel American sanctions. Serious decisions should be made,"" he said, state TV reported.
The reimposition of sanctions on Iran's oil industry, the backbone of the country's economy, will likely make matters worse. 
Iran's pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani championed the 2015 nuclear deal but has been lambasted by his anti-Western hardline rivals for failing to bring economic prosperity to Iran in the years since.
""The soaring prices and the drop of purchasing power of those lower-income Iranians have put pressure on them,"" Khamenei said.
The cost of living has soared in Iran in the past months and economic grievances have led to sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foes the United States and Israel, as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile of fomenting unrest and waging an economic war to destabilize Iran.
Three people were sentenced to death last month in a drive against financial crime after Khamenei called for ""swift and just"" legal action to confront the ""economic war"" by foreign enemies.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Britain's proposed legal relationship with EU would leave ECJ in charge, lawyer says","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's proposed judicial ties with the EU would still see the European Court of Justice take the binding decision on important cases in UK law after Brexit, according to a legal opinion seen by Reuters that could stir concern among hardline Brexit campaigners.
Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged that Britain will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit, and regaining full control of Britain's laws is one of the key attractions of Brexit to its proponents.
May has proposed an ""independent arbitration panel"" in cases where there is a dispute with the European Union. But in areas where Britain has agreed to abide by a ""common rulebook"" with the bloc, Britain would recognize that the ECJ is supreme on the interpretation of EU law.
An opinion by Carl Baudenbacher, a former president of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Court, to be published by a committee of lawmakers, said that such a relationship would likely be modeled on agreements by the EU with Ukraine and Moldova.
""It is... in my view unlikely that the EU institutions and in particular the ECJ will agree to an arbitration model that is more favorable to the UK than the Ukraine model is to Ukraine,"" he wrote in an opinion to be published by a committee of UK lawmakers and seen by Reuters on Thursday.
""This means that in all important cases, the ECJ, i.e., the court of the other side, would take the binding decision.""
Baudenbacher said that any ""attempt to break elements out of the Ukraine and Moldova agreements and transplant them into a UK-EU agreement is amateurish bricolage,"" he said, using a phrase suggesting an incoherent jumble.
Instead, Britain should consider a judicial relationship with the European Union modeled on EFTA's arrangements so that it can ensure its autonomy from the ECJ after Brexit, he said.
The European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement has the EFTA Court and the ECJ as its two pillars, with the EFTA Court - which could have British judges - often making the key rulings for non-EU members.

Tel AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli court on Thursday heard the appeal of an American student against a decision to bar her entry to Israel, even though she had a study visa, over alleged activities supporting an international boycott campaign by pro-Palestinian groups.
The case has touched off a debate in Israel over whether democratic values have been compromised by a 2017 law that bars the entry of foreigners who publicly support anti-Israel boycotts, and if a hard line against the student would ultimately harm the country's image.
Lara Alqasem, 22, was accepted into a graduate program at Jerusalem's Hebrew University - which has called for her to be let in - and was issued a student's visa by the Israeli consulate in Miami.
But on arrival at Tel Aviv's international airport last week, she was refused entry by officials who cited her role as president of a small local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Florida.
Its activities, the government said, included a campaign to boycott Sabra hummus, made and sold in the United States by a company partially owned by a firm in Israel.
Alqasem, who is of Palestinian descent, has been held in a detention facility at the airport since and appealed to the Tel Aviv District Court against plans to deport her. She did not speak to reporters during the session.
The government argues that groups such as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement that want to isolate Israel over its occupation of territory which Palestinians seek for a state are anti-Semitic and aimed at its destruction.
""The time has come for some national pride here,"" Interior Minister Arye Deri said on Army Radio just before the hearing, calling the entry ban justified.
In court, a lawyer for Alqasem said she stopped her activities in the Students for Justice group months before the anti-boycott law came into effect, effectively voiding the decision to ban her.
""Visa (NYSE:V) cancellation should be done only in exceptional circumstances and this is not such a case,"" said the attorney, Yotam Ben-Hillel.
At an earlier hearing, Alqasem pledged not to take part in boycott activities while in Israel and said she did not intend to visit the West Bank, her attorneys said.
But Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said on Twitter on Wednesday that Israel would reconsider the ban only if she declares she made a mistake in the past and believes support for a boycott is ""illegitimate"".
The judge said he would issue his decision soon, without specifying a date, and ordered Alqasem returned to the airport holding facility.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Justice Kavanaugh unlikely to heed calls for recusal,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Brett Kavanaugh is unlikely to heed calls by critics to step aside from certain politically charged U.S. Supreme Court cases in which his fairness and independence might be questioned after a divisive confirmation fight, according to legal experts.
U.S. law requires justices to step aside when there is a conflict of interest or genuine question of bias, but it leaves the recusal decision in the hands of the individual justices.
Kavanaugh, Republican President Donald Trump's conservative nominee who was confirmed by the Senate on Saturday to a lifetime job as one of the nine justices, took part in his first arguments in Supreme Court cases on Tuesday and Wednesday. [nL2N1WM046]
""Supreme Court justices rarely recuse,"" University of Michigan Law School professor Richard Primus said. ""For Kavanaugh to recuse would be for him to say, 'Yes, I understand you don't trust me ... and I validate that concern.' He's not going to say that.""
Federal law requires a justice to disqualify himself from deciding cases ""in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" In a 2011 report, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said he had ""complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted.""
Recusal demands by Kavanaugh critics including Democratic lawmakers and liberal commentators focused on two main areas: certain cases involving Trump himself; and cases involving Democratic Party lawmakers or interests, considering Kavanaugh's angry remarks about Democrats during a Sept. 27 Senate hearing. Some also have suggested Kavanaugh should step aside in cases on women's issues in light of sexual misconduct allegations made against him last month. He denied the allegations.
Over the years, justices across the political spectrum have been pressed by critics to recuse themselves in cases with perceived conflicts. Litigants can file motions seeking recusal but rarely do.
During the 2016 presidential race, liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized then-candidate Trump as a ""faker,"" prompting cries by conservative critics of bias. Ginsburg later expressed regret for her remarks but has not stepped aside from any case involving Trump. And no litigant has asked her to.
Despite calls from some conservatives for her to recuse herself, liberal Justice Elena Kagan participated in a 2012 ruling upholding President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law dubbed Obamacare. Kagan had served as Obama's top Supreme Court advocate when the law was enacted in 2010 but said she played no role in its conception. 
Kagan, appointed to the court by Obama later in 2010, recused herself from other cases on which she had worked in Obama's administration. For example, she stepped aside when the court twice upheld the use of race as a factor in university student admissions, a policy known as affirmative action.
'POLITICAL HIT'
Some liberal activists and Democratic lawmakers have pointed to Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony responding to a university professor's allegation that he sexually assaulted her in 1982 as evidence of his partisanship. He repeatedly assailed Democrats, prompting questions about whether he could be fair in disputes involving Democrats or liberal groups. 
Kavanaugh complained of ""a calculated and orchestrated political hit"" by Democrats fueled by their anger over Trump's 2016 election victory, and called the conduct of some Democratic senators ""an embarrassment."" 
Democrats including Senator Mazie Hirono and Representative Jerrold Nadler have called on Kavanaugh to step aside from any case involving Democratic lawmakers.
New York University School of Law legal ethics expert Stephen Gillers said Kavanaugh's remarks were ""too broad and unfocused to give anyone the basis for a recusal motion.""
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh refused to be pinned down on whether he would recuse himself in cases involving Trump such as Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
""One key facet of the independence of the judiciary is not to make commitments on particular cases,"" including on recusal, Kavanaugh told Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.
If Kavanaugh recused himself in such cases, the court would go from a 5-4 conservative majority to an ideological deadlock with four conservative justices and four liberals.
Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law advocacy group, said she expected a ""sharp increase"" in recusal motions regarding Kavanaugh on a range of issues, possibly including women's rights. Kavanaugh could become a pivotal justice on issues including abortion.
Justices commonly step aside in cases that pose financial conflicts, for example owning stock in a company involved in the litigation. 
In 2004, the Sierra Club environmental group asked conservative Justice Antonin Scalia to step aside in a case concerning then-Vice President Dick Cheney, a friend of the justice. Scalia refused, saying he did not think his impartiality could reasonably be questioned.
Emmet Bondurant, a lawyer involved in a major political case heading toward the court involving a challenge to Republican-drawn congressional districts in North Carolina, said he will not seek Kavanaugh's recusal.
""One has to assume that no matter what was said during the confirmation process that he will approach each case, including this case, with an open mind,"" Bondurant said.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday extended for a day the search for victims of a 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami on Sulawesi island at the request of relatives of the many still missing, the national disaster mitigation agency said.
Some 10,000 rescuers toiled on what would have been the final day of searching the ruins of the seaside city of Palu, hit on Sept. 28 by the double disaster, as relatives hoped their loved ones could be found and given a proper burial.
But a spokesman for the disaster agency told a briefing in Jakarta the search would go on until Friday evening. 
The official death toll was raised to 2,073. No one knows how many people have yet to be found in Palu's ruined neighborhoods but it could be as many as 5,000, the disaster agency says.
If any reminder were needed of Indonesia's treacherous tectonics, a magnitude 6 quake struck off Java and Bali islands early on Thursday, killing three people in Java, damaging buildings and sparking panic.
The annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are being held this week on Bali and attended by more than 19,000 delegates and other guests, including ministers, central bank heads and some country leaders.
In Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi, hundreds of kilometers northeast of Bali, survivors waited for news by the debris that has entombed their relatives as workers in orange hard hats and excavators worked.
""I don't have any tears left, all I want is to find them,"" said Ahmad, 43, a farmer who was waiting near a pile of debris that used to be his home in Palu's Balaroa neighborhood.
His wife and two daughters are missing in the ruins.
Balaroa and other Palu neighborhoods were devastated by liquefaction, which happens when a quake shakes soft, damp soil, turning it into a viscous, roiling liquid.
Ahmad's third daughter was badly injured and has been taken to the city of Makassar for treatment.
""She's all I have left. Everything I own, everyone else, is gone,"" he said.
'HAVE TO DIG'
Rescue teams are working with residents to try to identify where victims could be. However, it is mostly guesswork because of how far the ground moved during liquefaction.
""We hope the families understand that there's very little hope at this point,"" said search volunteer Hadrianos Poliamar.
""At the same time, if they ask us to help, if they're pointing 'please look here, my family is under here', of course, we can't say 'no', we have to dig. We want to help as many as we can.""
Nur Alam Shah, a military search and rescue worker, said he was prepared to stay for as long as he was needed.
""But it's tough now. It's been too long - the bodies are no longer intact. At most we can find maybe a skull, or some bone fragments,"" he said.
The government has said it needs to call off the search for bodies because of concern about the spread of disease, and begin to focus on the next phase - rebuilding.
Nearly 88,000 people have been displaced and many are living in crude shelters in the hills around Palu. The government is seeking 10,000 tents.
Data on the destruction is being compiled and mapping done to help determine where new houses should be built.
The danger of tsunami near the coast in the north of the Palu and of soil liquefaction in the south are the major worries.
Areas hit by liquefaction will be turned into parks and sports fields and memorials.
Rehabilitation and reconstruction will take until 2021, the government says.
Nofal Surya, 37, lost 15 members of his extended family in Balaroa. The bodies of only seven have been found.
""If I follow my heart, of course I want the search to keep going. But I think I have to accept that I may never find them,"" he said.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's five main islands. The archipelago is often rattled by earthquakes and occasional tsunami.
In 2004, a quake off the north Indonesia island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>","Behind Bavaria's harsh rhetoric, schools offer migrants warm welcome","By Joseph Nasr
WEIDEN, Germany (Reuters) - Omar Alnifawi was 16 when he fled Syria's civil war with his family. After four years working menial jobs in Lebanon to help pay for their journey on to Europe, he had given up on ever going back to school.
Six years later, Alnifawi is enrolled at the Europa Vocational School in the southern German state of Bavaria and plans to become a mechanic.
""My friends who live outside Bavaria and who are almost as old as I am ask me: 'How come you can go back to school and we can't?',"" he said in the town of Weiden, near the Czech border.
Politicians in Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are some of the harshest critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policy. But they have also put in place one of Germany's most accommodating education programs for immigrants allocated to the state.
Their view is if migrants are in Germany to stay, they need to go to school so they can work - a pragmatic strategy they hope will help fill job vacancies, integrate the newcomers and appeal to voters bleeding left and right in Sunday's regional election.
Since the number of asylum seekers started to rise in 2011, Bavaria has raised the age for compulsory education for asylum seekers and refugees to 21, against 18 in the other 15 states. In some cases, like Alnifawi's, educators can apply for an extension to keep migrants in school until the age of 25.
Most of the students are in vocational schools, with the option of moving to university-track high schools if they excel.
Bavaria has spent hundreds of millions of euros since 2015 to hire more than 2,000 teachers to teach German to some 58,500 refugee children. That compares to 1,500 positions set up by Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for language classes for 95,000 children. 
This year Bavaria has allocated 938 million euros ($1.1 billion) for integration efforts, more than any other state.
It can afford to be generous. The state economy, home to nine blue-chip DAX-30 companies including carmaker BMW, engineering giant Siemens and sports retailer Adidas (DE:ADSGN), grew 2.8 percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent and resulting in a 3-billion-euro budget surplus, the highest in Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia had a deficit.
Bavaria is also acting on the new national philosophy that migrants today should assume a German national identity, in sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s when ""guest workers"" were welcomed on the expectation that they would eventually leave and not integrate. 
""In other states, there is more pro-integration rhetoric and less action,"" said Prof. Axel Pluennecke of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW). ""The opposite is true in Bavaria: the rhetoric might sometimes be negative but the amount of money and effort being thrown at integration is incomparable.""
The effort appears to be paying off. Migrants in the state, which has taken in some 230,000 asylum seekers, are less likely to fall into poverty and have higher employment rates than anywhere else in Germany, according to a bi-yearly report commissioned by the states to monitor integration.
Migrant pupils in Bavaria also score higher in national tests, according to the Education Monitor, a report on the state of education in Germany published by Pluennecke's institute.
Asked if NRW plans to raise the mandatory age for refugees as Bavaria has done, an official at for the state's education ministry who declined to be named said it was looking into additional measures for older refugees.
""NRW offers young refugees between the ages of 16 to 25 many education possibilities outside and inside the school system,” the official added, without giving details. He declined to be named.
BLUEPRINT?
Officials at the federal level say they are looking at Bavaria's program as a possible blueprint for the nation. 
""We are certainly looking at what is being done with migrants in Bavarian schools,"" said a senior federal official who is familiar with the government's thinking.
""Raising the mandatory vocational school age for migrants could certainly be one of our recommendations.""
It is essential that Germany get this right.
The drop-out rate among migrants is 14.2 percent, compared with a national average of just under six percent. Migrant youth without a school certificate will find it harder to get one of the estimated 1.2 million jobs that are currently vacant - the main concern of an immigration law agreed October 1.
""Most of the young migrants are eager to work. They piled up debt to come here or they have families to support back home,"" said Thomas Liebig of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ""If they get a chance to do a small job, they will and it will be difficult to bring them back into the education system. So it's important to intercept them early.""
But polls indicate the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for almost six decades, will lose its absolute majority in the parliament on Oct. 14, giving ground to the ecologist Greens, on the left, and on the right, the anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Political analysts say that's because CSU leader Horst Seehofer's attempts to sound as anti-immigration as the AfD have backfired.
""Voters who have decided to vote AfD will do so because they don't believe his anti-immigration rhetoric is genuine,"" said Julia von Seiche-Nordenheim, chairwoman of the 'Education instead of Deportation' refugee charity in Regensburg.
""At the other end of the spectrum, people don't see refugees as a threat... Those voters are going to the Greens,"" she said. A longtime CSU voter, von Seiche-Nordenheim said she plans to vote for the Green party. 
CUSTOMIZATION 
Another problem in other states is that language courses funded by the government are only open to accepted refugees and asylum seekers from five countries with protection approval rates of 50 percent or more: Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia and Iran.
This means that asylum seekers from other countries, who make up about 50 percent of all applicants, can only access those courses once their applications have been approved, which takes seven months on average.
In Bavaria, mandatory schooling applies to all asylum seekers, regardless of the status of their application. 
""Bavaria has customized its vocational school system to meet the needs of refugees,"" said Barbara Weiser, a lawyer and education expert with the Catholic charity Caritas.
About 55 percent of the 1.6 million people who have come to Germany seeking asylum over the last four years are under the age of 25. Many came from war zones and spent years with little or no schooling. 
""Most of the pupils who came to us over the last three years were unaccompanied minors,"" said Manfred Wichmann, head of the migrant education program at the Europa Vocational School. ""Not only did they come without their parents, they had nothing to prove what education they had.""
The school created six classes this year in math, science and German language, history and culture for 110 migrants. The program ends with a test, which between 80 and 85 percent of pupils have been passing, Wichmann said. Those who fail can repeat.
Successful pupils move on to a program that combines up to 3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning alongside theory lessons at school. Students choose from dozens of professions, from baking and hairdressing to banking and electronics.
In one recent lesson, the teacher quizzed students about events in Bavaria's history like the 1936 Winter Olympics and the 1939 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Munich, as well as contemporary issues such as the regional vote.
After the class, Alnifawi said he dreams of settling in Germany with a wife, children and a house in the countryside.

""But I know that without an education none of this is possible.""

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 04:36AM ET</span>",South Korea says no change on North Korean sanctions,"By Joyce Lee and Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea never considered lifting sanctions against North Korea imposed over the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship, the country's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said on Thursday.
South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the sanctions, imposed against Pyongyang following a torpedo attack on a corvette that killed 46 South Korean sailors in 2010, were under review.
North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking. 
Kang's remarks on sanctions, retracted after criticism from South Korean lawmakers, prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to say South Korea would need U.S. approval to relieve sanctions. 
""They won't do it without our approval. They do nothing without our approval,"" Trump told reporters, when asked about her comments. 
Trump has said sanctions will remain in place until North Korea it denuclearizes. 
Kang backtracked on her remarks after facing criticism from some conservative lawmakers that the sanctions cannot be removed unless North Korea first apologized for the attack, a stance adopted by former South Korean governments. 
The sanctions ban all North Korean ships entering South Korean ports and cut off most inter-Korean exchanges, including tourism, trade and aid.
""There will need to be action regarding the issue of the Cheonan warship, which was the cause (of the sanctions),"" Cho said during a parliamentary audit. 
Trump's comments triggered heated debate in South Korea, with some conservative lawmakers calling them an ""insult"".
""'Approval' is a strong and insulting word meant to say that we are progressing too fast with the North without seeking consensus with the United States,"" said Kim Jae-kyung from a conservative opposition party.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has pursued a thaw in cross-border ties, holding three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year. Last month's third summit in Pyongyang was partly aimed at salvaging faltering nuclear talks between the North and the United States. 
At their latest meeting, Moon and Kim agreed to resume economic cooperation, with construction work to be started within this year to reconnect rail and road links. They also agreed to reopen a joint factory park in the North's border city of Kaesong and the Mount Kumgang tours, when conditions are met.
In a rare sign of discord between Seoul and Washington, Kang said on Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had expressed ""discontent"" with an inter-Korean military pact reached during a summit last month.
Cho refused to comment on Trump's remarks, but said Washington was not opposed to inter-Korean dialogue and exchanges, and the allies are in close consultation. 
China, Russia and North Korea believe it is necessary to consider adjusting U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang at an appropriate time, China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - An army officer was killed and three soldiers were captured in western Iraq after militants attacked their vehicle, security sources said on Thursday.
The attack took place late on Wednesday in the town of Akaz, five kilometers (three miles) from the Qaim district of Anbar province. The unit was delivering food to other troops, the sources told Reuters.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic State militants are active in the area.
Usually militants kill soldiers and take officers captive whom they view as higher value targets, the sources said, but the reverse happened on Wednesday night.
At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack on a security checkpoint in the same area last August.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State last December, dislodging the group from all the territory it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also encompassed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017.
Security forces retook Qaim, which lies 300 km (185 miles) west of Baghdad in the Sunni province of Anbar, on the border with Syria, in November. It was one of the last remaining territories in Iraq held by Islamic State.
The group’s fighters have since then waged a campaign of killings and abductions.

Last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of next month's congressional elections. Pence also accused China of using its economic might to bully smaller countries.
China has not engaged in, and will not engage in, ""economic invasion"", Gao Feng, the commerce ministry's spokesman, said at a weekly briefing. 
The United States and China have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods over the past few months in an escalating trade conflict that could knock global trade and investment.

China is open to restarting trade talks with the United States, but regrettably the U.S. side has shown no sincerity still, Gao said.

There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The alert came shortly after Israeli army radio reported unspecified Israeli military activity near the border with the Palestinian enclave.
Rocket attacks by Palestinian militants in the Hamas Islamist-run Gaza Strip have tailed off in recent weeks as Egypt has tried to mediate a long-term ceasefire with Israel.
But tensions have remained high along the Israel-Gaza border, where Palestinians have been mounting protests that have included attempts to breach a security fence.
Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since the protests began in March, Gaza medics say, and one Israeli soldier has been killed.
Citing security reasons, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on their borders with Gaza, a policy that has deepened economic hardship in the territory of two million Palestinians.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The mental health of refugees detained by Australia on the Pacific island of Nauru has deteriorated so badly that some children are in a ""semi-comatose state"", unable to eat, drink or talk, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Thursday.
Nauru is one of two Pacific nations where Australia detains hundreds of asylum seekers intercepted while trying to reach the country by boat, a policy widely criticized by the United Nations and rights groups.
MSF, one of the few groups to independently assess refugees at the restricted facilities, provided mental health care to asylum seekers and Nauru residents until the Pacific nation canceled its contract on Oct. 5.
""During our time on the island, we witnessed a significant deterioration of mental health among our asylum seeker and refugee patients,"" Paul McPhun, executive director of the medical aid group, told reporters in Sydney.
Children are among those affected by mental heath issues, he said, although he did not give a specific number.
""Many children exist in a semi-comatose state, unable to eat, drink and talk,"" said McPhun, adding that some children required intravenous fluid drips.
Representatives for the government of Nauru and Australia's Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, who oversees the policy, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dutton told reporters on Wednesday he would like to resettle the Nauru refugees in Australia, but that would encourage other asylum seekers to attempt the dangerous journey by boat. 
Conditions in the Nauru camp, and another facility on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, have been criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.
McPhun said the decline in mental health among refugees on Nauru was ""clearly attributable"" to their indefinite detention.
""Shockingly, of the refugees we have treated, at least 78 have attempted suicide, had suicidal thoughts and attempted self-harm,"" he said.
FACES CAMPAIGN
Australia's center-right government, which faces an election in 2019, has largely won favor with voters for a policy it says prevents drownings at sea and maintains the integrity of the country's borders. Critics are trying to sway public opinion.
A social media campaign started this week by Simon Holmes à Court aimed to raise A$50,000 ($35,385) to project faces of refugee children onto the Sydney Opera House. 
The campaign raised nearly the entire amount in less than a day, organizers said.
Australia has stopped publishing data on the number of refugees held in both centers. Refugee advocates estimate 600 people are detained on Manus Island, and a further 500 on Nauru. 

MSF said it expected the humanitarian crisis to get worse as a refugee swap deal with the United States drags on. The U.S. government said in 2016 it would accept up to 1,250 refugees but fewer than 500 have been resettled.

Turkey and the United States reached a deal in May over Manbij after months of disagreement. Under the deal, the Kurdish YPG militia would withdraw from Manbij and Turkish and U.S. forces would maintain security and stability around the town.
Erdogan told reporters on Tuesday during his flight back from a visit to Hungary that the implementation of the deal had been delayed.
""There is a delay but (the deal) is not completely dead. U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mattis say they will take concrete steps,"" Erdogan was quoted as saying by Hurriyet.
The NATO allies have been carrying out coordinated but independent patrols in the region as part of the deal. 
On Tuesday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was quoted by state-run Anadolu news agency as saying that joint training of U.S. and Turkish soldiers for patrols in Manbij had begun.
Washington's support for the YPG militia in the fight against the Islamic State group has infuriated Ankara, which sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The PKK, considered a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union and Turkey, has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Ankara fears advances by the YPG in Syria will embolden Kurdish militants at home.
Relations between Turkey and the United States were further strained over the past few months by the trial of U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson in Turkey on terrorism charges, which he denies.
Asked about Brunson's trial, Erdogan said he was not in a position to interfere with the judiciary.
""Whatever the judiciary decides on, I have to abide by that decision. Those who are involved with this also need to abide by the judiciary's decision,"" Erdogan was quoted as saying by Hurriyet.

The next session in Brunson's trial will be held on Friday. The trial sparked a row between Ankara and Washington that helped send the lira down around 40 percent against the dollar this year.

The long-delayed opening of the gleaming new $5-billion Toyosu market on reclaimed land was marked by a minor truck fire and an early morning traffic jam.
As the new market's first auction kicked off at 5:30 a.m. (2030 GMT), its halls filled with the sound of bells and the shouts of traders, who also used hand signals in the scramble to get the day's best produce. 
""It might take some time to get used to,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at the site. ""Together, we would like to develop this as the core market of Tokyo, and Japan, and make the Toyosu brand better day by day."" 
The 83-year-old Tsukiji market had attracted tens of thousands of visitors each year to its warren of stalls laden with exotic species of fish and fresh sushi in a tourism boom key to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic plan.
But it had become dilapidated and unsanitary, city officials have said in planning the move to Toyosu, further away from central Tokyo, a relocation delayed many times since it was conceived 17 years ago. 
Kimio Amano, a 45-year-old blue tuna seller, said he was concerned about the location. 
""There are some customers who said they are not coming any longer because it is too far,"" said Amano. ""Let's see what happens."" 
More than 80 percent of Tsukiji fish traders oppose the move, a survey by a group fighting the relocation showed.
Demolition work is due to start on Thursday at Tsukiji, but a group of fishmongers protesting the move to Toyosu forced their way back in.
In 2016, toxic substances were found in soil and groundwater at Toyosu, once home to a gas plant, prompting Tokyo to spend an extra 3.8 billion yen ($34 million) to dig hundreds of wells to pump out groundwater. 
In July, Koike declared the site safe after experts signed off on additional clean-up measures, but some traders remain skeptical. 
The old site will provide temporary parking for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before becoming a tourist center.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Fate of Saudi journalist tests U.S.-Saudi relationship,"By Jonathan Landay, Patricia Zengerle and Yara Bayoumy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Under pressure from Congress, the Trump administration faces a dilemma: how to respond to the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi while ensuring that any punitive action does not alienate Riyadh, a key ally against Iran. 
Leading senators have already made their displeasure clear with Saudi Arabia, with Senator Bob Corker telling Reuters, ""You can’t go around killing journalists."" 
Saudi Arabia's denials that it had any role in Khashoggi's disappearance have fallen on deaf ears in Congress, with nearly a quarter of the Senate triggering a U.S. investigation into the case. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who forged close ties with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman upon taking office, has also increasingly expressed frustration with the case. 
Harsh actions against one of Trump's stalwart allies would be a sharp contrast with the administration's relatively muted tone over the kingdom's role in the war in Yemen and a crackdown on internal dissent. 
Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged the case - if Saudi responsibility is confirmed - could complicate the U.S. strategy to contain Iran, in its bid to gain influence throughout the Middle East. 
""It could affect multiple things that we’re working with them on that are very important,"" Corker said on Wednesday, adding that the Senate's relationship with Saudi Arabia was at a ""very, very low point."" 
Riyadh already is facing a backlash in Congress where anger has been mounting over civilian casualties in the Saudi-led coalition's campaign in Yemen. 
On Wednesday, a week after Khashoggi's Oct. 2 disappearance, the White House said that senior officials had spoken to the crown prince, referred to in shorthand as MbS, and Trump described the case as a ""very serious situation.""
The outcry from lawmakers of both parties, including Republican allies of Trump, foreign policy analysts, former U.S. officials and leading media commentators who knew Khashoggi, has intensified pressure on the White House to take a hard line.
Khashoggi, who had been living in the United States for the past year, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, waiting outside, said he never emerged and Turkish sources said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the building, allegations that Riyadh dismisses as baseless.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who golfed with Trump last weekend, warned on Wednesday ""there will be hell to pay"" if Saudi responsibility is proven. 
""If they’re this brazen it shows contempt, contempt for everything we stand for, contempt for the relationship. I don’t want to prejudge, but if it goes down the road that I’m worried about it going down, contempt will be met with contempt,” he said.
Later on Wednesday, nearly a quarter of the Senate's members wrote a letter to Trump that triggered a U.S. investigation into the case that could result in sanctions against individual Saudis under a U.S. human rights law.
The Saudi embassy had no immediate comment on the letter. 
BACKLASH INTENSIFYING?
Ned Price, a former Obama administration official, said he did not ""foresee a strategic reorientation"" in U.S.-Saudi ties unless Congress forces the administration’s hand.
""If it plays out the way it may play out, then we’ll see significant and meaningful tactical changes in the relationship that in large part are driven by the legislative branch,"" Price said.
Lawmakers could cut funds for Pentagon support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and press for sanctions, Price said.
The backlash could intensify if Democrats, who have led criticism of Riyadh, win one or both chambers in the Nov. 6 congressional elections.
However, they still have to be mindful of the need for Saudi cooperation on U.S. foreign policy goals, including Middle East peace, oil supplies, and missile defense system sales, analysts said.
""Riyadh is our only rational (Arab) partner because they agree with most of our long-term goals,"" said Hussein Ibish, with the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. ""So the Democrats will have to keep the door open but they can still use this to seriously harm Trump on foreign policy.""
But for now, the uproar is bipartisan.

""We have a common interest in limiting the spread of Iranian influence in the region, and it would impact that. But there are issues like human rights and norms of global diplomacy that always take precedence,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters.

WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump increased pressure on Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to provide information on what happened to missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and said he wanted to get the bottom of what he called ""a very serious situation.""
In a fresh clue, a pro-government Turkish daily on Wednesday published preliminary evidence from investigators it said identified a 15-member Saudi intelligence team involved in Khashoggi's unexplained disappearance on Oct. 2.
Pressure appeared to be building worldwide on close U.S. ally Saudi Arabia on the whereabouts of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policies, who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents for his planned marriage.
Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside, said he never re-appeared. Turkish sources said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the building and removed, allegations that Riyadh dismisses as baseless.
Asked in a telephone interview with Fox News Channel late on Wednesday whether Saudis were responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance or death, Trump said: ""I guess you would have to say so far it's looking a little bit like that and we're going to have to see.""
Earlier in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters he had raised Khashoggi's case with Saudi Arabia ""at the highest level"" and more than once in recent days.
""We're demanding everything,"" Trump said when asked if he was demanding information from the Saudis. ""We want to see what's going on. It’s a very serious situation for us and for this White House ... We want to get to the bottom of it.""
He said he and his wife, Melania, expect to invite Cengiz to the White House soon.
""People saw him go in and didn't see him come out. We're going to take a very serious look at it. It's a terrible thing,"" Trump said. ""This is a bad situation. We cannot let this happen, to reporters, to anybody. We can't let this happen.""
Increasing pressure on Trump to respond, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Wednesday triggered a U.S. investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance using a human rights law.
They asked Trump to determine whether ""a foreign person is responsible for an extrajudicial killing, torture, or other gross violation of internationally recognized human rights"" and report back in 120 days with a decision on the imposition of sanctions on whoever was responsible.
Asked about suggestions that Washington should consider blocking further arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Trump told Fox that would hurt U.S. jobs.
""Frankly I think that would be a very very tough pill to swallow for our country. ... Before I discuss this I'd have to find out what happened,"" he said.
Former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said he has suspended his role on the board of Saudi Arabia's planned mega city NEOM until more is known about Khashoggi.
After Trump spoke, the White House said national security adviser John Bolton and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the matter on Tuesday.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo followed up with his own call to the crown prince, who had forged close ties to the administration, especially Kushner.
""In both calls they asked for more details and for the Saudi government to be transparent in the investigation process. We will continue to monitor this situation and provide updates as available,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
Khashoggi's fiancée Cengiz was surprised when an American friend told her of Trump's comment about inviting her to the White House, the friend told Reuters. ""I think she's in shock, now even more,"" her friend said.
In an essay in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Cengiz implored the president and Melania Trump to ""help shed light on Jamal's disappearance.""
Trump made Saudi Arabia the first stop on his first foreign trip as president in May 2017, but in recent weeks has appeared to sour a bit on Riyadh, complaining directly to King Salman about the cost of American support for the Saudi military and for OPEC oil price increases.
SAUDI VISITORS
One of the 15 Saudis identified by name and photo in the report by Turkey's Sabah newspaper is a forensic expert who has worked at the Saudi Interior Ministry for 20 years, according to a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile and Saudi media, and serves on the board of the Saudi Society of Forensic Medicine.
Other names and photos of the 15, who Sabah said traveled on diplomatic passports, match officers in the Saudi Army and Air Force, as identified by previous Saudi media reports and in one case a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile.
The Saudi consulate referred Reuters to authorities in Riyadh who have not responded to questions about the 15 Saudis, who arrived in the city hours before Khashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2.
A Turkish security source had previously told Reuters that the 15 Saudis, including some officials, left Turkey later the same day.
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that U.S. intelligence had intercepted the communications of Saudi officials discussing a plan to capture Khashoggi, citing an unidentified person familiar with the information.
On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said the United States ""had no advance knowledge"" of such a plan.
The crown prince ordered an operation to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from the United States and then detain him, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.
The Post said it was not clear to officials with knowledge of the intelligence whether the Saudis discussed harming Khashoggi as part of the plan to detain him in Saudi Arabia.
Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Riyadh over the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent, and since then wrote columns for the Washington Post. 
Britain's foreign minister called for urgent answers and the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker, who has seen classified intelligence on the case, said information pointed to Khashoggi being killed. 
""To me ... it feels very much some nefarious activity has occurred by them. But I don't want to rush to judgment,"" Corker said on Tuesday.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday the United States was ready to help in any way in the investigation.
Wednesday's Turkish media reports were the most detailed accounts yet of what they say is the Turkish government's investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance. 
Sabah newspaper published the names and years of birth of the 15 Saudis it said arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk airport. Twelve of them arrived early on Tuesday, based on photos captured at passport control which it published. The 15 departed at four different times, Sabah reported. 

It did not say how it obtained the pictures and data.

Leiva's case marks the first time Costa Rica has granted such protections to a Nicaraguan citizen since political turmoil and civil unrest grew increasingly deadly in the neighboring Central American country.
More than 300 people have been killed and at least 2,000 injured in crackdowns by police and armed groups on protests that began in April over government plans to cut welfare benefits. That soon escalated into broader opposition to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
""This is a special protection for people including diplomats or those who have participated in political movements in their countries of origin,"" the Costa Rican foreign ministry said in a statement.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The World Bank Group unveiled a new system on Thursday to rank countries based on their success in developing human capital, an effort to prod governments to invest more effectively in education and healthcare.
The bank's ""Human Capital Index,"" showed poor African countries fared the worst in the rankings, with Chad and South Sudan taking the two lowest spots, while Singapore topped the list, followed by South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.
The rankings, based on health, education and survivability measures, assess the future productivity and earnings potential for citizens of 157 of the World Bank's member nations, and ultimately those countries' potential economic growth.
The index was unveiled at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings on the Indonesian island of Bali.
It found that on average 56 percent of children born today will forego more than half their potential lifetime earnings because governments were not investing adequately to ensure their people are healthy, educated and ready for an evolving workplace.
World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said he hoped the new index would encourage governments to take steps aimed at moving up the rankings, much as they seek to with the bank's popular ""Doing Business"" survey, which ranks countries based on ease of doing business, with low-tax, low regulation economies faring better.
Kim acknowledged that the rankings would be controversial, but told reporters that the need for more and better investment in people was ""such that we couldn't shy away from making leaders uncomfortable"".
""This is about drawing their attention to a crisis that we think is real. This is connected to productivity, this is connected to economic growth,"" Kim said.
He said there was ""unanimous"" acceptance among World Bank member countries and the bank's board.
The index measures the mortality rate for children under five, early childhood stunting rates due to malnutrition and other factors, and health outcomes based on the proportion of 15-year-olds who survive until age 60. It measures a country's educational achievement based on the years of schooling a child can expect to obtain by age 18, combined with a country's relative performance on international student achievement tests.
Countries in Africa with high childhood stunting rates and low access to formal education fared worst, while wealthier nations with strong educational systems fared best.
In Chad, the lowest country ranked on the list, the World Bank said productivity and earnings potential would be only about 29 percent of what their potential would be under ideal conditions there. 
In top-ranked Singapore, the earnings potential was 88 percent of potential, while in the United States, ranked 24th between Israel and Macau, productivity and earnings were measured at 76 percent of potential.
Kim said there were 28 countries, from Indonesia to Lesotho to Ukraine, who signed on as ""early adopters"" of the index to work with the World Bank to devise plans to improve their investment in health and education.
The bank has warned that a wave of automation and artificial intelligence will eliminate many low-skilled jobs in coming years, making it harder for people with low levels of education and poor health to compete for work.
The index showed that a country ranked at 50 percent, such as Morocco and El Salvador, would lose 1.4 percentage points of annual GDP growth compared to its potential under ideal health and education conditions.

ABOARD JS KAGA (Reuters) - Japan's Kaga helicopter carrier is not the biggest, fastest or most powerful warship to sail the seas, but its 500 crew wage a daily war on dirt and grime to keep it the cleanest.
At sunset each evening on a nine-day goodwill voyage from Indonesia to Sri Lanka, Reuters journalists watched the crew arm themselves with mops, brushes and dusters to clean the 248 meter long (813 ft) ship. 
""I believe that Kaga is the cleanest ship anywhere,"" said Hayato Nishida, a 36-year-old chief petty officer responsible for keeping the vessel spick and span. 
""We do it at a set time and everyone splits up the tasks,"" he said in a store room that doubles as an office for Nishida and two colleagues who oversee a 30-minute cleaning frenzy every day.
Sailors scrub toilets, mop and buff floors, and remove dust from the web of overhead pipes, wires and vents along the ceilings of one of the newest ships in Japan's Maritime Self Defence Force (MSDF). 
Brass door fittings are smeared in petroleum jelly to fend off corrosion. Carpeted meeting rooms are vacuumed and then cleaned with lint rollers to pick up stray dust. Ceilings are the biggest challenge, because they are the hardest to reach.
""Keeping the ship clean means we can use it for a long time,"" Rear Admiral Tatsuya Fukuda, the task force commander, said in his spotless cabin. ""It also teaches sailors to love their ship and to perform to the best of their ability.""
The group effort is an extension of habits the crew learned at school, Nishida said. Japanese pupils are expected to keep their classrooms tidy and share the work of cleaning after lessons end, to encourage teamwork.
""We don't have any dedicated cleaning crews. Everyone joins in,"" said Nishida, who walks the ship to inspect their work.
  
BUFFED TO A SHINE
The Kaga, Japan's second big helicopter carrier, entered service in 2017, giving its military greater ability to deploy beyond its shores.
The goodwill tour to Sri Lanka, an island nation strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes, is part of Japan's effort to push back against China's growing influence in Asia.  
The 20,000-tonne ship still smells of fresh paint and its floors are buffed to a shine. Dust is hard to find. 
Life on board revolves around meal times, starting with breakfast at 6:30 a.m. Sailors line up to wash their hands before entering the mess, the only place, apart from living quarters, where they are allowed to eat or drink.
After their shift end, sailors can soak in deep stainless steel seawater baths that follow Japan's traditional bathing culture, or take a cleanwater shower. 
Crewmembers can stay in shape jogging on the Kaga's sprawling flight deck or work out in a gym. Others follow traditional methods of purifying minds and bodies, such as shodo calligraphy, Iaido sword drawing or taiko drumming. 
""If the ship isn't clean, people could get sick, and it is not comfortable living in a place that is dirty,"" Kanayuki Morishita, a 21-year-old trainee, said as he scrubbed a urinal with a toilet brush.
The exterior gets a cleaning too, including the anchor and its chain after they are pulled up from the sea floor.
The flight deck, where the Kaga's sub-hunting Seahawk helicopters take off and land, can get a coating of salt from the spray of seawater.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had arrested and indicted a spy for China's Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets from several U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.
Chinese operative Yanjun Xu was detained in Belgium in April after a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and extradited to the United States on Tuesday. The Washington Post reported he was lured to Belgium by U.S. agents.
The FBI called it an unprecedented extradition and said the indictment showed the direct oversight of China's government in economic espionage against the United States.
The charges come as Washington increases pressure on Beijing over its trade policies and alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.
Cybersecurity experts said the arrest was another sign of the escalating trade tensions between the two countries, adding they had seen increasing espionage by Beijing for business advantage.
""China is actively engaging in targeted and persistent intrusion attempts against multiple sectors of the economy, including biotech, defense, mining, pharmaceutical, professional services, transportation and more,"" said CrowdStrike Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch.
A U.S. Department of Justice statement said Xu, a deputy division director for the State Security Department of China's Jiangsu province, targeted several U.S. aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, a subsidiary of  General Electric  Co (N:GE).
It described another unnamed firm as ""one of the world's largest aerospace firms, and a leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems,"" and a third as a leader in unmanned aerial vehicle technology.
GE Aviation has supplied engines for large  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) aircraft, and is working on a new generation of engines for commercial planes and heavy-lift military helicopters.
The indictment against Xu said he targeted aviation firms since around December 2013. It also said he made contact with experts working for the firms and recruited them to travel to China, often for the initial purpose of delivering a university presentation and paying their costs and a stipend.
""This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States,"" the statement quoted Bill Priestap, the FBI's assistant director for counterintelligence, as saying.
John Demers, the assistant U.S. attorney general for national security, said the case was not an isolated incident.
""It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense,"" he said. ""We cannot tolerate a nation stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.""
The Chinese Embassy and Xu's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The maximum penalty for conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage is 15 years, while that for conspiracy and attempt to steal trade secrets is 10 years.
The Ministry of State Security is China's intelligence and security agency and is responsible for counterintelligence, foreign intelligence and political security.
Cybersecurity experts said former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping had reached an understanding in 2015 on cyber espionage, but the agreement appeared be withering away.
Chris Painter, the former U.S. State Department official who negotiated the agreement, said in a Twitter post it was ""not surprising that now the relationship has deteriorated, so has the agreement.""
Late last month, the Department of Justice reported the arrest of a Chinese citizen in Chicago on charges he covertly worked for a high-ranking Chinese intelligence official to help try to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked as U.S. defense contractors.

NBC News on Tuesday quoted U.S. officials as saying a professor at a top cancer research center in Houston facing child pornography charges was also under scrutiny for alleged economic espionage for China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The operator of a limousine company that owned the vehicle involved in a crash that killed 20 people in upstate New York was charged on Wednesday with criminally negligent homicide, New York State Police said.
Nauman Hussain, 28, was charged with one felony count related to the deadliest U.S. transportation accident in nearly a decade. All 20 victims were listed on the charging document. 
Hussain was issued written violations by police and the state Department of Transportation that the driver he hired should not have been operating the 2001 Ford Excursion limousine involved in Saturday's crash. 
The state ordered that vehicle out of service in September and it should not have been on the road, New York State Police Superintendent George Beach said. 
""The sole responsibility for the motor vehicle being on the road on Saturday rests with Nauman Hussain,"" Beach said.
Hussain is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday evening in Schoharie, New York. 
Shahed Hussain, Nauman's father and the owner of Prestige Limousine, was not in the country and more charges were possible, Beach said. 
The company's lawyer, Lee Kindlon, told a news conference on Wednesday that he intended to defend Nauman Hussain against any charges. 
Kindlon said on Tuesday that safety violations issued last month on the limousine involved in the accident were largely minor and had not caused the crash. 
The vehicle, carrying 17 people on their way to a birthday party on Saturday, ran a stop sign at a highway intersection in Schoharie, about 40 miles (65 km) west of Albany, police and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said.
It crashed into an unoccupied parked car and two pedestrians before coming to a halt in a shallow ravine, officials said. The driver, all 17 passengers and the two pedestrians were killed.
George Longworth, an attorney for the family of the driver, 53-year-old Scott Lisinicchia, said on Tuesday that his family ""believes that unbeknownst to him, he was provided with a vehicle that was neither roadworthy nor safe for any of its occupants.""
Before the crash, one of the victims, Erin McGowan, texted a friend that the limousine appeared to have engine trouble, the New York Times reported.

State authorities and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.

The quake hit about 200 km (125 miles) southwest of the town of Rabaul at a depth of almost 40 km, just before 7 a.m. local time (2100 GMT Wednesday). 
""We felt the earthquake a bit, but it was not too strong,"" Constable Roy Michael told Reuters by phone from Rabaul police station.
He said there was no damage in the town, but officers had not yet been able to contact villages closer to the epicenter. 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves less than 0.3 meter high could be expected on coastlines in Papua New Guinea and neighboring Solomon Islands. Australia's Tsunami Warning Center said its coastlines were not at risk.
The quake was initially recorded with a magnitude of 7.3 but was downgraded. At least two aftershocks with a magnitude greater than 5 shortly followed.
In March, a 6.6 magnitude quake struck nearby and no casualties or damage were reported.
Papua New Guinea, one of the world's poorest countries, sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is still recovering from a 7.5 quake that hit some 900 km to the west in February, killing at least 100 people.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>","Hurricane Michael, among strongest in U.S. history, slams Florida Panhandle","By Rod Nickel
PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in a quarter century and the third-most powerful ever to strike the U.S. mainland, roared into the state's Gulf coast on Wednesday with tree-snapping winds and towering waves.
Michael, whose rapid intensification as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico caught many by surprise, made landfall early in the afternoon near Mexico Beach, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Panama City in Florida's Panhandle region, with top sustained winds reaching 155 miles per hour (249 kph).
The storm came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Its sustained winds were just 2 mph (3.2 kph) shy of an extremely rare Category 5. 
As predicted, the storm was downgraded hours later to a still-formidable Category 3 with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph) and higher gusts as it pushed inland to the Alabama-Georgia border.
Causing major disruptions to oil and gas production in the Gulf even before its arrival, the storm was forecast to unleash waves as high as 14 feet (4.3 meters) above normal sea levels in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. 
“My God, it’s scary. I didn’t expect all this,” said Bill Manning, 63, a grocery clerk who fled his camper van in Panama City for safer quarters in a hotel, only to see the electricity there go out. ""Panama City, I don’t know if there will be much left.""
Only a couple of hours after Michael came ashore, floodwaters were more than 7-1/2 feet (2.3 meters) deep near Apalachicola on Florida's Panhandle, National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham said.
Authorities had urged coastal residents in 20 Florida counties along a 200-mile (320-km) stretch of shoreline to head to higher ground before the storm, but anyone who had not fled by Wednesday morning was told it was too late to evacuate.
An estimated 6,000 evacuees took cover in emergency shelters, most of them in Florida, and that number was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by week's end, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. 
Even before Michael made full landfall, it was whipping trees with its winds and flooding the town of Port St. Joe.
""It feels like you don't know when the next tree is going to fall on top of you because its blowing so ferociously,"" said Port St. Joe Mayor Bo Patterson. ""It's very, very scary. We have trees being uprooted, heavy, heavy rain.""
'JAW-DROPPING' STRENGTH
Patterson said about 2,500 of the town's 3,500 people had stayed put, including about 100 in a beachside area who ignored a mandatory evacuation order. ""This happened so quickly, we weren't exactly prepared,"" he said.
Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said early evacuation efforts in the area were slow.
Michael grew from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane over the course of about 40 hours. 
""Satellite images of Michael’s evolution on Tuesday night were, in a word, jaw-dropping,"" wrote Bob Henson, a meteorologist with weather site Weather Underground.
With minimum barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, a measure of hurricane strength, Michael stood as the strongest storm ever to hit Florida's Panhandle and the most intense anywhere in the state since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
Michael also ranked as the third-most powerful storm on record to make landfall in the continental United States, after Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys.
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. He was briefed by FEMA's Long in the Oval Office on preparations. 
At mid-afternoon, about 192,000 homes and business customers were already without power in Florida alone, with more outages reported in Georgia and Alabama, utility companies said. 
Michael was forecast to move across southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia on Wednesday night.
Helen Neal, 88, and her husband, J.W. Neal, 87, preferred to take their chances in a hotel rather than stay in their two-story Panama City Beach beachfront house about a mile away.
""We just finished renovating and updating,"" she said. ""We’re kind of nervous. God willing, we’ll still have some place.""
About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm recovery, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel, Governor Rick Scott said.
NHC's Graham warned that the storm would continue to pack tropical storm-force winds when it reached the Carolinas, still reeling from severe flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence last month. Up to a foot (30 cm) of rainfall was forecast for some areas from Michael.

Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared an emergency for 92 counties in his state, and a state of emergency also was announced in North Carolina.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 05:47PM ET</span>",Former Fernandez confidant sentenced in Argentine corruption case,"By Scott Squires and Cassandra Garrison
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A member of former President Cristina Fernandez's cabinet was sentenced to nearly six years in prison on Wednesday, one of the highest-profile convictions in a corruption crackdown that has also ensnared Fernandez. 
Julio De Vido, who served for 12 years as planning minister under Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner, was sentenced to five years and eight months on charges that he siphoned money from public works projects, indirectly causing a 2012 wreck of a passenger train that left 51 people dead and 700 injured.
""I am here because of perverse political, media and judicial persecution that I have been subject to since December 2015,"" De Vido said during his trial, referring to the date President Mauricio Macri took office.
De Vido is one of the highest-ranking former officials from the Kirchner and Fernandez era to be stripped of immunity and prosecuted. Fernandez has been indicted on graft charges, but she is immune from arrest as a sitting senator in the country's national legislature.
She has denied receiving bribes and challenged investigators to scour her home region of Patagonia if they believed she had hidden cash.
Speculation is rife that Fernandez could try to run against Macri in next year's presidential elections, although she has not said she has any plans to seek the presidency again. 
""If she is the leading opposition presidential candidate, it is much tougher to put her in jail,"" said Mark P. Jones, director of the Argentina Program for Rice University's Baker Institute.
Despite the corruption scandal, Fernandez and her Peronist movement still enjoy popularity among about a third of Argentine voters, Jones said. Fernandez won two presidential elections through nationalist appeals and generous social welfare programs.
De Vido is also under investigation for his alleged involvement in a broad corruption network in which Fernandez and dozens of former officials allegedly accepted hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes from construction companies to secure public works contracts. 

The 'notebooks' scandal, as it is known, surfaced in August after local media obtained diaries kept by the chauffeur of a former government official, which investigators have said cataloged bribe payments from construction companies that were delivered to government offices and Fernandez's private residences.

Diaz-Canel, who took office from Raul Castro on April 19, tweeted a photo of a ceremony celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first Cuban war of independence from former colonial power Spain from his account @DiazCanelB.
It quickly got several hundred replies, some welcoming Diaz-Canel to the twittersphere, others attacking Cuba's leaders and its one-party system. Castro, 87, did not have an official twitter account. He and his late brother Fidel Castro had run the country for nearly 60 years.
Cuba observers are on the lookout for signs of whether Diaz-Canel, the first non-Castro president in decades, will usher in economic and political reforms in the Communist-run country.
In the first half year of his presidency, Diaz-Canel has demonstrated more a change in style of communication, showing himself to be more open and modern, than a shift in rhetoric or policies..
His first tweet included the hashtag #somoscontinuidad, ""we are continuity"".
Whether because of a lack of cash, a long-running U.S. trade embargo or concerns about the flow of information, Cuba has lagged behind in web access. Until 2013, internet was largely only available to the public at tourist hotels in Cuba.
Now Cubans mainly access the web at Wi-Fi hotspots in parks and plazas throughout the country although the country's telecoms monopoly ETECSA has said it is working on rolling out home access and mobile internet for all the population.
In the first high-level U.S delegation to Cuba after he took office, Diaz-Canel met former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. He also met with executives of U.S. tech companies during his first trip to the United States in late September.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>","Apple Watch, hired jet, mystery vehicle figure in search for missing Saudi dissident","By Orhan Coskun, Sarah Dadouch and Stephen Kalin
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Jamal Khashoggi believed he was safe in Turkey.
Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist and newspaper editor, had lived in exile in Washington for more than a year, writing a column for the Washington Post in which he regularly criticized his country's crackdown on dissent, its war in Yemen and sanctions imposed on Qatar.
He said he could write freely in the United States in a way that was impossible at home, according to friends and colleagues, but he was increasingly worried that Riyadh could hurt him or his family.
In Turkey, though, Khashoggi had friends in high places, including some of President Tayyip Erdogan's advisers. So when he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 2, he hoped the appointment would be brief, a simple bureaucratic task that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee, whom he had met four months earlier.
""He said the safest country in the world for Saudi Arabians was Turkey,"" said Yasin Aktay, an Erdogan aide and close friend of Khashoggi.
Friends and family have not seen him since.
    Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi, 59, was killed inside the consulate. 
Saudi Arabia has strongly rejected the accusation. The kingdom's ambassador to the United States, Prince Khalid bin Salman, said reports suggesting Khashoggi went missing in the Istanbul consulate or that Saudi Arabia had killed him ""are absolutely false and baseless"" and a product of ""malicious leaks and grim rumors.""
    ""Jamal is a Saudi citizen who went missing after leaving the Consulate,"" the ambassador said in a statement. Saudi Arabia has sent a team of investigators to work with Turkish authorities and ""chase every lead to uncover the truth behind his disappearance.""
    In interviews, Turkish officials provided new details of their investigation into the missing journalist.
Two senior Turkish officials revealed the existence of an object that may provide important clues to Khashoggi's fate: the black Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch he was wearing when he entered the consulate. The watch was connected to a mobile phone he left outside, they said. 
Investigators are also focusing on 15 Saudi men who entered the consulate around the same time as Khashoggi and left a short time later. These men had arrived hours earlier from Riyadh, most of them by private plane, the officials said. By the end of the day, they were on their way back to the kingdom.
Turkish newspaper Sabah said on Wednesday it had identified the 15 as members of a Saudi intelligence team. They included a forensic expert. A Turkish official did not dispute the report.
And investigators are trying to trace a vehicle that left the Saudi consulate at the same time as two cars destined for the airport, one of the officials said. This vehicle didn't turn toward the airport, but set off in the opposite direction.
This story is based on interviews with Turkish officials, Khashoggi's fiancee and more than a dozen of his friends, who gave insight into the columnist's state of mind in the days leading up to his disappearance, and explained why he went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, not the embassy in his adopted home of Washington.
The case threatens to drive wedges between Saudi Arabia and Turkey and between Riyadh and its western allies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 9 he plans to speak with Saudi Arabian officials about Khashoggi's disappearance. The mystery also threatens to undermine Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's drive to attract foreign investors and new high-tech business to a country that is too dependent on oil revenues.
     
    A NEW LIFE
Khashoggi met his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who is 23 years his junior, in May at a conference in Istanbul, according to Cengiz and a close friend of the Saudi journalist. 
    Their relationship quickly evolved, and Khashoggi spoke about wanting to start a new life with her. By August, the couple had decided to marry in Turkey, where Cengiz lived, and spend much of their time there.
""Jamal bought an apartment in Istanbul and we were furnishing our new home,"" Cengiz told Reuters on Oct. 9. ""We were planning to marry this week before Jamal flew back to Washington.""
The decision to marry in Istanbul, whose mosques reminded Khashoggi of his hometown Medina, set off a paper chase that ultimately ended in Khashoggi's disappearance. 
Turkish law required that Khashoggi, who was divorced, provide proof that he did not have a wife. He asked if he could get the document from the Saudi embassy in Washington, according to a friend in Europe, but was told the consulate in Turkey was better placed to help. 
Cengiz said Khashoggi wouldn’t have applied for the document in Istanbul if he could have avoided it. Asked to comment, a Saudi official said it was ""not accurate"" that Khashoggi was told to go to Istanbul.
    The friend recounted how he warned Khashoggi against getting the paper in Istanbul for fear the Saudis might arrest him if he set foot in the consulate. ""He told me there is no solution except to arrange for this paper with the consulate in Turkey,"" said the friend, who was in frequent contact with Khashoggi in the days before he disappeared. Khashoggi reassured him, he said, that his good connections in Turkey meant ""no one can do anything to harm me in Istanbul.""
    Khashoggi visited the consulate without an appointment on Friday, Sept 28. Cengiz waited outside. That first meeting went smoothly. Khashoggi told Cengiz and several friends that officials in the consulate had treated him politely. They explained the paperwork would take time to prepare.
Khashoggi exchanged phone numbers with a consulate official named Sultan so he could call and check on progress, according to three friends. Sultan said the document would be ready early the following week. Reuters has not been able to locate Sultan or confirm his role at the consulate. The consul declined to comment on who Khashoggi spoke to.
""He came out smiling. He told me 'inshallah (God willing) I will receive this paper after I come back from London,'"" Cengiz said.
Confident he would soon have the paperwork he needed, Khashoggi flew to London later the same day to attend a conference. He was asked there by colleagues about the threat he faced from the Saudi authorities for his work, according to some of those present.
""One of my colleagues at dinner asked if he saw a possibility that his citizenship would be withdrawn,"" said Daud Abdullah, director of Middle East Monitor which organized the conference. ""He discounted that - he didn't think the authorities would go that far.""
An exiled Saudi dissident who spoke to Khashoggi in the days before his disappearance, said his friend was worried that he might face interrogation by the Saudis, but nothing more.
Another friend, British-Palestinian activist Azzam Tamimi, who saw Khashoggi during that trip to London, said he ""didn't seem scared at all. The opposite. He was relaxed and calm."" Tamimi saw Khashoggi off at the airport in London.
MYSTERY MEN
Khashoggi flew back to Istanbul from London on Monday evening, Oct 1. The following morning, he spoke again with consul worker Sultan, who told him to collect the document at 1 p.m the same day.
Outside the consulate, a low rise building at the edge of one of Istanbul's business districts, Khashoggi handed Cengiz his two mobile phones, the fiancee told Reuters. He left instructions that she should call Aktay, the Erdogan aide, if he didn't reappear. Khashoggi was wearing his black Apple Watch, connected to one of the phones, when he entered the building.
A senior Turkish government official and a senior security official said the two inter-connected devices are at the heart of the investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance.
""We have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,"" the security official said. Investigators are trying to determine what information the watch transmitted. ""Intelligence services, the prosecutor's office and a technology team are working on this. Turkey does not have the watch so we are trying to do it through connected devices,"" he said.
Tech experts say an Apple Watch can provide data such as location and heart rate. But what investigators can find out depends on the model of watch, whether it was connected to the internet, and whether it is near enough an iPhone to synchronize.
When Khashoggi did not emerge quickly, Cengiz said she at first hoped he had got the document and was talking with consul staff. ""But when time passed and employees started leaving the building and he still wasn't out, I panicked,"" she said.
She called Aktay, the Erdogan aide, around 4.30 p.m and told him her fiance was missing. As soon as he received the call, Aktay told Reuters, he contacted Turkish security forces and intelligence officials. ""Of course I also called the office of the president, who was in a senior party committee meeting at that point,"" Aktay said. ""After about half an hour, everybody was informed and ready to take the measures needed in this case. And of course then, a long period of tension and expectation started.""
Local and international media reported Khashoggi's disappearance the next day, Wednesday, Oct. 3. Turkish authorities said there was no evidence to suggest Khashoggi had left the building, and they believed he was still inside. Saudi authorities countered that their citizen had left the consulate and that they were investigating.
Two Turkish security sources told Reuters that security camera recordings showed Khashoggi had not left the consulate by either of its two exits.
They said that 15 Saudi men had entered the building at around the time Khashoggi went in, having flown into Istanbul earlier in the day, most of them on a private aircraft from Riyadh and some on commercial flights. 
The men left after ""some time"" in two cars and returned to the airport, the sources said. They said a third vehicle left at the same time but turned in the opposite direction. Investigators are trying to trace its route by analyzing surveillance cameras. The Istanbul consulate referred questions about the 15 men and the vehicles to Saudi authorities, who did not respond to a request for comment.
""It is a very mysterious situation. Diplomats that came in private jets, stay in Turkey for a few hours, and leave. It is also very easy for them to pass through security due to their diplomatic immunity,"" one of the security sources said.
According to Flight Tracker, an online flight tracking system, a private plane that brought nine of the men in the early hours of Oct. 2 was registered to a company called Sky Prime Aviation Services. A company official confirmed that Sky Prime Aviation owned the plane and that it was in use on Oct. 2, but gave no further details. He said the firm was owned by a private company registered in Saudi Arabia. Two industry sources said the firm belongs to the Saudi government. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.
The other six men arrived on commercial flights, the security source said. The 15 men checked in, briefly, to two hotels, the Movenpick and Wyndham, which are close to the Saudi consulate. The hotels declined to comment.
As pressure built on Saudi Arabia to locate their missing citizen, Saudi officials in Istanbul showed a Reuters reporter around the consulate on Saturday, Oct. 6, opening cupboards and inviting him to inspect the ladies' bathroom. A few hours later, Turkish authorities said they believed Khashoggi had been killed.
A Saudi source told Reuters that British intelligence believed there had been an attempt to drug Khashoggi inside the consulate that culminated in an overdose. He said the information came from a British intelligence source. Contacted by Reuters, British intelligence did not comment. Asked about this account, a Saudi official said: ""This death is not true.""
REFORM NOT REVOLUTION
Khashoggi's message in his columns for the Washington Post was one of reform, not revolution.
He often championed political change but did not question the Saudi monarchy as an institution. He criticized the royal family for misusing Saudi's oil wealth and questioned specific policies, such as the war in Yemen and the arrests of Saudi intellectuals and activists.
His bumpy relations with the Saudi authorities and the clerical establishment predated the rise of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. In 2003 he was fired as editor-in-chief of reform newspaper Al Watan, less than two months into his tenure, after publishing columns critical of the growing influence of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia.
In 2007, he was named editor-in-chief of Al Watan for a second time but was forced to resign three years later after publishing an article that challenged some elements of Salafism, a branch of Sunni Islam.
Khashoggi was also the consummate insider, as an adviser to former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal and a confidant of billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.
Yet by early 2017, he was feeling the heat again. The authorities ordered him to stop writing and tweeting, then he watched as other writers, including several friends, were detained in a crackdown on dissent in September, 2017.     ""He was outside (the country), so he didn't return,"" said his friend, Tamimi.
In the United States, he felt he could speak freely. Karen Attiah, his editor at the Washington Post, said it was as if he had rediscovered journalism. ""When he was in the newsroom, when I brought him the first time, he became energized. He took a selfie and said, 'I miss this. I miss being in a newsroom.' We spoke about editing and what it was like to talk to writers. He just lit up,"" she said.
An acquaintance said Khashoggi was considering launching new projects from Washington. One idea focused on bringing attention to political prisoners in Saudi Arabia and promoting democracy in the Arab world, said the acquaintance.
Attiah, the global opinions editor of the Washington Post, said Khashoggi rarely expressed fears for himself but he was ""really torn up"" about the pressures on his family. ""I did worry about Jamal,"" she said. ""I just thought, 'Who would be so brazen to go after him?'""

The website said records show Fedotov visited Britain in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and left the country on March 4 this year, the same day as two other GRU agents who have already been named.
Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a public bench in Salisbury on that date, and the case prompted the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War.
Britain said they were poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union, and has accused two men it says are officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence service of carrying out the attack.
Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning, as have the two men identified by Britain.
Last month, the Telegraph newspaper said British police had identified a third Russian intelligence officer they believe carried out a reconnaissance mission before the attempted murder of Skripal. The paper did not name him.

A trade union leader and business lobby group representative said they understood it would take 40 years for the new system to be fully phased in.
The government wants to align the retirement systems in the public and private sectors as well as the variety of different pension set-ups for different professions.
The new single system would use points so that each euro paid in would give the same retirement benefits no matter what sector pensioners worked in.
Currently, retirement benefits are based on a worker's salary during the last six months before retirement in the public sector and the average during the last 25 years in the private sector.
""The implementation of a new, universal system is a response to the fragility of our current system,"" Jean-Paul Delevoye, Macron's middleman, told a meeting with labor unions and business representatives.
Officials have said France's legal retirement age will remain 62.
A decade ago, more than a million people took to the streets in protest against pension reform. France's more hardline unions have warned of a repeat if the upcoming changes are not to their liking.
""We think this proposal will lower pensioners' standard of living to near the poverty threshold,"" said Catherine Perret, a negotiator for the militant CGT union.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was approved in July by all 193 U.N. member nations except the United States, which backed out last year.
Hungary's right-wing government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an immigration hard-liner, has said it will not sign the final document at a ceremony in December. Poland, which has also clashed with Brussels by resisting national quotas for asylum seekers, is considering taking the same step.
""We view some of the points in this agreement very critically. We will therefore do everything to maintain the sovereignty of our country and ensure that we as the Republic of Austria can decide for ourselves on migration issues,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told a news conference.
Kurz led his conservatives to victory in last year's parliamentary election by pledging to prevent any repeat of the European migration crisis that began in 2015, when Austria took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers.
Kurz went into government with the anti-Islam Freedom Party and together they have agreed to restrict immigrants' access to welfare payments as part of an agenda that is also heavy on law and order.
Speaking after a weekly cabinet meeting, Kurz and his vice chancellor, the Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache declined to say specifically which points they were concerned about other than that they affect countries taking in migrants.
""We are in close contact with states like Switzerland and we in the government will determine a concrete course of action in the coming weeks,"" Kurz said, adding that Denmark was another country with similar concerns.
The Swiss government, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that its own analysis had found that the U.N. pact ""corresponds with Switzerland's interests in migration"". 
It described the accord, which aims to set standards for safe and orderly migration, as politically rather than legally binding. Austria said it was examining the extent to which the agreement is binding.

""It cannot ... be that any formulations are adopted that could perhaps or possibly be interpreted to mean that migration can be a human right. That can and must not be the case,"" Strache told the news conference.

""The Russian Federation is using the Black Sea to project force in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Defence Minister Mihai Fifor told an international conference hosted by the Aspen Institute think tank.
""The situation has changed dramatically in the last year,"" he said. 
Romania is one of the European NATO states along with Poland that has ramped up defense spending, as the alliance seeks to deter Russia and undergo modernization.
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu told the conference that strengthening cybersecurity and addressing hybrid warfare threats from Russia would also be an additional focal point during Romania's presidency of the EU.
Speaking to Reuters later, Fifor said the Bucharest government planned to unveil two more major military procurement programs before year's end, augmenting already announced plans to buy new fighter jets and other equipment. 
He said Romania had met the NATO defense spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the past two years, and would continue spending at that level for a decade.
""We plan to add two more major programs after we present them to the Supreme Defence Council,"" Fifor said.
He gave no details on what type of acquisitions would be involved in the two procurement programs.
Earlier this year, Romania signed up to buy Patriot missile defense systems as part of an integrated air defense system. It also hosts a U.S. ballistic missile defense station and has contributed troops to U.S.-led and NATO campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada made mistakes in its dealings with Saudi Arabia which helped spark a diplomatic dispute, the former Canadian ambassador to Riyadh said in frank remarks on Wednesday.
In August, Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Canada, expelled envoy Dennis Horak and ordered all Saudi students home after the embassy issued an Arabic language tweet urging the immediate release of women's rights activists.
""It was a situation that didn't need to occur ... to sort of yell from the sidelines I don't think is effective,"" Horak said in a phone interview. Horak's comments mark the first time a senior Canadian official has conceded Ottawa was partly responsible for the row.
Horak also said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - which continually stresses the importance of human rights - should have spent more time trying to improve ties with the Saudis.
The tweet in question was a translation of a message initially sent out from the foreign ministry in Ottawa. 
Horak, now retired, said he did not know the tweet was going to be issued and would have advised against it.
""The urging of immediate release I think went too far,"" he said, and described the Saudi government's response as a ""serious over-reaction"".
Gulf sources told Reuters that Riyadh considered the tweet to be a break with diplomatic norms.
Analysts say the Saudi response shows the limits of reforms by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs its day-to-day government. He has launched a campaign of social and economic change, but has not eased the absolute monarchy's total ban on political activism.
Horak, noting the two nations have not had a particularly strong relationship in recent years, said whether or not ties improved would depend to a large extent on Riyadh.
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, speaking on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting, asked Canada on Sept. 26 to apologize for its actions and to stop treating the kingdom as ""a banana republic"".
Horak, who was head of Canada's diplomatic mission in Iran when the previous Conservative government cut ties with Tehran in 2012, said Ottawa needed to put more effort into talking with nations it did not always agree with.
""We're wrong not to engage a country like Saudi Arabia,"" he said.
""We yell via tweet or statement ... but in terms of trying to effect change, or trying to have any influence on those issues we're interested in, it's not effective because they have no investment in the relationship. So why would they listen to us?"" he added. 
In a statement, the office of Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland referred to Horak as ""a retired public servant"" and said Canada would always stand up for human rights.
Saudi authorities were not immediately available for comment.

ROME (Reuters) - When Giuseppe Conte was named prime minister in June, very few Italians had ever heard of him, yet his approval ratings have climbed steadily and he is now the country's most popular active politician, opinion polls show.
An Ipsos poll published on Saturday gave Conte an approval index of 67, above those of any of his recent predecessors as premier, and also above his more high-profile deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio.
Salvini, who leads the right-wing Northern League, got a rating of 57, while Di Maio, head of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, was on 52. Their government meanwhile was also riding high in the ratings.
Other recent surveys by pollsters Demos&Pi and GPF have shown similar results, suggesting Italians appreciate the more measured tones of the 54-year-old lawyer who is close to 5-Star but is not a member of either party.
Conte got off to a difficult start, with accusations he had inflated his academic credentials and a faltering maiden speech in parliament blighting his first weeks in office. He said he had made no false claims and the furor was soon forgotten. 
He has since grown into the job and seems increasingly comfortable and sure-footed with the media, always formally dressed in suit and tie and speaking in clipped, nasal tones.
""Conte was a Mr Nobody when he arrived but he has carved out a fundamental role as a political bridge-builder,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of the Rome-based political risk consultancy Policy Sonar.
""He has managed to strike a balance between institutional dos and don'ts on the one hand, and the anti-establishment 'animal spirits' of the ruling coalition on the other."" 
The Ipsos poll showed Conte was also more popular than the government as a whole, which still enjoyed a high approval rating of 64.
The combined voter support for the ruling League and 5-Star stood at 62.3 percent, while the center-left Democratic Party, the country's main opposition, languished on 17.1 percent. 
""More than 100 days after the government was formed, its honeymoon period is consolidating,"" said Ipsos Italia chief Nando Pagnoncelli.

""That consolidation is based not only on the (government's) measures, but on voter sentiment, on a changed mood in the country.""

Participants waving rainbow flags marched in bright autumn sunshine in the rally - whose motto is ""In the name of freedom"" - from the main government building in the capital Pristina to a central square where they danced, embraced and kissed.
Kosovo deployed special police units to protect the marchers but no incidents were reported. The former Serbian province, which declared independence in 2008, is 90 percent Muslim and, like much of the Balkan region, socially conservative.
""We call on state institutions not to deny our identity,"" Lendi Mustafa, one of the organisers and who is transgender, told the crowd. ""Today we demand freedom for people who have no possibility of escaping the pressure of family and society.""
A Serbian gay activist, Aleskandar Savic expressed solidarity with the Kosovo marchers. 
""We all fight for the same goals, we share the same values so it is logical that despite our different ethnic background we support each other,"" Savic, from Belgrade Pride, told Reuters.
On Tuesday, Fjala (Word), a political party that fights for the rights of Muslims, said the Gay Pride event was ""a parade of shame"", and tried unsuccessfully to have it cancelled.
Some rights activists say Kosovo should allow same-sex marriage. At present the constitution says ""everyone enjoys the right to marry"" but family law also states that those who marry should not be of the same sex.
Commenting on Wednesday's Gay Pride parade, Kosovo's Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said: ""Our constitution guarantees individual freedom for all.""
""LGBT and Pride Week will always have institutional support, to be free and secure to express their orientation,"" Haradinaj said in his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.

The European Union, which Kosovo hopes to join one day, has said fear remains widespread in the country's gay community.

""An agreement is within reach for Oct. 17, next Wednesday, if we succeed to the end of this negotiation now,"" Barnier said in a speech to business leaders at the European Parliament.
EU leaders are due to meet for dinner in Brussels next Wednesday and hope to agree a withdrawal treaty with Britain that Barnier said was 80-85 percent ready but on which obstacles remain, notably on how to keep the new EU-UK land border with Northern Ireland from reviving conflict in the British province.
The European Union is doing all it can to ensure checks on goods moving across Northern Ireland's borders would be made ""in the least intrusive way possible"", for example on ferries, at ports or in factories of origin, he said. But veterinary and food security controls will have to take place at the border. 
Barnier said Brexit would trigger the need for customs, VAT and compliance checks with EU standards between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event that a planned ""backstop"" were triggered because a future EU-UK trade deal was not sufficient in itself to ensure the land frontier was not a ""hard border"". 
For customs and VAT, Barnier said, ""we propose using the existing customs procedures to avoid doing checks at the transit points"". He said customs declarations could be done online in advance.
""The only visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on lorries or containers, which should be done on ferries or in transit ports.""
For industrial goods, he said it could be done by ""market surveillance authorities"", on-site in the companies. But he said checks of animals and animal-derived products would still have to take place on the border and cover all of that trade.
""Our challenge is to make sure that these procedures are as easy as possible and not burdensome, particularly for small and medium business,"" he said in a speech that ended with a standing ovation.

The British government and leading politicians in Northern Ireland insist they will not agree to a withdrawal treaty that foresees the possibility of Northern Ireland being kept inside the EU's economic area while the British mainland is not.

Khashoggi, 59, disappeared a week ago and was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he went to pick up a document he needed for his planned marriage. Saudi officials have said that he left the consulate but his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside, said he never appeared.
Turkish sources have said they believe Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policies, was deliberately killed and removed from the building. Saudi Arabia has strongly rejected the allegations.
Trump said the United States was working closely with Turkey to find out exactly what had happened and was seeking information from Saudi Arabia.
""We're demanding everything. We want to see what's going on,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's a very serious situation for us and for this White House.""
""I want to see what happens and we're working very closely with Turkey and I think we'll get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said.
Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Riyadh over the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent, and since then wrote columns for the Washington Post.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has urged Riyadh to prove its claim that Khashoggi left the consulate after his meeting there.

A pro-government Turkish daily on Wednesday published preliminary evidence from investigators it said identified a 15-menmber Saudi intelligence team involved in Khashoggi's disappearance.

The other three alleged participants have also been charged in Belgium. 
Two of them were arrested by Belgian police in June with 500 grams (one lb) of TATP, an explosive that can be home-made from easily available chemicals, as well as a detonation device.

Varadkar's Fine Gael party formed a minority government in 2016 under the deal with the largest opposition party, Fianna Fail, which agreed to abstain from opposition-driven votes over the course of three annual budgets.
The parties agreed to initiate talks after the last of those budgets was presented on Tuesday. But while Varadkar said he wanted to complete the review by early November, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin sees talks lasting until Christmas.
""We have no intention of accepting artificial deadlines or any proposal which would deny the thorough review which we envisaged when reaching agreement in 2016,"" Martin told the Irish parliament on Wednesday.
""In case anyone tries to use the Brexit situation as an excuse for claiming there is instability, we have assured Ireland's European (Union) partners of the stability of Ireland's negotiating position and that nothing will be done to in any way interfere with a deal being done and implemented.""
Martin was referring to newspaper reports on Wednesday speculating that Varadkar could push for a December election if Britain settles differences with the European Union over future management of the Irish border to enable the United Kingdom to strike a divorce deal with the EU.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday a divorce agreement with Britain was ""within reach"", calling for decisive progress in the talks in time for a summit of all 28 EU leaders next week. The main outstanding dispute is over how to keep the Ireland-British border open after Brexit.
Varadkar has formally proposed extending the deal with Fianna Fail until the summer of 2020 when an election would be held. Some senior Fianna Fail members favor a shorter extension, if one is to be agreed.

Fine Gael currently lead Fianna Fail in opinion polls by a wider margin than at the last election in 2016 when it won just six more seats in Ireland's 158-seat chamber.

The ministry said it would work with international experts from consultancy Preverisk to carry out comprehensive checks.
The British couple, John and Susan Cooper, died within hours of each other on Aug. 21 while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada.
Last month, Egypt's public prosecutor said that e-coli bacteria was a factor in the deaths. 
The prosecutor said John Cooper, 69, was suffering from health problems but that e-coli caused gastroenteritis and heart failure which killed him. Cooper’s wife Susan, 63, was also likely to have been affected by e-coli and died of Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a blood ailment, the prosecutor said.
The ministry did not mention the deaths of the British tourists but said in a statement the checks would ""improve health and safety standards through detection, follow-up, training and performance development for all employees at these hotels, especially those who work directly with food and beverages."" 
Egypt is trying to revive tourism, a crucial source of foreign currency, while the economy is still struggling from the years of turmoil that followed a 2011 popular uprising. 
The ministry of tourism said the investigation of hotels in Hurghada would be followed by checks of hotels and tourist resorts in other parts of the country.

Fujimori was detained when she arrived at the state prosecutor's office to testify in the case, under Peru's Organized Crime Law, according to an official document seen by Reuters.
Her lawyer, Giuliana Loza, told local radio station RPP that the decision to arrest Fujimori had been ""abusive and arbitrary.""
""There is not a jot of evidence against her,"" she said. 
Fujimori leads the powerful conservative opposition party, Popular Force, which has a majority in Congress and was key to helping topple former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a graft scandal in March.
Last week, a pardon granted to her father by Kuczynski was annulled.
Following his extradition to Peru in 2007, Alberto Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for commanding death squads that massacred civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his rightwing government. He was later found guilty of corruption.
Keiko Fujimori's legal troubles could help President Martin Vizcarra, who threatened to dissolve Congress last month to pressure the opposition to pass his proposed judicial and political reforms.

A twice-defeated presidential candidate, Keiko Fujimori has led Popular Force since her father was imprisoned in 2007.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's government has approved a plan to more than double state pensions over the next four years for the country's 5.2 million retirees, a move that critics say will put heavy strain on public finances in the long run.
Under the plan, pension-related spending in the social security budget would rise steeply to 142 billion lei ($35.12 billion) by 2022, from about 62 billion set aside for this year.
""We won't enforce any cuts in exchange, nor introduce new taxes to support this plan, GDP will expand every year over the next four years,"" Labour Minister Olguta Vasilescu told reporters on Wednesday. The budgetary impact will be 8.4 billion lei in 2019.
The aim of the overhaul is to iron out discrepancies that have built up over the years between various beneficiaries of the state pension system, regardless of the year of retirement or previous employment.
The ministry said previously that the cash required to meet the plan would be partly covered by a 70 percent increase in revenues from mandatory social contributions.
The government, which has a comfortable majority in parliament, will now submit the plan to legislators for debate and approval.
Vasilescu said that after 2022 all state pensions would be adjusted in line with consumer price inflation plus 50 percent of the real growth of the average wage in the economy.
Official statistics put the current monthly average state pension in Romania at about 1,100 lei. 
The Social Democrat government is targeting a consolidated budget deficit of just under 3 percent of GDP - the European Union's ceiling - this year. Economists polled by Reuters expect an overshoot to 3.1 percent of GDP.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Federal police in Brazil are investigating possible money laundering in a case related to the airport seizure of wrist watches valued at some $15 million from the vice-president of Equatorial Guinea in September.
In a statement, the police said they had carried out seven search warrants in two states, including in the capital Brasilia, and in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city.
While the police did not explicitly name the target on Wednesday, they said the searches were part of the same investigation as an operation in September when they seized $1.4 million and 20 diamond-studded watches valued at $15 million belonging to Teodoro Nguema Obiang at an airport near Sao Paulo. 
As part of the police operation announced on Wednesday, authorities said they were also investigating the purchase of a luxury duplex apartment in an upscale Sao Paulo neighborhood.
""The apartment was acquired ... for 15 million reais ($4.02 million). Investigations indicate that the apartment was acquired by a company with 10 million reais in capital, belonging to the subject of the investigation,"" police said.
Reuters was not immediately able to locate Teodorin, as Obiang is widely known. In September, the government of Equatorial Guinea denounced the seizure and said that the cash and watches were meant to cover the cost of the trip.
The government also said in a statement that Brazilian authorities had misrepresented ""the true sum of the money and the value of the confiscated jewels,"" and called for the confiscated assets to be returned.
Obiang, who is the son of Equatoguinean President Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mbasogo, has attracted the attention of prosecutors in the United States and France in recent years.
Last October, million of euros of assets belonging to Teodorin were ordered seized by a French court that found him guilty in absentia of using money plundered from his country to buy property and luxury cars.
The Paris court found Obiang, 48, guilty of embezzlement, and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his French assets. He denied the charges. 
In that trial, the court scrutinized his residence in Paris, which he bought for 25 million euros ($28.8 million) in 2005. It has 101 rooms, a gym, a hair-dressing studio and a disco.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",South Korea says Pompeo complained about inter-Korean military pact,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has expressed ""discontent"" with an inter-Korean military pact reached during last month's summit, South Korea's foreign minister said on Wednesday, in a rare disclosure of signs of disagreement with its U.S. ally. 
The two Koreas agreed to halt military drills, set up a no-fly zone near the border and gradually remove landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarised Zone, among other steps.
The deal was sealed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their third summit in Pyongyang on Sept. 18-20. 
During an annual parliamentary audit on Wednesday, an opposition party lawmaker asked Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha if Pompeo had complained about the agreement during a phone call reported earlier by Japan's Nikkei newspaper.
""Yes, that's correct,"" Kang said in response. ""I wouldn't say he made strong expressions. (It was) discontent, about how he was not briefed sufficiently, and he had a lot of questions within my knowledge.""
Her remarks amounted to a rare confirmation of discord between Seoul and Washington, amid U.S. concerns that inter-Korean relations may be warming too fast relative to negotiations to dismantle North Korea's nuclear arms program.
While maintaining that it remains in lockstep with the United States, South Korea has forged ahead with efforts to engage with North Korea, even as critics accused Moon of naively focusing on feel-good theatrics at the expense of real progress in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Kim vowed to work toward denuclearization during his unprecedented June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. But Pyongyang's actions have since fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and materials. 
When asked by a South Korean ruling party lawmaker whether Washington felt the South was pushing ahead too rapidly with its reconciliation policy toward the North, Kang cited views regarding ""adjusting the pace"" of inter-Korean moves.
""I don't think the military agreement would bring significant changes in terms of readiness or operations, but they (U.S.) could complain we made far more concessions than the North did, especially ahead of the second North Korea-U.S. summit,"" a South Korean military source told Reuters, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""The U.S. could prefer a reciprocal approach where each side makes a concession step by step, rather than a comprehensive bargain as we did.""
Kang and Pompeo spoke by phone on Sept. 17, a day before the three-day inter-Korean summit kicked off and shortly after Seoul informed Washington of the military accord, a diplomatic source told Reuters. 

The Pyongyang summit was in part designed to help revive nuclear talks between the North and the United States, which were on shaky ground after Trump canceled Pompeo's visit to the North in late August, citing a lack of progress.

HOEK VAN HOLLAND, Netherlands (Reuters) - British troops disembarked in the Netherlands on Wednesday en route to Norway to test NATO's ability to move personnel and armor quickly across Europe, an exercise officers said showed London's commitment to European security after Brexit.
In a drill with Cold War echoes, Britain is moving some 600 armored vehicles, jeeps and supply trucks and 1,200 troops by land to NATO's northern flank over 10 days to join the alliance's biggest exercises since the end of the Soviet Union.
""We haven't done this ... since the Cold War,"" Dutch Brigadier General Hans Damen said as 76 dark green British army vehicles arrived at dawn at the ferry port of Hoek van Holland.
Britain, which has the biggest defense budget in the EU and is rivaled for military capability only by France, is eager to show that despite its vote to leave the European Union it remains committed to Europe's security.
""In a post-Brexit world we will still do this, we are still a member of NATO, we will still help our European partners,"" said British Major Stuart Lavery.
Part of NATO's response to Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, 45,000 troops from 29 NATO countries plus non-members Sweden and Finland will mass in the Arctic for the ""Trident Juncture"" exercise from Oct. 25.
SENDING A MESSAGE
Several years in the planning, the exercise follows Russia's biggest drills since the 1980s. 
Britain branded Russia a ""pariah state"" last week when, along with the Netherlands and United States, it accused Russian military intelligence of cyber attacks on the West. Russia denies wrongdoing and blames NATO for threatening stability with a military build-up on Russia's borders. 
Admiral James Foggo, commander of U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa, said on Tuesday the alliance's preparedness was ""a message to anyone who might conduct any kind of an aggressive act"".
The Arctic exercise emphasizes NATO's traditional role defending Europe, after years when it took responsibility for the U.S.-led war in far-off Afghanistan. 
Allies will train in sub-zero temperatures to see how they fare when fuel threatens to freeze, equipment jams and survival means keeping on special snow boots even inside sleeping bags. 
First, the British troops will tackle more mundane obstacles en route, such as border clearances and vehicle breakdowns.

""It's all about recording what issues arise and ensuring that we are ready for them in the future,"" said British Lieutenant Harry Busby.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Social Democrat chief questions future in troubled German coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Social Democrat leader Andrea Nahles questioned her party's future in the government after a rocky six months during which the coalition has twice come close to collapse.
In an interview with Die Zeit newspaper, Nahles blamed divisions within the two conservative parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition, which relies on the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to govern.
""If the internal spat among the conservatives continues to overshadow everything, there obviously comes a point at which good substantive work no longer makes any sense,"" Nahles said in the interview, extracts of which Die Zeit released before publication on Thursday. 
The coalition - made up of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian CSU allies and the SPD - had a row last month over the fate of the security service chief. That followed a dispute between the CDU and CSU in the summer over immigration. They ultimately found compromises on both issues.
""Ever since this government has taken up work or actually ever since the coalition negotiations started, the dispute among conservatives over what direction to take has been a huge burden for this coalition,"" Nahles said. 
The SPD was reluctant to form another grand coalition with the conservatives after a national election in September 2017 but initial talks between the conservatives and two smaller parties failed, leaving no other viable government.
The government took office only in March, nearly six months after the election, and the coalition deal includes a clause that envisages a review of its progress after two years. This is widely seen as giving the SPD an exit should it want one. 
Nahles also criticized Merkel, saying the chancellor had not yet been able to steer the coalition into calmer waters.

Differences over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with excessive emissions have also strained the government, though the parties agreed last week to ask carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes.

Coast Guard Lieutenant Kyriakos Papadopoulos died late on Tuesday of a heart attack. Greek media gave his age as 44.
Papadopoulos steered his patrol vessel out to sea during the crisis, pulling to safety refugees, including women and children, who were attempting the short but dangerous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece.
Born and raised on the island of Lesbos, Papadopoulos ""showed Europe what the values of humanity, solidarity, equality and peace mean to Greece"", Greek Maritime Minister Fotis Kouvelis said.
""He showed and highlighted the value of human life.""
The mayor of Lesbos, Spyros Galinos, wrote on Twitter: ""As of today, Lesbos is poorer.""
Barely four miles (six km) from Turkey, Lesbos has a history of taking in Greek refugees who fled Turkey in the 1920s.
In 2015, Lesbos was the preferred entry point into the European Union for nearly one million people, mostly Syrians fleeing civil war. On some days, as many as 3,000 people arrived on its shores, crammed in dinghies unable to hold their weight.
Several hundred people drowned and many went missing.
The coast guard, aided by fishermen, managed to help thousands ashore. In Greek media, Papadopoulos was feted as ""the hero of the Aegean"" or ""the guardian angel of refugees."" 
""In a way, I panic, too. I'm scared. I can't reassure them,"" Papadopoulos said in a short Oscar-nominated documentary film ""4.1 Miles"" in 2016. 
""When I look into their eyes, I see their memories of war. They come from war. They escape the bombs that fall on their homes,"" he said.
""And we see these families in the Greek sea. Losing each other in the Greek sea. In the sea of a peaceful country because of the way they have to cross.""
Papadopoulos is survived by his wife and two daughters.

Two security sources said Abdullah Mursi was arrested on charges of ""spreading false news"", in connection with an interview he gave to the Associated Press news agency last week that focused on his father's detention. 
In the interview, Abdullah said his father's health had deteriorated due to prison conditions and that the family was rarely allowed to visit. 
Abdullah's brother Ahmed told Reuters the police officers did not present an arrest warrant and said they were taking Abdullah for questioning.
An interior ministry spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
The former president, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, has been jailed since he was overthrown by the military in 2013, following mass protests against his rule. 
Abdullah is the youngest of his five children. Another son, Osama, is also in prison and was among hundreds recently sentenced in connection with protests against Mohamed Mursi's overthrow.
After Mursi's ouster, then-army chief and now President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi unleashed a fierce crackdown on the Brotherhood. 
Sisi's supporters say the president, who was reelected in March, has been trying to combat an Islamist insurgency and restore order following years of chaos after ""Arab Spring"" demonstrations forced former president Hosni Mubarak to step down in 2011.

YANGON (Reuters) - Three senior journalists at Myanmar's largest private newspaper were remanded in custody after handing themselves in to police on Wednesday, facing accusations of causing ""fear or alarm"" following a complaint from the Yangon regional government.
One of the men, Eleven Media Group's editor-in-chief Kyaw Zaw Linn, had earlier told Reuters that police raided the paper's offices at about 7 p.m. on Tuesday, but he and two other journalists sought by the authorities were not there.
""The office informed me that they came because of an article in the journal,"" he said, shortly before entering a police station in central Yangon's Tamwe township with lawyers on Wednesday morning.
Hours later the three journalists were taken in handcuffs to Tamwe township court, where they were remanded in custody to Insein Prison, northern Yangon, until Oct. 17.
Defense lawyer Kyi Myint told reporters outside the courthouse that the Yangon regional government had filed a complaint over an article by the paper's chief reporter Phyo Wai Win. The article, published on Monday, included quotes from regional lawmakers raising questions about public spending, including on an overhaul of transport in the country's commercial hub.
Yangon's regional government is headed by Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein, a protégé of Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and a member of her National League for Democracy party. 
The chief minister's assistant, Maung Maung Kyi, declined to comment on the complaint filed by the regional government, referring all questions to an information department that Reuters was unable to reach on Wednesday. National government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer a call seeking comment.
Police told staff at Eleven Media on Tuesday evening that a case had been opened against Kyaw Zaw Linn, Phyo Wai Win and editor-in-charge Nayi Min under Section 505 (b) of the country's colonial-era penal code, said Ko Oo, an editor at the paper.
Section 505 (b) prohibits publishing information that may ""cause fear or alarm"", that could cause someone to commit an offense, or disrupt ""public tranquillity"". It carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.
Lawyer Kyi Myint said the trio's defense would be that the article was accurate.
""I didn't write anything wrong,"" said Phyo Wai Win as he entered the police station. ""I only wrote the truth.""
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Myanmar said in a statement it was ""deeply shocked and disturbed"" by the arrest of the three journalists, while Amnesty International's director of crisis response, Tirana Hassan, called for their immediate release.
Free speech advocates say press freedom in Myanmar has retreated under the administration of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, who took power in 2016 under a constitution that preserves the military's role in politics despite a formal end to decades of army rule.
A total of 38 journalists have faced charges under various laws during her administration, freedom of expression group Athan said last month.
Two Reuters reporters were convicted last month of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison, drawing global condemnation. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were detained last December while investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims that took place during a military crackdown in western Rakhine state.
Last month, a former newspaper columnist who was harshly critical of Suu Kyi on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was sentenced to seven years in prison for sedition.

The chief executive and another editor of Eleven Media were detained for nearly two months in late 2016 on charges relating to a complaint made by Yangon Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein over a Facebook post alleging corruption in his ties with local businessmen. Phyo Min Thein told a news conference at the time that the allegations were ""intended to defame my personal dignity"". Eleven Media published an apology.

The move was made despite a high court having ordered a hold on judicial appointments, which were made under recommendations of serving judges, rather than politicians, before the arch-conservative PiS party won election in 2015.
The perceived politicization of the judiciary has drawn fire from the EU, Poland's own liberal and centrist opposition and civic rights groups who say the country is backsliding toward authoritarianism almost 30 years after the demise of communism.
Through legislation and personnel changes, critics say, the Law and Justice (PiS) party has taken de facto control of much of the judiciary including the constitutional court and prosecutors, as well as turning the main news programs of the state media into propaganda tools.
The government says the changes are needed to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the eastern European country of residues of communist rule.
""This way (new judge appointments) another stage of the judiciary reform has been carried out, a very important one...that is, restoring the foundations of confidence in the judiciary,"" Pawel Mucha, deputy head of President Andrzej Duda's chancellery, told a news conference.
Poland's judicial oversight body, the KRS, which recommends judicial appointments to the president, was until 2015 staffed mainly by judges chosen by other judges; now they are chosen mainly by PiS officials.
Last month the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the procedure of appointing new Supreme Court judges be put on hold, but Mucha said this decision was not binding on the president.
Earlier this year PiS passed legislation forcing into early retirement more than a third of judges at the Supreme Court, which validates election results in Poland. 

Critics say the changes undermine freedom and democracy and they have triggered an EU lawsuit over what the bloc says is a violation of the independence of courts in a member country.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - The president of the Maldives, Abdulla Yameen, filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, challenging his defeat in last's month election in the island nation, which has been in political upheaval since the declaration of emergency this year.
Yameen conceded defeat after an official count showed joint opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had polled 16.8 percent more votes in a surprise result. But opposition members have worried about a smooth transition of power, due on Nov. 17.
Yameen's supporters had complained about rigging of votes and fraudulent ballot papers, his lawyer Mohamed Saleem told reporters after approaching the top court.
""There are a lot of complaints from supporters,"" he said. ""We decided to submit the case after going through those complaints. President Yameen did not want to let this go as the concern is about the rights of his supporters.""
Critics are wary of Yameen, who ran the islands with an iron hand, jailing political opponents and Supreme Court justices.
In February he declared a state of emergency to annul a court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including former president Mohamed Nasheed.
Complaints about the election result came from voters as well as monitors, Yameen's Progressive Party of Maldives said in a statement. 
The Election Commission said the vote had been free and fair, with turnout of 89.2 percent.
The Maldives, located near key shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, has become important as China and India compete for influence in the region.

China is engaged in building up the islands' infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia.

The sentence highlights a long-standing belief between Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan that the other country does not adequately prevent cross-border militant attacks.
Shah Mohammad and Nazirullah were arrested in 2016 after traveling to Pakistan to hand over information to Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.

Nadim said the accused had shared secret information about attacks and bomb blasts.
Afghanistan’s Western-backed government has long accused Pakistan of harboring Afghan Taliban insurgents, a charge that Islamabad denies.
Islamabad, in turn, accuses Afghanistan of not doing enough to eradicate Pakistani Taliban militants, many of whom are based in Afghanistan and mostly carry out attacks inside Pakistan.

The number of casualties was roughly in line with the same period a year earlier, when there were 8,084 casualties, with deaths this year rising five percent to 2,798 and injuries falling three percent to 5,252, the report from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said.
""As there can be no military solution to the fighting in Afghanistan, the United Nations renews its call for an immediate and peaceful settlement to the conflict,"" said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top UN official in Afghanistan.
Seventeen years after U.S. forces led a campaign to overthrow the Taliban following the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the figures underline how dire the security situation remains.
While the figures show little change in the overall trend of violence, the UN highlighted the indiscriminate use of suicide and IED attacks, which killed 1,065 civilians and wounded 2,569 in the first nine months, a total of 3,634 casualties, compared with 3,007 casualties in the same period of 2017.
""UNAMA recalls that attacks deliberately targeting civilians and the murder of civilians are serious violations of international humanitarian law that amount to war crimes,"" it said in the report.
With parliamentary elections due on Oct. 20, security officials warn that attacks are likely to pick up on polling stations and other election sites, many of which are located in schools, mosques or health clinics. 
A wave of suicide attacks in the eastern province of Nangarhar and in the capital Kabul this year has hit students preparing for exams, spectators at sporting events, people waiting to register for elections as well as Shi'ite mosques.
The mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority has been especially heavily targeted by attacks claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State.
The report attributed 65 percent of casualties to the Taliban, Islamic State and other anti-government forces.

As casualties from suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices rose, casualties from ground fighting fell by 18 percent to 2,311 (605 deaths and 1,706 injured). At the same time, there was a 39 percent rise in the number of casualties from air strikes, which have risen as air operations have been ramped up, to 649 (313 deaths and 336 injured).

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday compared having an abortion to ""hiring a ""hit man"" to eliminate a problematic person, in comments sure to be welcomed by conservative Catholics who have accused the pontiff of not speaking out enough on ""cultural war"" issues.
Abortion is a raging political battle in a number of countries, including the United States, where many conservatives hope the Supreme Court will eventually overturn the landmark 1973 ruling known as Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.
Francis made his off-the-cuff comments on abortion, some of his toughest to date, in an address to tens of thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his weekly general audience.
The pope denounced what he called the contradiction of allowing ""the suppression of human life in the mother's womb in the name of safeguarding other rights"".
""But how can an act that suppresses an innocent and helpless life that is germinating be therapeutic, civilized or even simply human?"" he said.
""I ask you: 'Is it right to 'take out' a human life to solve a problem? What do you think? Is it right? Is it right or not?"" he said in unprepared remarks.
Many in the crowd shouted ""No"".
""Is it right to hire a hit man to solve a problem? You cannot, it is not right to kill a human being, regardless of how small it is, to solve a problem. It is like hiring a hit man to solve a problem,"" he said.
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that life begins at the moment of conception and ends at the moment of natural death. It also forbids euthanasia but says that a family or a patient can decide to stop using extraordinary means to keep people alive.
Shortly after becoming pope in March 2013, Francis appeared to downplay the importance of ""cultural war"" issues such as abortion, contraception and gay marriage, saying in an interview the Church had become ""obsessed"" with them.

""It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,"" he said in that interview, adding that the Church's stand on them was very clear and that it also had to address social issues such as poverty, injustice and immigration.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Survivors of Indonesia's double disaster looked to their future with frustration and despair on Wednesday as the government outlined plans to begin reconstruction of homes for tens of thousands of people.
The official death toll from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on Sept. 28 has risen to 2,045, with more bodies being found as some 10,000 rescuers scour ruins in the seaside city of Palu.
More than 82,000 people were displaced in the worst-hit city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta, and 67,000 homes destroyed or damaged.
Many survivors are living in shelters made out of salvaged wood and plastic in the city and surrounding hills, where they wait and wonder what will happen to them.
""They keep saying there's going to be compensation, but where is it?"" asked student Ahmad Hidayat.
Hidayat is from the city's Balaroa district, which was devastated by liquefaction, which happens when an earthquake violently shakes soft, damp soil, turning solid ground into a viscous, roiling liquid.
""What are the plans? Are we going to be relocated, will there be help to move people back? There's no certainty,” said Hidayat, standing in a heavily damaged garage where he works part-time with other young men, trying to salvage auto parts from the debris.
Another Balaroa resident, Hesti Andayani, 27, was sitting and crying on tiles that she said used to be part of her bedroom. It was her first trip home since the earthquake struck, killing her younger sister.
""I don't know what we'll do. We don't have any money. I'll have to find a job but I don't know where we can live,"" she said.
Rescue teams were working with residents to try to identify where victims could be. But it's guesswork because of how far the ground moved during liquefaction.
No one knows how many people have yet to be found in Balaroa and other neighborhoods but it could be as many as 5,000, the disaster agency says.
BODY BAGS
Twenty-six bodies were found on Tuesday but the number seemed to fall off on Wednesday. Reuters reporters saw only two victims being carried out in plastic body bags.
The government has called off the search for bodies from Thursday, citing concern about the spread of disease.
That has angered many relatives of the missing but it will focus the efforts of authorities on the next phase - rebuilding.
""Reconstruction and rehabilitation are scheduled to start in early November,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
He said data was being compiled and mapping done to help determine where houses should be built.
The danger of tsunamis near the coast in the north of the city and of soil liquefaction in the south are the major worries.
Areas hit by liquefaction will be turned into parks and sports fields and memorials.
Nugroho declined to speculate on how long it would take to build new houses.
The chief executive of the World Bank, Kristalina Georgieva, offered Indonesia various help on Wednesday including financing for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and neighborhood-level infrastructure and services.
Georgieva made the offer in talks with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla on the sidelines of annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on the resort island of Bali.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami.

In 2004, a quake off the north Indonesia island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Last week, Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of the former chairman of Azerbaijan's largest bank, lost an appeal at the High Court against an attempt by the British authorities to seize two properties worth about 22 million pounds using a new Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). 
Hajiyeva's husband Jahangir Hajiyev, who was chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan, the country's only state-owned bank, from 2001 to 2015, was convicted of fraud and embezzlement in October 2016 and sentenced to 15 years in jail.

""Unexplained Wealth Orders have the potential to significantly reduce the appeal of the UK as a destination for illicit income.""

It was not clear where the boat was headed or where it left from. Hundreds of thousands of migrants crossed the sea channel from Turkey to Greek territory in 2015 before Ankara curbed the flow under a deal it struck with the European Union.
The coast guard said the boat sank off the coast of Turkey's Izmir province after water began leaking shortly after its departure. Search and rescue operations for the missing migrants were continuing, a coast guard statement said. It said there were initially around 35 migrants on the boat in total.
Turkey became one of the main launch points for more than a million migrants taking the sea route to EU territory in 2015, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
The influx of migrants was drastically curtailed by a 2016 accord between Ankara and the EU, after hundreds died crossing to Greek islands a few miles off the Turkish shore.
Mediterranean arrivals to the bloc, including refugees making the longer and more perilous crossing from North Africa to Italy, totaled 172,301 in 2017, down from 362,753 in 2016 and 1,015,078 in 2015, according to United Nations data.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oxfam on Wednesday rejected Singapore's defense of its low taxes after the NGO ranked the wealthy city state among the 10 worst-offending countries in fuelling inequality with its low-tax regime.
Oxfam's Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) index ranked Singapore 149th of 157, below Afghanistan, Algeria, and Cambodia, and marginally higher than Haiti, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
The index assesses social spending, taxation and labor policies. It ranked Denmark, Germany and Finland as the top three.
Oxfam's head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, said the impact of Singapore's tax policy went beyond its borders, serving as a tax haven for the rich and big corporations.
""Singapore's harmful tax practices mean that they are eroding the revenue of other countries in the region and globally, revenues that those countries could be investing in schools and hospitals,"" Lawson told Reuters.
Singapore Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee said on Tuesday public service in terms of the standard of education and health care, as well as affordability of housing, spoke loudly about Singapore's social policy accomplishments.
""Yes, the income tax burden on Singaporeans is low. And almost half the population do not pay any income tax,"" Lee said in a statement.
""Yet, they benefit more than proportionately from the high quality of infrastructure and social support that the state provides,"" he said. ""In Oxfam's view, Singapore's biggest failing is our tax rates, which are not punitive enough.""
Lee also said 90 percent of Singaporeans owned their homes and home ownership was 84 percent even among the poorest 10 percent of households. ""No other country comes close,"" he said.

""We set out to achieve real outcomes for our people - good health, education, jobs and housing - rather than satisfy a collection of ideologically driven indicators.""

MADRID (Reuters) - At least six people including two Britons were killed as heavy rain and flash floods hit the Spanish island of Mallorca late on Tuesday, authorities said.
Torrents of brown water swept cars along narrow streets in the eastern town of Sant Llorenc. Rivers burst their banks and swamped roads and people's homes - forcing some to take shelter in a sports center in the nearby town of Manacor.
At least another nine people were still missing after the downpours, El Pais and other media reported, though emergency services said they could not confirm that figure. 
Two of the victims were British, a senior official from the San Llorenc mayor's office, Antonia Bauza, told radio station Cadena Ser.
""It's been a huge storm. In just two hours, some 180 liters of rain fell and we realized that we could not control the water,"" Bauza said. 
""The situation is a disaster and we're trying to locate survivors and help people but everything is flooded and people cannot leave their homes,"" she added.
Residents swept water and mud out of those houses as the floods subsided early on Wednesday, leaving roadsides strewn with wrecked vehicles and beaches covered in debris.
The regional government called an emergency meeting and authorities said rescue workers and military units had been sent to the area to help.
""My solidarity and support goes out to the families and friends of victims and all those affected by these tragic floods,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Twitter.

SOFIA (Reuters) - A Bulgarian man has been detained in Germany over the rape and murder of television journalist Viktoria Marinova, officials said on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said journalists in Bulgaria had total freedom to write and report.
The suspect was arrested on Tuesday at the request of Bulgaria, Interior Minister Mladen Marinov told a news briefing attended by Borissov and the country's chief prosecutor.
He has been charged over the killing and Bulgarian authorities were expecting Germany to extradite him to Bulgaria, Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said.
The Interior Ministry of the German state of Lower Saxony confirmed that a 20-year old suspect has been arrested in the city of Stade in the home of relatives' on Tuesday night and was due to be brought before a magistrate on Wednesday.
The body of the 30-year-old journalist, who police said hadbeen raped, beaten and suffocated, was found on Saturday.
On her last TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced two journalists who were investigating suspected corruption involving EU funds and said her own show, ""Detector"", on local television station NTV, would carry out similar investigations.
No link has been established to her work so far and Borissov criticized Bulgarians who he said had rushed to mention Bulgaria along with Malta and Slovakia, where journalists had been killed recently for their work. 
Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta's best-known investigative reporter, was killed when a bomb blew up her car in October last year and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February. 
Borissov said journalists in Bulgaria had ""total freedom to write and report on any topic"".
""We have done all this work in the frame of three days. In the frame of three days I read monstrous things about Bulgaria and none of which was true,"" he said.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker praised the Bulgarian authorities' efforts.
""The swift reaction and joint efforts demonstrate the resolve to bring justice for such despicable acts. Our thoughts remain with Viktoria Marinova's family and friends,"" he said in a statement.
The suspect was identified as Severin Krasimirov from Ruse, who lived near the park where Marinova's body was found. He left the country on Sunday, the interior minister told reporters.
Chief Prosecutor Tsatsarov told the news conference that he could not say at this stage if the murder was linked to Marinova's work as a journalist. The collected evidence so far pointed to a spontaneous attack and sexual assault, he said.
""We have collected a lot of evidence which for the time being suggests that the person is guilty. He has been charged in absence for two crimes - rape and premeditated murder with extreme cruelty,"" Tsatsarov said.
Her death has shocked and angered many in Bulgaria, where people are frustrated with corruption and an inefficient judiciary that has been criticized by the European Commission.
Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other European Union member.

The European Commission has urged Bulgaria to conduct a rapid investigation and the U.S. Embassy said it was shocked by the ""horrific murder"".

Ashers Baking in Belfast was found guilty of discrimination in 2015 for refusing to make a cake for a customer bearing the words ""Support Gay Marriage"" and a picture of characters Bert and Ernie from the television show Sesame Street.
It failed in an appeal to the local courts in 2016 but the Supreme Court, the UK's highest judicial body, overturned that decision, saying the bakers' objection was to the message on the cake, not to any personal characteristics of the messenger, or anyone with whom he was associated.
The bakery, which initially accepted the order from Gareth Lee, a gay rights activist, but later contacted him to cancel it and refund his money, would have refused to make such a cake for any customer irrespective of their sexual orientation, the court said.
""This conclusion is not in anyway to diminish the need to protect gay people and people who support gay marriage,"" said Brenda Hale, President of the Supreme Court. 
""It is deeply humiliating and an affront to human dignity to deny someone the service because of that person's race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or belief but that is not what happened in this case.""
Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where same-sex marriage is not allowed. 
The socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the province's largest political party that also props up Britain's minority government, has blocked attempts to legalize gay marriage. Party leader, Arlene Foster, retweeted news of the judgment as soon as it was handed down.
Northern Ireland's Equality Commission, which backed Lee's case, said it was disappointed with the judgment and the implications that the beliefs of business owners may take precedence over a customer's equality rights.
""There is a concern that this judgment may raise uncertainty about the application of equality law in the commercial sphere, both about what businesses can do and what customers may expect,"" it said in a statement.

Pension reform is crucial for any effort to reduce Brazil's gaping budget deficit and out-going President Michel Temer has hoped his plan could be approved before he hands over to a successor on Jan. 1.
But Onyx Lorenzoni, who is slated to become Bolsonaro's chief of staff if the former Army captain wins a run-off later this month, said on Tuesday that Temer's proposal should be dropped and a new plan drawn up.
""Jair did not support that reform proposal, nor did I, nor did most of the people who back Bolsonaro, because it is a bad proposal, it is a piece of filth that resolves nothing,"" Lorenzoni told reporters.
His comments added to concerns about contradictions emerging in Bolsonaro's team of advisors on how to handle key issues such as pension reform, which investors see as top priority for the next government to bring an unsustainable deficit under control.
Bolsonaro, a conservative congressman favored by financial markets, fell just short of an outright majority in Sunday's election. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, in a second round ballot on Oct. 28
Bolsonaro's chief economic advisor Paulo Guedes, a free-market University of Chicago-trained economist, has a plan similar to Temer's that would get Brazilians to contribute more to the pension system by introducing a minimum retirement age.
Yet another close aide to Bolsonaro, former military police Major Olimpio Gomes, a Congressman who won a Senate seat on Sunday, has opposed pension reform outright. He called the current proposal in Congress an ""exterminating"" bill.
Conflicting statements on whether to re-introduce a loathed tax on financial transactions called the CPMF or to abolish a 13th monthly salary bonus paid every year to employees in Brazil have shown that Bolsonaro has yet to come up with a coherent economic program. 
While his economic guru Guedes wants to zero the budget deficit in a year or two, Bolsonaro went on national television on Monday night promising to cut income taxes and offer payroll tax breaks for companies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Programs run by some European Union countries to sell passports and residency permits to wealthy foreign citizens pose risks of money laundering as some of the schemes are not properly managed, campaign groups said on Wednesday.
Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries: Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and France. Hungary has terminated its program.
""If you have a lot of money that you acquired through dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from the place you stole from isn't just appealing, it's sensible,"" Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to corruption and money laundering risks.
The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency International urged the European Union to set standards for managing the schemes and to extend anti-money laundering rules, applied so far to banks or gaming firms, to all those involved in the visa-for-sale industry.
The European Commission is expected to publish a report on schemes in EU countries by December, an EU official said.
Acquiring these documents costs on average 900,000 euros, but Cyprus' passport could cost up to 2 millions, the report said. 
Cyprus has raised 4.8 billion euros ($5.51 billion) from its scheme, while Portugal could earn nearly a billion euros a year, according to figures cited in the report, called ""European Getaway – Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas"".
EU states generated around 25 billion euros in foreign direct investment in a decade from selling at least 6,000 passports and nearly 100,000 residency permits, the report said using what it called conservative estimates.
The report said in Malta, which has raised 718 million euros from its scheme, applicants who have criminal records or are under investigation could still be considered eligible ""in special circumstances"". 
""Poorly managed schemes allow corrupt individuals to work and travel unhindered throughout the EU and undermine our collective security,"" Laure Brillaud, anti-money laundering expert at Transparency International, said.
All the countries who run these schemes, except Britain, Cyprus, Ireland and Bulgaria, are part of the Schengen free-movement area which comprises 26 European states.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pressure is building on major Indian employers to take allegations of sexual harassment more seriously after a surge in the number of complaints against prominent public figures in the past week. 
At least one major Indian newspaper, some politicians and women's groups have said that the requirements of the 2013 Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act need to be enforced by companies and organizations, and if necessary by the authorities.
The #MeToo movement, that began in the U.S. more than a year ago with decades of allegations of sexual harassment against the film producer Harvey Weinstein, gained traction in India in late September after the actress Tanushree Dutta said prominent actor Nana Patekar behaved inappropriately on the sets of a film they were shooting in 2008. Patekar has denied any wrongdoing.
Since then, more than a dozen men in the media, entertainment, arts and political worlds have been accused of offences, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. 
India is traditionally a conservative country where discussions about sex are still taboo for many, and where women have long lagged behind men in workplace participation.
Hundreds of millions of Indians also work in the informal economy, or in small businesses where official channels of complaint are scarce, and the #MeToo movement will have little leverage.
The sexual harassment law stipulates any organization with more than ten employees should have an independent committee to investigate allegations.
But critics say that many organizations are not adhering to the letter of the law, or only paying lip service to it. 
""The committees required to address these complaints and grievances are either not properly constituted or simply do not exist,"" said TK Rajalakshmi, president of the India Women's Press Corps, that lobbies for the rights of female journalists.
""The fact that many of the complaints have gone unheard despite being brought to the notice of the appropriate authorities is disturbing and a matter of grave concern."" 
An editorial in the Economic Times, one of India's leading business publications, said on Tuesday that too often these committees have been ""dysfunctional or ineffective"". 

""The cost of complaining has been too high,"" it said. ""It is time to implement the law more effectively, both in letter and in spirit.""

Ahead of a general election scheduled for next year, supporters of the Shinawatras, backed by poor, rural voters, accuse the military government, which took power after a 2014 coup, of seeking to hobble the family and its allies. 
The military government denies it is singling out the family. 
On Wednesday, Panthongtae Shinawatra, 38, also known by his nickname ""Oak"", was accompanied on his visit to the authorities by both his sisters and many senior members of the Thaksin-backed Puea Thai Party.
""Panthongtae Shinawatra will be prosecuted...on charges of money laundering and conspiring to launder money of the amount of 10 million baht,"" the Attorney General said in a statement.
Last year, authorities formally charged him with having received a cheque for 10 million baht ($304,000) in 2004, in relation to a prior corruption case over fraudulent loans of 9.9 billion baht made by state-owned Krungthai Bank when his father was prime minister.
Panthongtae declined to speak to reporters. His lawyer declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
""I believe that Oak did not know the money he received came from wrongdoing,"" Watana Muangsook, a member of the Puea Thai Party, told reporters.
If found guilty of the charges, Panthongtae could face a jail term of up to 10 years.
Thaksin, whose populist movement's struggle with the Thai establishment has dominated politics for more than a decade, lives in exile after fleeing Thailand to escape a jail sentence for corruption following his overthrow in a 2006 coup.
His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, overthrown as prime minister in 2014, fled Thailand in August last year to avoid conviction in a criminal negligence case she said was politically motivated.
Later, she was sentenced in absentia to five years in jail.

May has 315 lawmakers and governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10 lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), though rebels in her own party say 40 of her lawmakers could vote against her deal.
The Times said a group of between 30 to 40 Labour lawmakers could defy their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and vote for a deal that May hopes to bring back by the end of the year.
In one scenario being discussed, Labour lawmakers would initially vote down any deal to prove loyalty to the leadership, but if parliamentary deadlock remained the rebels would back any deal that prevented a chaotic departure, The Times said.
If lawmakers reject a deal, May could fall and Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement, a move investors and company chiefs say would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade.

Without a deal the United Kingdom would move from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen vowed on Wednesday to boost national security, saying her government would not submit to Chinese suppression as Beijing ramps up pressure to assert its sovereignty over the self-ruled island.
Tsai's remarks came weeks ahead of islandwide local elections in late November that are seen as a bellwether for her ruling party's performance in presidential elections due in 2020. 
""At this time, China's intimidation and diplomatic pressure not only hurts relations between both sides, but seriously challenges the peaceful stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" she said in a National Day speech in Taipei. 
Taiwan will increase its defence budget every year to ensure it can defend its sovereignty, Tsai said, by upgrading military capabilities and self-sufficiency, including resuming domestic development of advanced training aircraft and submarines.
China, which views Taiwan as a wayward province, has increased military and diplomatic pressure on Taipei, leading to a difficult period for the president and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Three former allies - El Salvador, Burkina Faso and Dominican Republic - switched their allegiances to Beijing this year, and the Chinese military has stepped up encirclement drills around Taiwan, which Tapei has denounced as intimidation. [nL3N1SI2ZD] 
Taiwan must work with other countries to build a coalition to defend democracy, Tsai said, thanking the European Parliament and the United States for their support.
Last month, the U.S. State Department approved the sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16 fighter planes and other military aircraft worth up to $330 million, a move China has said jeopardises Sino-U.S. cooperation. [nL2N1WA1MH] [nL2N1WP0R5]
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and regularly calls the island its most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States. 
Relations with Beijing have nosedived since Tsai came into office in 2016, with China suspecting that she wants to push for formal independence, a red line for Beijing.
For her part, Tsai has repeatedly emphasized maintaining the status quo since coming to power.
On Wednesday she called for a multi-national effort to fight some types of infiltration, such as the circulation of fake news by certain countries, which she did not name.

""I would like to pledge to everyone that we will not rashly increase antagonism, but we won't submit or yield,"" she said.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2018 02:41AM ET</span>",Some Hong Kong lawmakers walk out of policy address over media 'persecution',"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some Hong Kong lawmakers walked out of the Legislative Council as city leader Carrie Lam was about to give her annual policy address on Wednesday, protesting against the rejection of a work visa for a senior British journalist.
Chanting ""Protect media freedoms"" and holding placards that said ""Free Press. No Persecution"", around a dozen pro-democracy lawmakers left the chamber before Lam gave a 45-minute speech laying out policy priorities for the former British colony.
The protest came after Hong Kong last week rejected a visa renewal application from Victor Mallet, the Asia editor for the Financial Times newspaper, who in August hosted a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club by a pro-independence activist.
Hong Kong authorities and Lam have so far refused to explain the visa decision.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including freedom of the press, not enjoyed elsewhere in China.
But talk of independence is anathema to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.
""We were expressing our anger and disgust at Carrie Lam,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo who took part in the protest.
""She is practically turning Hong Kong into an international joke ... She's quite determined to rule by fear.""
The FCC, one of Asia's leading press clubs, said it neither endorsed nor opposed the views of its speakers, but was an institution defending the right to free speech.
The visa denial has kicked off a storm of protest and has drawn criticism from the United States and Britain. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday suggested the visa rejection was ""politically motivated"" and he called on authorities to reconsider.
Critics say China's authoritarian reach is creeping further into Hong Kong.
""Authorities in mainland China routinely restrict people’s ability to engage in peaceful advocacy and public discussions on grounds of 'national security' by using this vaguely and broadly defined concept as a pretence to place unjustified restrictions on the exercise of these freedoms,"" Amnesty International wrote in a statement.
""The government in Hong Kong also seems to be pursuing a broadened concept of 'national security'.""
""RED LINE""
Since taking office last July, Lam has faced several challenges including an economy and financial markets left vulnerable by the U.S.-China trade war, and one of the world's most expensive property markets.
Political tensions between democracy and independence activists resisting China's tightening grip on the city have continued to simmer.
In her speech, Lam gave her strongest warning yet against those seeking to split Hong Kong from China.
""Hong Kong will not tolerate any acts that advocate Hong Kong's independence and threaten the country's sovereignty, security and development interests.
""We will fearlessly take actions against such acts according to the law in order to safeguard the interests of the country and Hong Kong,"" Lam wrote in a full text version of her address.
Senior Chinese officials including President Xi Jinping have warned any undermining of national sovereignty is a ""red line"" that cannot be crossed.
Some Chinese officials and pro-Beijing politicians have stepped up calls in recent months for Hong Kong to enact new national security laws under Article 23 of the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
This provision states that Hong Kong must enact laws to prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese government.
An attempt to introduce such legislation in 2003, however, drew nearly half a million protesters on to the streets, leading to its eventual shelving.
Lam reiterated in her policy address that Hong Kong is duty-bound to enact such laws, but only when there is a ""favorable social environment"".
She didn't specify a timeframe.

""This issue has aroused extensive public concern and intense discussion on the legislation for Article 23,"" she said. ""I will listen to these views earnestly and explore ways to enable the Hong Kong society to respond positively to this constitutional requirement.""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia's al Shabaab Islamists on Tuesday shot five men in a public execution, including a Somali British citizen accused of spying, a sign of the insurgents' control of southern swathes of the country, even as authorities step up efforts to combat them.
Al Shabaab's grip on the Horn of Africa nation has been weakening since it was pushed out of the capital by African Union peacekeepers in 2011, but the government and the U.S. military are beefing up an offensive against it.
""Five of them were publicly shot to death this afternoon after they admitted espionage before the court,"" said Mohamed Abu Abdalla, al Shabaab's governor for the Jubba regions.
""Awale Ahmed Mohamed, 32 spied for MI6 and he came from Britain to Somalia to establish Islamic State,"" he told Reuters late on Tuesday.
Three of the men spied for the United States and helped guide drones to carry out strikes in Somalia, while a fourth spied for the Somali government, he added.
The government did not return telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment.
The U.S. drones often carry out strikes against the Somali militants, with the U.S. military saying it killed one militant in an air strike in southern Somalia over the weekend.
Al Shabaab is trying to overthrow Somalia's weak, U.N.-backed government and impose a strict form of Islamic law. The country has been torn apart by civil war since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator before turning on each other.

During a meeting on Monday, local Communist leaders said they would also require government officials and party members to firmly believe in Marxism-Leninism and speak standard Mandarin Chinese in public, according to a notice posted on the official Wechat account of the Urumqi procuratorate.
China has been subject to heavy criticism from rights groups and foreign governments amid reports of a punitive crackdown that has seen the detention of as many as 1 million mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang.
But Beijing has denied accusations that it is systematically violating the rights of Xinjiang's Muslims, saying it is only cracking down on extremism and ""splittism"" in the region. 
Urumqi is currently taking action against the so-called ""pan-Halal tendency"", a name given to the demands by Muslims that products such as milk or toothpaste comply with Islamic rituals.
The official Global Times said on Wednesday that the ""demand that things be halal which cannot really be halal"" were fuelling hostility towards religion and allowing Islam to penetrate secular life.
Chinese citizens are theoretically free to practice any religion, but they have been subject to increasing levels of surveillance as the government tries to bring religious worship under stricter state control.
Beijing has repeatedly cracked down on unauthorized religious activity, and last month issued new draft guidelines to crack down on the illegal online dissemination of religious information.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 09:28PM ET</span>",China Communist Party to take action against excessive inspections,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party said late on Tuesday that it would impose limits on the number of central government inspection campaigns directed at local authorities, saying local officials were at risk of being ""overwhelmed"".
In a notice posted by state news agency Xinhua, the General Office of the Communist Party's Central Committee said grassroots officials had become prone to bureaucratic thinking as a result of excessive supervision and inspection. 
The constant need to comply with central government inspections and assessments also led local officials to choose form over substance when it came to implementing policies, and normal operations were being disrupted, it added.
The notice said central government organs would no longer be permitted to launch their own inspections without the authorization of the State Council, China's cabinet.
The central government should carry out comprehensive inspections once a year involving multiple ministries, in order to avoid duplication, it said. Inspection work should be coordinated by the general office and the cabinet in the form of an annual plan.
China's central government has traditionally struggled to impose its will on local authorities worried about the impact of new legislation on jobs and economic growth. It has been trying to crack down on grassroots corruption as well as so-called ""protective umbrellas"", in which local authorities shield enterprises from costly state policies in areas like environmental protection.
It said in August that it would launch a nationwide campaign to ascertain how well policies in areas like poverty alleviation, environmental protection and the revitalization of the rural economy were being carried out.
But a tough environmental campaign last year also raised concerns that Beijing was trying to impose ""one size fits all"" restrictions on regions whether they complied with clean production standards or not.
China was also forced to take action against ""perfunctory"" or ""fraudulent"" compliance on the part of local governments and enterprises, with officials accused of gaming the system by tampering with monitoring equipment or manipulating emissions data.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 07:33PM ET</span>",Japan's women sailors serve on frontline of gender equality,"By Tim Kelly
ABOARD JS KAGA (Reuters) - Women serving on Japan's biggest warship, the Kaga, are a tight-knit group on the frontline of a push to transform the Japanese navy into a mixed-gender fighting force, where men outnumber them more than 10 to one.
The Maritime Self Defence Force (MSDF) needs more women because falling birth rates mean it has too few men to crew warships in home waters or on helicopter carriers such as the Kaga, sailing in foreign waters to counter China's growing regional influence.
""Women all over the world are working in a wider number of areas and I think Japan needs to be a part of that,"" said petty officer Akiko Ihara, 31, standing beside one of the helicopters she helps to maintain. 
The proportion of women in the Kaga's 450-strong crew is about 9 percent, a level Japan is targeting for the military overall by 2030 from 6 percent now. That would still fall short of U.S., where 15 percent of people in uniform are women, and Britain with 10 percent.
""We all work in different teams around the ship but we are all friends,"" Ihara added. ""We do sometimes moan a little about our male colleagues.""
The nine-year veteran says she has encountered no workplace discrimination, and would challenge any man who thinks women are unsuited for military life to work with her.
(For accompanying package, click on https://reut.rs/2pHU2ab)
More women recruits are making the SDF a more ""rounded"" organization, said Ayako Yoneda, 29, a firefighter and engineer on the Kaga. 
""When I first joined nine years ago there were few women and it felt like men then didn't know how to deal with us,"" she said. ""I think the men now see things more from our perspective. The SDF has become a gentler place.""Nonetheless, the women do face sexual harassment. In July, the navy discharged a male petty officer for kissing and groping three women sailors over several months. 
LURING WOMEN
Japan's demographic woes are forcing it down a path taken years earlier by its U.S. ally, which lifted a ban on women on warships in 1993. 
The MSDF, which let women crew ships a decade ago, could soon remove the last major barrier to female sailors by ending a ban on submarine duty, defense ministry sources have told Reuters.
Japan has one of the world's largest navies, with 45,000 crew on more than 100 vessels, including about 20 submarines, more than 40 destroyers and four helicopter carriers, such as the Kaga. 
The Kaga was on its way to Sri Lanka after drills in the contested South China Sea as part of a two-month deployment in waters stretching from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean.
Commissioned in 2017, it is among a new generation of warships designed to accommodate mixed crews, with more toilets and bathrooms than older vessels.
Signs at the entrance to the women's segregated sleeping quarters warn men to keep out. The women inside carry electronic pagers that can be contacted via numerical keypads beside the doors.
Those better facilities and privacy safeguards will draw more women to sign up, the MSDF hopes.
Japan's navy struggles more to find recruits than the air force or army, as young people balk at the prospect of being cut off from social media networks on long deployments.
In 2016, for example, the airforce received 6,900 applications, versus just 3,927 for the MSDF, even though both have about the same number of enlisted personnel. 
Miku Ihara, 22, a woman cadet on the Kaga, says she reads books or studies when off-duty, but misses access to Line and Instagram. Sailors are limited to sending four text emails every day when at sea. 
""You just have to get used to not having it and make the most of it when you do,"" she added.
The presence of women on board has had one unexpected benefit on the men that report to him, says Command Master Chief Yasuharu Tohno, the most senior enlisted sailor on board.

""They shave regularly and iron their clothes,"" said Tohno, who joined up to an all-male fleet 35 years ago.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",Brazil's far-right Bolsonaro: No coalition politics in cabinet picks,"By Bruno Federowski and Carolina Mandl
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Far-right Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro vowed on Tuesday to appoint non-partisan ministers, breaking with the tradition of building cabinets through coalitions, as part of his bid to tackle graft in Latin America's largest economy.
Bolsonaro, a conservative congressman favored by financial markets, fell just short of an outright majority in Sunday's vote. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, in a second round ballot on Oct. 28. 
With a commanding lead in the first round - he won 46 percent of the vote to Haddad's 29 percent - and a tidal wave of support lifting his congressional allies, Bolsonaro says he has the capital to fundamentally change the political process.
That would start with a more technocratic cabinet, potentially led by another conservative congressman, Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro said in a video posted on social media with Lorenzoni by his side.
""Once we get there, let's build a team of ministers committed to the future of Brazil and not political and partisan interests,"" Bolsonaro said. ""And who knows, Onyx here as chief of staff in Brasilia, okay?""
The 63-year-old former army captain has said he would like to appoint several generals to cabinet posts in an effort to depoliticize senior government roles and root out corruption schemes exposed by huge graft investigations in recent years.
Without senior cabinet posts to secure allied parties, however, the right-wing firebrand could struggle to keep a governing coalition together in a more fragmented Congress that will be divided between 30 parties next year.
Bolsonaro is also looking to put business leaders in government roles, a newspaper reported on Tuesday, including a possible invitation to the head of global markets at Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil SA to lead the central bank if current governor Ilan Goldfajn declines to stay on.
Roberto Campos Neto, who also runs the trading desk of Santander Brasil, is one of several executives being considered to run ministries and state enterprises, Folha reported without saying how it obtained the information.
The newspaper also reported that Alexandre Bettamio, chief executive for Latin America at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), could take over as CEO of state-run lender Banco do Brasil SA. 
The Bolsonaro campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither Campos Neto nor Bettamio could be immediately reached for comment.
Haddad, in a radio interview, would not reveal who he is considering for his cabinet if he wins the second-round vote, but he said the finance minister would ""not be a banker."" 
Brazil emerged last year from its deepest economic recession in decades, which wiped out much of the prosperity generated during the previous decade when the country was a darling of emerging market investors.
MARKET-FRIENDLY CONVERSION 
Roberto de Oliveira Campos, a grandfather of the Santander Brasil banker, served as planning minister in the early years of Brazil's 1964-1985 military government, when pro-U.S. views and free-market policies earned him the nickname ""Bob Fields.""
Bolsonaro, an outspoken apologist for the dictatorship, in the past defended nationalist, interventionist economic policies with which the military government spurred an inflationary economic boom in the 1970s, after Campos left the government.
Since Bolsonaro launched his presidential campaign, he has declared his conversion to more market-friendly policies advocated by his main economic advisor, University of Chicago-trained banker Paulo Guedes.
Guedes told Reuters in the past that Bolsonaro could invite Goldfajn, a former executive at the nation's largest private-sector bank, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, to continue leading the central bank.
However, Goldfajn has strong ties to the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), formerly Brazil's most important right-of-center party, which has lost space to Bolsonaro's more hard-right Social Liberal Party (PSL).
According to the Folha report, Bolsonaro has not yet issued any formal invitations and would only do so once he is elected, but he is considering the appointment of executives that have advised his campaign.
Folha cited João Cox, chairman of telecom TIM Participações SA; Sergio Eraldo de Salles Pinto, an executive at investment firm Bozano Investimentos, which Guedes founded; and Maria Silvia Bastos, former president of state development bank BNDES and now head of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Brazil.

The executives could not immediately be reached for comment through their companies.

PORT-DE-PAIX (Reuters) - The weekend earthquake which battered Haiti killed 17 people, authorities said on Tuesday, and damaged or destroyed nearly 2,500 houses, sparking fears that many buildings are in a precarious state in the impoverished Caribbean country.
The shallow, magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck northern Haiti on Saturday, spreading panic, particularly around Port-de-Paix, a coastal town that absorbed the brunt of the shockwave.
Two more people were confirmed dead on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 17, according to Haiti's civil protection agency. Another 333 people were injured, it said. Prime Minister Jean Henry Ceant said 2,280 houses were damaged and 168 destroyed.
The quake, centered just off the north coast, was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake near Port-au-Prince killed tens of thousands of people in 2010.
There have been several aftershocks, causing alarm around Port-de-Paix, particularly inside the local prison.
""The prison walls are all cracked by the earthquake, and the building may collapse and kill all of us any time,"" inmate Dosty Pierre, 30, said from his prison cell.
He and other prisoners urged authorities to move them.
The national administrative police chief, Carl-Henry Boucher, told Reuters that the penitentiary authorities in the capital were working on the issue, but could not say when the prisoners would be moved to a different jail.
On Sunday, prisoners organized a riot to escape and got out of their cells, but guards and riot police foiled the jail break, said Jackson Hilaire, police chief for the northwest region.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit minister Dominic Raab voiced confidence on Tuesday that Britain and the European Union would make progress on their divorce at a summit next week, but again asked the bloc to meet London ""halfway"" on the most difficult areas.
Brexit negotiations have stepped up before the summit next Wednesday and Thursday, and the EU has signaled that its officials believe a deal is within grasp. But one of the most difficult obstacles to securing the so-called withdrawal agreement, the Irish border, has yet to be resolved.
With just six months before Britain leaves the EU in its biggest shift in trade and foreign policy in more than 40 years, both sides say they are intensifying talks to try to avoid a ""no deal"" Brexit that could harm the world's fifth largest economy.
""The October council next week of course will be an important milestone - we expect that to be a moment where we will make some progress,"" Raab told parliament when asked why he was no longer suggesting there could be a deal at the meeting.
""The negotiations were always bound to be tough in the final stretch. That's all the more reason why we should hold our nerve, stay resolute and focused, and I remain confident we will reach a deal this autumn.""
Britain is keen to move forward on a future relationship, especially after Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals, already in doubt among many of her governing Conservatives, were widely criticized at an EU summit in Austria last month.
At his latest appearance in parliament, where divisions over how to leave the EU were on display, Raab moved to downplay one of the thorniest parts of the talks - a so-called backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
He again said that a future partnership that ensured frictionless trade would mean there would be no need for such a backstop, which would only be used if there was no agreement, or if the two sides were not ready to put that deal, in place.
""We want to pursue the frictionless trade with the EU that we have now, and that's what our proposal will deliver. But of course it requires the EU to meet us half way,"" Raab said.
""RED LINE""
How to prevent the return of a hard border, which some say could reignite sectarian divisions on the island of Ireland, has become one of the hardest hurdles to clear for both sides.
The small Northern Irish party which props up May's government again drew what it described as the ""only one red line"" in its talks in Brussels on Tuesday, ruling out any checks on trade with the British mainland after Brexit.
""We could not support any arrangement which could give rise to either customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal market,"" Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said after meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
In parliament, her deputy Nigel Dodds rammed the point home, warning Raab not to ""repeat that mistake"" from December - when the DUP almost pulled the rug out from an interim accord negotiated by May by scuppering a proposal that would have seen regulatory alignment between the EU and the province.
Raab reiterated that the government would not do anything to compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, adding that officials had long cautioned that any deal could be pushed back to a special meeting in November. 
But one EU diplomat was upbeat, saying the divorce deal, or withdrawal agreement, could be concluded by Monday and that officials were working on a proposal to avoid Britain having to come up with a separate backstop plan as a possible solution.

For now, the ""intense"" negotiations are ongoing.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",'Monstrous' Hurricane Michael menaces Florida,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - ""Monstrous"" Hurricane Michael bore down on northwestern Florida on Tuesday and was expected to strengthen into a powerful Category 3 storm before hitting land on Wednesday, triggering dangerous coastal flooding and bringing high winds and torrential rains.
Authorities told tens of thousands of residents and tourists in at least 20 Florida counties to evacuate coastal areas along the 200-mile (322 km) long Panhandle and Big Bend region. The storm was expected to hit land around midday Wednesday, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecaster Kenneth Widelski.
Michael, carrying top winds of 110 miles per hour (175 km per hour), caused major disruption to U.S. oil production as it headed north over the Gulf of Mexico.
It was expected to strengthen into a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before hitting land, said the National Hurricane Center, which classifies storms of Category 3 and above as major hurricanes. That would make it the most powerful storm to strike the Panhandle in more than a decade.
Authorities stressed the danger of the storm surge, when hurricanes push sea water high above their normal levels causing coastal flooding. Forecasters said Michael could cause a storm surge of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) above normal sea water levels in Florida.
""Hurricane Michael is a monstrous storm and the forecast just keeps getting more dangerous, we are now just hours from seeing impacts,"" Florida Governor Rick Scott said on Tuesday afternoon.
""If you don't follow warnings from officials this storm could kill you,"" said the Republican governor, who is campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat in the November congressional elections.
Producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday cut oil production by about 40 percent and natural gas output by 28 percent as Michael approached the coast, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said, citing reports from 27 companies.
The Gulf produces 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The partial shutdown ahead of Michael helped push oil prices slightly higher on Tuesday.
Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties in Florida's Panhandle and Big Bend regions, mostly rural areas known for small tourist cities, beaches and wildlife reserves, and the state capital, Tallahassee. 
The hurricane was forecast to deliver as much as 1 foot (30 cm) of rain in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Western Cuba was also forecast to get torrential rains.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency had numerous teams deployed and ready to respond, said FEMA spokesman Jeff Byard. About 2500 National Guard soldiers were assisting and more than 4,000 troops were on standby. Some 13,000 utility restoration workers were also on standby.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House the country was very well prepared for the hurricane, adding it was much bigger than had been expected. 
'BUTTONED UP, TIGHTENED DOWN'
In Panhandle counties, most state offices, schools and universities were closed for the rest of the week. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. 
Gary Givens, owner of Gary's Oyster Shack in Panama City, Florida, said he was closing his restaurant around lunchtime on Tuesday with the help of his crew ahead of the storm's arrival. But Givens said he was staying put because he owns two businesses in the area.
""I just got a crew that came in that are staying also and they're in here helping me get everything buttoned up, tightened down, getting the food secure,"" Givens said. 
Some Panama City residents were on the beach enjoying a cool breeze ahead of the storm, while others were loading up cars with luggage, and visitors were checking out of hotels. 
The last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle was Hurricane Dennis in 2005, according to hurricane center data. 
At 2 p.m. ET, Michael's center was about 310 miles (500 km) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida, heading north at around 12 mph (19 kph), the NHC said.
On its current track, it would hit land somewhere along a coastline that includes the cities and towns of Fort Walton Beach, Panama City Beach, Port St. Joe, St. Teresa and the wildlife reserves bordering Apalachee Bay. However, forecasters always note it is not possible to say where a hurricane will land until it is closer to the coast.
A hurricane warning was in effect for the coastline from the Florida-Alabama border to the Suwannee River in Florida.
Torrential downpours and flash flooding from the storm over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America.
The storm was forecast to move through the southeastern United States on Wednesday night and Thursday, passing through Georgia and the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. It would head off the Mid-Atlantic coast by Friday, the NHC said.

Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Tuesday for 92 counties in the state.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it would search Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul where Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi vanished last week, and close ally Britain called on Riyadh to provide ""urgent answers"" over his disappearance.
Khashoggi was last seen one week ago entering the consulate in Istanbul to get documents related to his forthcoming marriage. His fiancee, waiting outside, said he never emerged and Turkish sources said they believe Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policies, was killed inside the mission.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan asked Saudi Arabia on Monday to prove its assertion that Khashoggi left the consulate, while Washington urged the kingdom to support an investigation.
Saudi Arabia has dismissed as baseless accusations that it killed or abducted Khashoggi, and on Tuesday Turkey's state-owned Anadolu agency said Riyadh had invited Turkish experts and other officials to visit the consulate.
Britain urged the Saudi government to explain what happened. ""Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,"" foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter.
""Violence against journalists worldwide is going up and is a grave threat to freedom of expression. If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values,"" he wrote. 
Turkey's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said the investigation was ""continuing intensively"". The Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations allowed for consulates to be searched by authorities of a host country with consent of the mission chief, he said.
""The consulate building will be searched in the framework of the investigation,"" Aksoy said in a written statement.
There was no immediate comment on the report from the Saudi authorities.
Anadolu later reported that a private plane that had arrived from Saudi Arabia at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport was searched last Tuesday, the day Khashoggi was last seen. The search proved fruitless and the plane took off again afterwards, it said. 
A Turkish security source had previously told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country. 
It was not immediately clear if the Anadolu report referred to one of those aircraft.
""FORCED DISAPPEARANCE""
Khashoggi left his country last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Saudi policy over the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent, and since then wrote columns for the Washington Post. His disappearance sparked global concern.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had not yet spoken to Saudi officials about the case. Speaking at the White House, he said he did not know anything about Khashoggi's disappearance and that he would speak with Saudi officials at some point. 
The U.N. human rights office urged both Turkey and Saudi Arabia to investigate what it called the ""apparent enforced disappearance"" and possible murder of Khashoggi.
""We call for cooperation between Turkey and Saudi Arabia to conduct a prompt and impartial investigation into the circumstances of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and to make the findings public,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a Geneva news briefing.
The two countries have such an obligation under both criminal law and international human rights law, she said.
In July, the U.N. human rights office called on Saudi Arabia to release all peaceful activists, including women held for campaigning against a ban on driving as it was being lifted.
Khashoggi was once a Saudi newspaper editor and is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks. He used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
His disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
The two Turkish sources told Reuters on Saturday that Turkish authorities believe Khashoggi was deliberately killed inside the consulate, a view echoed by one of Erdogan's advisers, Yasin Aktay, who is a friend of the Saudi journalist.
Erdogan told reporters on Sunday that authorities were examining camera footage and airport records as part of their investigation. He has also said Turkey has no documents or evidence regarding the case.
The European Union fully supports U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called on Riyadh to investigate Khashoggi's disappearance, EU policy chief Federica Mogherini said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Tuesday more talks with Syria were needed before an important border crossing shut for three years as a result of its neighbor's war could reopen to serve regional trade.
The closure of the Nassib crossing in 2015 cut a crucial transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Turkey and the Gulf, and Lebanon and the Gulf, in multi-billion dollar annual trade.
Damascus, which retook the crossing from the opposition last July, hopes to reopen the Nassib route because it is vital to its hopes of reviving Syria’s shattered economy and rebuilding in territory under its control.
But Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said technical committees between the two countries which began talks in the middle of September were still working out the practical arrangements.
""The border will open after the technical committees end all the necessary arrangements and measures needed to guarantee opening the borders serves the common interests of the two countries,"" Safadi said after talks with his Lebanese counterpart.
Western diplomatic sources say staunch U.S. ally Amman is resisting Russian pressure to open the crossing as this would help Damascus show the war is ending and hand President Bashar al-Assad another major gain.
Backed by Iran and Russia, Assad's army has retaken control of most of Syria.
Jordan supports Washington and its Arab Gulf state allies in their tough stance toward Iran, a country Jordanian officials are wary of because of its growing military presence in Syria. 
Jordan has denied it agreed on a date to reopen the crossing after Syria announced on Sept. 29 that movement of traffic and goods had begun. Syria retracted that announcement later that day, saying it would reopen on Wednesday October 10.
Diplomats and officials have privately said the move appeared to signal mounting pressure by Damascus on Amman to speed up the opening of the crossing. Earlier, the Syrian authorities had said they had rehabilitated the crossing and it was ready to receive Syrian refugees. 
Lebanon's Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil in his visit to Amman lobbied Safadi for a speedy reopening, saying it would be a step toward stability in the war-torn country.
""There is big hope that Nassib opens soon so that traffic goes back to its former strength,"" Bassil told reporters.

Lebanon's economy minister told Reuters in July the crossing was ""a vital artery"" for the Lebanese economy where it is a conduit for millions of dollars of exports of fresh produce to lucrative Gulf markets.

RUSE, Bulgaria (Reuters) - Bulgarian police questioned a Romanian man about the murder of TV journalist Viktoria Marinova on Tuesday but released him without charge and the country remains under international pressure to solve the crime.
The body of the 30-year-old journalist, who police said had been raped, beaten and suffocated, was found on Saturday. The European Union and the United States have urged Bulgaria to bring the killer to justice.
""Our work is continuing. For the time being there are no facts and circumstances that we can announce. The Romanian citizen is to be released,"" Teodor Atanasov, the head of Danube regional police in Ruse, Marinova's hometown, told reporters. 
On her last TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced two journalists who were investigating suspected corruption involving EU funds and said her own show, ""Detector"", on local television station NTV, would carry out similar investigations.
No link has been established to Marinova's work, but her death has angered many in the Balkans country where people are frustrated with corruption and an inefficient judiciary that has been criticized by the European Commission.
The Commission urged Bulgaria to conduct a rapid investigation and the U.S. embassy said it was shocked by the ""horrific murder"". 
""U.S. is ready to help authorities if needed to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" it tweeted. 
The police have said they are looking into all possible motives but the founder of Bivol.bg, whose reporters were on Marinova's last show, said he feared authorities were downplaying the likelihood of links to her work. 
""I see deliberate attempts to marginalize this killing and manipulate the public opinion that Viktoria was a victim of a random attack or sexual manslaughter,"" Assen Yordanov said, adding that Marinova was the only TV journalist who had agreed to host his website's journalists to discuss the investigation.
Local people held a candlelight vigil overnight and many left flowers to commemorate Marinova, who left a seven-year-old daughter. 
""This is extremely frustrating. We do not feel safe at all or calm when such things happen. I did not know her personally, but as a mother I can only feel for her,"" said 28-year-old Denitsa Peicheva.
Relatives and colleagues called on people to be patient and expressed hope that the police would soon find the perpetrators.

""There will be time for anger! Just let it not be today,"" they said in a statement on NTV's website.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The co-founder of a group to raise awareness about schoolgirls kidnapped by jihadists said she aims to become Nigeria's first woman president by mobilizing first-time voters discouraged from going to the polls by the long domination of two main parties. 
Obiageli Ezekwesili, 55, also a former cabinet minister and senior World Bank official, announced on Sunday she would run as the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) in the February 2019 vote to decide who runs Agrefrica's most populous country and top energy producer. [nL8N1WN113] 
""I am now fed up, like most Nigerians are, with the status quo and so we want to disrupt our political landscape,"" Ezekwesili said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.
She and other candidates will line up against President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler who is seeking a second term, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar who is running for the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). 
Ezekwesili said the two main parties - the APC and the PDP, which have held power since the advent of civilian rule in 1999 - were all but indistinguishable. She called them ""Siamese twins"" that had done little to tackle endemic graft and poor governance. 
Political defections are common in Nigeria, where identity and patronage largely take precedence over ideology and specific policies. 
She said her campaign would seek to attract people who had not previously participated in elections - a group she said amounted to a majority of eligible voters. 
Independent Electoral Commission figures show that just 43 percent of people who registered to vote at the last election in 2015 actually went to the polls. Ezekwesili estimated that some 72 percent of eligible voters, including people who did not register, failed to turn out at the ballot box.
""They simply decided that the candidatures of the two parties they were being asked to vote for were not appealing to them, so they just elected to stay home,"" she said. 
""That base of 72 percent of people who should turn things around in the country, they are our target. We are going to activate that base,"" said Ezekwesili. 
But her ability to challenge the main contenders seems questionable given their larger spending firepower and access to key patronage networks in the nation of 190 million people. 
Policy proposals Ezekwesili hopes will lure more first-time voters to her candidacy include reforms of the state-owned oil company NNPC, which has been beset by decades of mismanagement and is crucial to the OPEC member's economic fortunes. Oil sales account for two-thirds of Nigerian state revenue. 
Ezekwesili also aims to enable the private sector to create more jobs and focus on developing skills in Nigeria's workforce. 
She served in a PDP government between 2000 and 2007, first as minerals minister and later education minister.
One of the founders of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, Ezekwesili also co-founded the Bring Back Our Girls campaign to promote efforts to free about 270 schoolgirls kidnapped in 2014 by Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

Chinese-ruled Hong Kong last week rejected an application to renew the work visa of Victor Mallet, the Asian news editor of the Financial Times who also serves as the vice-president of the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC).
It came two months after government officials in China and Hong Kong condemned the FCC for hosting a speech by an independence activist, Andy Chan, reigniting debate about the viability of the city's promised freedoms. Mallet chaired the event.
""In the absence of an explanation from the authorities we can only conclude that this move is politically motivated,"" Hunt said in a statement.
""I urge the Hong Kong authorities to reconsider this decision - confidence in Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms is an essential component of its future success,"" he added.
Mallet, who was traveling away from Hong Kong when his work visa renewal was refused, was allowed back into the city on Sunday but only on a seven-day tourist visa, rather than a six-month visa that is usual for British nationals.
The Financial Times said in an editorial at the weekend the incident ""sends a chilling message to everyone in Hong Kong, highlighting Beijing’s tightening grip on the territory and the steady erosion of basic rights that are guaranteed in Hong Kong’s laws and international agreements”.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the guarantee of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including freedom of the press, not enjoyed elsewhere in China.
But calls for outright independence are a red line for China's Communist Party leaders, who deem the global financial hub to be an inalienable part of the nation.
China's Foreign Ministry has defended Hong Kong's decision to refuse Mallet's visa.
""Since the return of Hong Kong ... everyone can see that Hong Kong's society and economy has achieved progress,"" spokesman Lu Kang said.

Hong Kong's right to protect its legitimate interests was ""beyond criticism"", he added.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament on Tuesday rejected Primoz Dolenc as the official candidate to head its central bank after most parties gave him the thumbs-down in a debate.
Dolenc, the bank's deputy governor since 2016, was nominated for the top job last month by President Borut Pahor but only received support from 30 parliamentary members with 39 voting against him. 
Slovenia lost its vote on the European Central Bank's governing council in April, when former governor Bostjan Jazbec resigned to take a position on the EU's Single Resolution Board. It will regain the vote only after it elects a governor.
The president is likely to nominate a new candidate in the coming weeks, although Slovenian law does not set a deadline for when a new central bank governor must be elected.
Jozef Horvat, of opposition party conservative New Slovenia, told parliament ahead of the vote he believed Dolenc's record at the bank showed his credentials were lacking.
""It is our belief that the Bank of Slovenia did not perform its supervisory function (over the country's banking sector) well ...,"" he told lawmakers.
Allegations of money laundering have plagued Slovenia's banking sector since it came close to seeking an international bailout in 2013.
Analysts said it will be difficult for Pahor to find a candidate who will get the necessary support because of the balance of power in the new parliament elected in June.
The minority center-left government, which took power last month, has been unable to agree on a joint candidate. 
Even if the five parties of the government coalition, which hold 43 out of 90 parliamentary seats, agree on a candidate, that person would also need at least three opposition votes to be elected.

""This vote is not a typical indication of how things will go in the future since Dolenc did not even enjoy support of the prime minister's party LMS but it indicates that the government will find it hard to secure majority in parliament for its projects,"" Meta Roglic, a political analyst of daily Dnevnik, told Reuters.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church wants to become fully self-governing, or autocephalous, and has sought the support of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, the spiritual leader of the world's roughly 250 million Orthodox Christians.
Seeking to prevent Ukraine's separation, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has written to all the self-governing Orthodox Churches calling for talks about the situation in Ukraine.
""The Greek Church examined the letter and will respond shortly,"" an official of the Greek Church told Reuters, requesting anonymity.
Asked what the response would contain, the source said: ""It will not be in favor of convening the Orthodox Churches to discuss the issue. It will also underline the need for unity among Orthodox churches.""
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church also turned down the Russian call last week.
The row over Ukraine is threatening a major rupture in Orthodoxy, which wields significant influence in certain countries where it is the dominant religion.
The Russian Church last month declared it would no longer take part in structures chaired by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which is expected to decide soon on whether it backs the independence call of the Kiev Church.
""The estimate is that the Ecumenical Patriarchate will examine the issue of autocephaly of Ukraine's church in the coming months, maybe by the end of October,"" the Greek official said.
""After that the Greek Church will decide its stance on the issue"".
The Ecumenical Patriarch, currently Bartholomew, does not wield the power enjoyed by the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church but is traditionally regarded as the 'first among equals' among the patriarchs of the self-governing Orthodox churches.

The Ecumenical Patriarch resides in the Turkish city of Istanbul, the former Constantinople, which has remained the historic seat of Orthodoxy despite its fall to the Muslim Turks in 1453.

Quim Torra, the Catalan regional head and Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) member, last week threatened to withdraw parliamentary support for Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in the national parliament, but coalition ally Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, Republican Left of Catalonia) did not back the move.
ERC leader Oriol Junqueras, who is currently in jail for his alleged role in organizing an illegal referendum on independence for the Catalonia region last year, said establishing a good relationship with the Spanish state and finding ""dialogue and agreements"" was the best way to resolve the secession crisis.
While the two parties had so far managed to resolve their tensions internally, they openly split on Tuesday when ERC teamed up with the socialist party to defeat a proposal of JxCat to allow exiled and jailed representatives to vote in the regional parliament.
Junqueras and another jailed ERC member, Raul Romeva, had previously agreed to transfer their votes to a member of their party, in line with a ruling from Spain's Supreme Court.
It is not yet clear whether those cracks could spell the end of the three-year-old pro-independence coalition, which controls the regional assembly and helped Sanchez win a confidence vote and topple conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy in June.
Junqueras on Twitter on Tuesday urged the two parties to stick together while JxCat said it would hold an extraordinary meeting on Friday to review its strategy.

Polls in Catalonia show a relatively even split between those who favor remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede. Sanchez has said he favors dialogue on the region's future but has ruled out any moves toward independence.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>","Zimbabwe police ban protests against new tax, citing cholera","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe police will stop planned protests by the labor movement against a new tax on money transfers on Thursday because of a standing order outlawing public gatherings in the capital following a cholera outbreak, its spokesman said.
The opposition has accused law officers of selectively applying the ban, saying supporters of President Emmerson Mnangagwa have been allowed to hold rallies in the capital while those for the opposition have been stopped.
With post-election turmoil two months ago in mind, the government appears resolved to keep a lid on demonstrations in opposition urban strongholds fearing they could spiral into violence, analysts say. Six people died in that violence which followed an army crackdown.
Although the labor movement has been weakened over the years due to high unemployment, it still maintains strong links with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, whose supporters would be likely to take part in the protests.
Fifty people have died and more than 10,000 have been infected in the biggest outbreak of cholera, a water borne disease, since 2008. 
Police spokesman Paul Nyathi said in a statement authorities would enforce the ban on gatherings to stop the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) protests in Harare.
However, Mnangagwa is on Wednesday expected to preside over the graduation of students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital. The event was initially suspended last month over the cholera outbreak.
Nyathi said ""the cholera outbreak is not yet over, particularly in Harare"" and warned potential protesters that ""if anything turns nasty those organizing the demonstrations will be held responsible.""
ZCTU president Peter Mutasa earlier told reporters that the labor body called for the strike against the new tax as well as a central bank decision to order banks to open accounts for clients who earn foreign currency and separate their money from dollars in the local banking system, known as ""Zollars"".
Businesses and ordinary people have objected to the 2 percent tax, arguing that it eats into their earnings while funding profligate spending by the government.
Over the last week, Zollars and the surrogate bond note currency have continued to lose value on the black market, causing a spike in prices and shortages of basic goods and medicines amid panic buying by citizens.
The southern African nation, which adopted the U.S. dollar after hyperinflation left its own currency worthless in 2009, is gripped by acute shortages of cash dollars that has seen prices of imports soar while businesses struggle to restock.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Britain's big Brexit vote: Will parliament back PM May?,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - If British Prime Minister Theresa May is able to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union in the coming weeks, she will face a crucial vote in parliament when she asks lawmakers to approve it.
How will the vote in parliament work?
WHAT DOES MAY HAVE TO DO? 
- If a deal has been agreed, May has to present to parliament:
1) A statement saying political agreement has been reached
2) The negotiated withdrawal agreement
3) The framework for the future relationship with the EU
- Ministers must also arrange a debate on the deal. In the directly elected lower house of parliament this will conclude with a vote on a motion stating that parliament has approved the deal. This is the big vote.
- Opponents of May's strategy are likely to try to put forward amendments to the government motion, which could be put to a separate vote. These could include changing the wording to make acceptance of the deal conditional upon it being approved by a referendum.
If any of these amendments pass, it would be considered a defeat for the government. Although not legally binding, they would be hard to ignore.
The order of votes - whether amendments are voted upon before the government motion, or vice versa - will be determined closer to the time.
- The unelected upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, will also debate the deal, but will only be asked to ""take note"" of it. The Lords will not get a straight ""approve"" or ""reject"" vote, and will not have the power to block the deal.
- The legislation defining the procedure for parliamentary approval does not specify how quickly after a deal is announced the vote will happen. It only stipulates that ministers should try to hold it before the European Parliament has its own vote. 
WHAT WILL LAWMAKERS VOTE ON?
Lawmakers will be voting on whether to approve a package consisting of:
1) The withdrawal agreement - a legal text setting out issues such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, a backstop for the Irish border, and the terms of an implementation period designed to smooth the exit process.
2) The future relationship framework - a non-legal document defining how Britain and the EU will work together in the long term on issues such as trade and security. 
These two documents define the deal May and her team have been negotiating with the European Commission since June 2017.
WHO GETS TO VOTE?
There are 650 elected lawmakers in Britain's House of Commons. Excluding non-voting members such as the speaker and others who never take up their seats, around 320 votes are needed to be certain of winning a vote. The actual number needed for victory depends on abstentions and absences on the day.
The vote is decided by a simple majority. Whichever side has more votes wins. 
HOW WILL THE RESULT BE ANNOUNCED?
At the end of the debate, the speaker will typically ask for those in favor of the motion to shout ""aye"", and then those against to say ""no"". As long as some lawmakers shout ""no"", the speaker will call for a formal vote, known as a division.
Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes - lawmakers return to the debating chamber.
Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the speaker, and one will read the result out loud. 
HOW WILL THE PARTIES VOTE?
The ruling Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10 lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
But May's party is not united behind her current plan. Euroskeptics think it leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, and pro-EU lawmakers say the ties are not close enough. Both groups are potentially large enough to inflict defeat.
The support of the 10 DUP lawmakers is dependent on the solution agreed on the Irish border. They have said they will not support any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the country.
The opposition Labour Party has 257 lawmakers. Led by Jeremy Corbyn, the party has pledged to vote down any deal that does not meet its criteria. The plans currently under discussion are unlikely to do this, so most Labour lawmakers can be expected to vote against May.
However, some who disagree with Corbyn's stance could rebel and vote with the government in order to avoid the risk of leaving without a deal. Media reports have said May is courting these Labour ""moderates"".
The Scottish National Party's 35 lawmakers are expected to vote against the government deal, as are the 12 Liberal Democrats.
IF MAY WINS, IS THAT IT?
No. Although the vote is the focal point for resistance to the deal, the government is also required to pass separate legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement and complete the ratification process.
This legislation will be known as the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. It will be subject to full scrutiny in parliament, involving multiple rounds of possible amending and voting. It has to be passed before March 29, 2019.
This process is unlikely to be used to unpick the deal as the legislation will be implementing what has already been approved by parliament. However, if parliament feels as if May has ignored its wishes and is forcing the deal through, it could use the bill to stall the exit process.
WHAT IF MAY LOSES?
This would be a politically explosive outcome that could topple May and her government. There are legislative guidelines on what happens next, but they could be overtaken by events.
By law, if the government motion is rejected, ministers have 21 days to set out in a statement how they intend to proceed. The government has said that if their deal is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal.
It then has to call a fresh debate in parliament that could give lawmakers another chance to set out amendments - effectively giving parliament a vote on an alternative path. These amendments would not be binding, but if approved May would again find them hard to ignore.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>",Second Russian blamed for Skripal poisoning named as GRU doctor: Bellingcat,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The second of two Russians who Britain blames for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal was named by investigative website Bellingcat on Monday as a military doctor for Russia's GRU intelligence service.
Bellingcat, which covers intelligence matters, named him as Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin, aged 39, who was charged by Britain last month under the name of Alexander Petrov.
Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper also named Mishkin in a separate report published on Monday.
British prosecutors charged Petrov and another man they named as Ruslan Boshirov in absentia with attempted murder for the Novichok nerve agent attack on Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in March, but said they believed the suspects had used aliases to enter Britain.
Bellingcat last month identified Boshirov as a colonel in the GRU whose real name was Anatoliy Chepiga.
British police said they would not comment on speculation about the real identities of the two men facing charges, in response to a query about the latest report.
Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a public bench in Salisbury, and the case prompted the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War. 
A woman later died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used to smuggle the nerve agent into Britain.
Mishkin was born in July 1979 in the village of Loyga in the Archangelsk district of northern Russia, and until September 2014 his registered home address in Moscow was the same as the headquarters of the GRU, Bellingcat said.
""Bellingcat's identification process included multiple open sources, testimony from people familiar with the person, as well as copies of personally identifying documents, including a scanned copy of his passport,"" the website said.
Mishkin's GRU rank was unknown, it added, but based on his 15-year service was likely to be lieutenant colonel or colonel.
He was recruited by GRU during his studies at one of Russia's military medical academies, and between 2011 and 2018 he traveled repeatedly under the identity of Alexander Petrov, including to Ukraine and Moldova's breakaway territory of Transdniestria.
Russia denies any involvement in the poisoning, and the two men have said publicly they were tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited Salisbury to see its cathedral.

Russia's embassy in London did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.

HASANKEYF, Turkey (Reuters) - Hundreds of people displaced by a huge dam in southeast Turkey fear they could go homeless because resettlement laws prevent them from moving into a new government-built town above the rising Tigris River waters.
The Ilisu dam, which Turkey planned to fill this year, will generate 1,200 megawatts of electricity but has been criticized for water shortages it will create downstream in Iraq and for the tens of thousands of people it will displace in Turkey.
For hundreds of residents of the 12,000-year-old town of Hasankeyf and its neighboring village of Kesmekopru, both of which will be submerged, housing laws may also block them from finding new homes on the nearby mountainside.
Those regulations bar unmarried adults and people with addresses registered elsewhere from claiming home ownership in the new site, residents and town officials told Reuters.
Two Hasankeyf residents affected by the laws, siblings Fatime and Hizrullah Salkan, have filed legal petitions to find new homes when the waters rise and they are forced from their houses - built next door to each other by their parents.
Fatime, 44, is not married and her 47-year-old brother, a father of four, switched his address to a neighboring province while seeking work there five years ago, meaning they both fail to meet requirements for being rehoused. 
""They told us everything would be perfect - that everyone would own a house, there wouldn’t be any problems,"" Hizrullah said. ""But now we are doomed to be migrants.""
Also uprooted by the dam waters will be Hasankeyf's ancient tombs, minarets and monuments, which are being transferred to a tourist park.
Ahmet Akdeniz, president of the local cultural association, said he supports the dam and the new settlement site, and expects Hasankeyf's antiquities to be more easily accessible at their new location. But the home ownership restrictions, he said, are a disaster for hundreds of residents in Hasankeyf.
""Whoever wrote these laws is brainless,"" he said. ""They'll have to change them. There won't be anywhere for these people to go.""
Asked whether steps were being taken to address the needs of people deemed ineligible for new housing, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, which is overseeing the Ilisu Dam project, said local authorities had planned to make some homes available for sale but ""there is no demand"".
Other state bodies, including the Environment and Urbanisation Ministry, which issued the home-ownership laws, declined or did not respond to requests for comment. 
""CITY"" LIFE
Turkey briefly started filling the dam in June, but officials said it halted temporarily a week later after complaints from Iraq about reduced water flows in summer.
Like Hasankeyf, which it faces across the Tigris River, the village of Kesmekopru will be forced to evacuate once the dam’s reservoir fills properly. 
But none of Kesmekopru’s more than 600 residents will be allowed to own homes in the new settlement site because it is not considered a neighborhood of Hasankeyf, according to village headman Metin Dezen.
When Dezen asked provincial authorities why his villagers could not move to the new site, they told him: ""'You're village people, we can't give you a city,'"" he told Reuters.
Asked about Dezen’s claim, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said residents of Kesmekopru had been paid for the loss of their land and had not applied for new housing from the government.
For the approximately 20 families who have already moved from Hasankeyf to the new homes, however, their present living conditions do not resemble a city.
Although authorities have said construction is 94 percent complete, the streets are still full of construction vehicles, the tap water is brownish, the air swirls with dust, and the area is barren. A clump of pine trees planted on a ridge above the site are brown and dead. 
Mazlum Cetin, 27, works as a local tour guide in Hasankeyf but moved to the new settlement site in April. He fears the local economy will worsen after the dam because tourists will not be as eager to see Hasankeyf's artifacts away from their historical location.
""In New Hasankeyf, people will just come and swipe their [museum entry cards] and see everything and leave,” he said.
Mehmet Sait Tunc, 34, sells kebabs in the new settlement. As he stood at his food truck listing his grievances over the dirty water, dusty air and arid ground his seven-year-old son Adem ran past to add one more: the noise from the construction work. “The explosions are going off every day!”
Viewing a photograph taken the previous day of his old house in Hasankeyf, now taken over by local donkeys, Tunc shook his head sadly, comparing the greenery around his old house to the landscape he now inhabits. ""If the living conditions here don’t improve, we’ll think about moving,"" he said.

DRUZHBA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian authorities suspect sabotage lay behind explosions that tore through an ammunition depot in the early hours of Tuesday, sending fireballs into the sky and causing more than 12,000 people to be evacuated.
No casualties were reported at the depot, located 176 km (about 110 miles) east of the capital, Kiev. Explosions were happening at a rate of two to three a second at one stage, according to the defense ministry.
Ukraine has in the past pointed the finger at Russia for such types of incidents as relations between the two countries have plunged following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist forces in the Donbass region. 
Without providing evidence, Ukraine's deputy prime minister linked the explosions to a decision pending in Istanbul this week to allow Ukraine to establish an independent national church, which Russia fiercely opposes. 
A Reuters witness later saw powerful explosions continuing at the depot. The blasts shattered windows in surrounding village houses while explosions could also be heard in a nearby wood where some ammunition appeared to have come down. 
The fact that explosions were set off at intervals in different parts of the depot pointed to sabotage, a defense ministry's spokesman said. 
""Two simultaneous explosions, and after five minutes two more explosions (in another part of the depot) suggest it was military sabotage,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Rodion Tymoshenko said at a press briefing. 
Authorities closed airspace in a 30 km radius and suspended road and rail transport. The emergency services reported that gas and electricity supplies to the area had been disrupted.
""The rumble started at 3 a.m. It rumbled three times, then I woke up and ran to my family and started waking them up,"" said Valentyna Petrenko, a resident in the nearby village of Druzhba. 
""We crept into the basement. We took documents, papers, everything we could, blankets, pillows and stayed in the basement.""
Hundreds of people and equipment were deployed to the site, a statement by the emergency services said, joined by Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman and the head of Ukraine's armed forces Viktor Muzhenko. President Petro Poroshenko had called for a report. 
Several large fires have hit ammunition and weapons depots in recent years, an additional drain on Ukraine's military. Fighting between Ukrainian troops and Moscow-backed separatist rebels has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.
Last year, massive explosions at a military depot in the Vynnytsya region, 270 km west of Kiev, forced the authorities to evacuate 24,000 people.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Former Guatemalan Vice President Roxana Baldetti was sentenced to 15-1/2 years in prison on Tuesday for fraud, influence peddling and illicit association related to a government contract to clean up a polluted lake, in the first of several cases she faces.
A panel of judges had charged Baldetti, 56, who has been in prison since 2015, for her role in the contract for chemicals to clean up Lake Amatitlan, around 16 miles (25 kms) south of Guatemala City.
The $17.8 million contract was awarded to M. Tarcic Engineering, an Israeli firm, but after $2 million was paid, investigators realized the money had been transferred to bank accounts of shell companies, and individuals who were later accused of fraud, prosecutors said. 
Investigators discovered that the chemicals were essentially water with salt, leading to the case being nicknamed, ""Magic Water.""
Baldetti ""issued instructions to place key people to execute the budget in favor of the criminal organization (and) facilitated the administrative and financial procedures for the company,"" said Pablo Xitumul, one of the three judges who sentenced the former vice president.
In 2015, both Baldetti and President Otto Perez resigned and were jailed over corruption scandals that gutted his government, sparked mass protests and plunged the country into a political crisis days before a presidential election.
Baldetti, who was vice president for three years, faces separate accusations of leading a network to defraud the state related to customs, alongside Perez, who is also awaiting trial.
She also faces corruption charges and an extradition request from the United States on drug trafficking charges.
Baldetti has denied the charges.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Espionage scandals show Russian army's growing clout,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's military spies are being mocked abroad as bunglers but the army's influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing and there is little likelihood it will halt its ""black operations"".
The GRU military intelligence agency is blamed by the West for several botched attacks this year, including attempting to kill former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury and trying to hack the global chemical weapons watchdog in the Netherlands. 
Russia's denials of wrongdoing have at times caused incredulous laughter in the West and some of the world's media have cast the GRU, which helped annex the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, as blundering amateurs.
But Western intelligence experts and Russian sources familiar with policy-making in the Kremlin say the West must stay on its guard.
""It’s easy to laugh at some of the GRU’s poor tradecraft and their ability but we should not underestimate them nor indeed the dangerous and reckless use of nerve agent on our streets,"" British Security Minister Ben Wallace told a security conference in Britain on Tuesday.
Intelligence experts say the GRU has stepped up its activities including black operations - covert missions that are not attributable to the organization carrying it out - as tensions mount between Russia and the West, which has imposed sanctions on Moscow over the annexation of Crimea.
""What Russia is doing is operating by wartime rules which means particularly that the GRU has been let off the leash,"" said Mark Galeotti, a fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. 
""As the East-West confrontation worsens that empowers these combative agencies and the GRU is being much more active,"" he said, adding that the GRU at times had freedom to choose how best to carry out orders from higher up. 
If the West hopes public shaming will prompt President Vladimir Putin to muzzle the GRU, whose official emblem features a bat hovering above the globe, it is likely to be disappointed.
A source close to the Defence Ministry, who declined to be named, said the GRU would continue its work. 
""We are under attack,"" said the source. ""We need to be robust.""
Asked on Monday if there would be a shake-up at the defense ministry, Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the low quality of the allegations leveled at GRU did not justify such changes.
""Russia believes there's no point in reducing the GRU's activities because that would be a unilateral concession that would not yield anything and probably be seen as a sign of weakness,"" said Tatyana Stanovaya, who is well connected to the political elite and runs political analysis firm R.Politik. 
""I think that malicious operations could even be conducted more often than in the past,"" she said.
The Kremlin is dismayed by fraying informal communications channels between Western and Russian intelligence agencies, she said, and sees the espionage world as a realm without rules.
Putin, a former intelligence officer himself, sounds defiant. He said last week espionage was one of the world's most important professions and dismissed Skripal as a traitor.
Despite Western media allegations about the GRU's alleged incompetence, there has been pride in some quarters in Moscow.
""If anyone had doubts that our employees work everywhere they shouldn't have any now,"" Konstantin Zatulin, a lawmaker, told state TV, while declining to confirm the allegations. 
""A FEW EMBARRASSING NEWS CYCLES""
The attacks on the Organisation for the Protection of Chemical Weapons in the Netherlands and on Skripal, in which the former spy and his daughter were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok but survived, are not the only signs the West sees of the GRU's increased activity.
The United States has indicted seven suspected spies and the West has united to accuse the GRU of a global hacking campaign.
Britain produced CCTV footage of the two suspects it says tried to kill Skripal and investigative website Bellingcat on Monday named the second suspect as a GRU military doctor after earlier naming the first man. 
The Netherlands has named the four suspected GRU agents it says tried to hack the OPCW. 
But there are no signs the Kremlin is more than momentarily embarrassed by the GRU's public woes, Galeotti said. 
""I suspect that the Russian calculation is that if it's just a few embarrassing news cycles, some tough words, and a bit of embarrassment we can just ride this out,"" he said.
From a Russian perspective, Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said the GRU's blunders were not a disaster.
""What was shown was nothing more than working hitches in extraordinarily risky but effective operations which achieved their main aims,"" Frolov wrote in Russia's Republic magazine. 
The GRU has become much more active since the annexation of Crime because of a broader foreign policy. 
Before 2014, Moscow mainly confined itself to the former Soviet Union. But since then, Russia has become more active in the Middle East and Africa, while the United States and European countries have accused Moscow of interference in their affairs.
There are other signs of the army's rising influence besides the uptick in the GRU's activity. 
Particularly vocal on Syria, where Russia helped turn the tide of war in President Bashar al-Assad's favor, the Defence Ministry was out of the traps even before the Kremlin when Syrian forces accidentally shot down a Russian military plane last month, accusing a ""hostile"" Israel of causing the incident.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was also one of only two companions Putin took with him when he went hiking this summer, the other being the head of the FSB security service. Shoigu, 63, is not involved in party politics but opinion polls often put him among the most popular presidential possibles.
In another sign of the military's and his own growing influence, Shoigu has ordered a giant cathedral dedicated to the armed forces to be erected in Moscow and only last week spoke of the need to create a second capital city in Siberia.

""The army's influence will rise,"" said R.Politik's Stanovaya. ""Putin believes Russia is in a state of war.""

Hungary has already announced it will not sign up to the Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was approved in July by all 193 U.N. member nations except the United States, which pulled out last year. 
The pact, due to be adopted in December, addresses issues including why people migrate, how to protect them and how to integrate them into new countries.
Poland, along with Hungary and Czech Republic, has taken a tough stand against resettling migrants, putting it at odds with the European Union, but striking a chord with voters by arguing that irregular immigration threatens European stability. 
""I will recommend to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to opt out from the Global Compact (GCM) deal, which is due to be signed in December in Marrakech,"" Joachim Brudzinski was quoted by the Interior Ministry Twitter feed as saying.
""In our opinion the draft of the agreement does not guarantee Poland's safety. It may also encourage illegal immigration.""
The government's press office had no immediate comment on the recommendation.
Brudzinski was speaking at the G6 summit in Lyon, France, where he met his Italian counterpart Matteo Salvini, among others, the ministry tweeted. Brudzinski retweeted the Tweet.
Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party built its 2015 parliamentary election landslide victory in part on kindling the fear of migrants. That year, Europe saw the biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two.

Nonetheless, Poland, with a population of 38-million people and record low unemployment of 5.8 percent, has taken in a large influx of foreign workers, mainly from Ukraine, but also from Belarus and parts of Asia, as the fast developing economy struggles with a lack of workers.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Work stalls in many small factories in Indian PM's home state after attacks on migrants,"By Amit Dave and Abhirup Roy
AHMEDABAD/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Mukesh Patel's factory making decorative lights sits eerily silent during what should be one of its busiest times of the year. 
Work at the plant in Ahmedabad, the largest city in India's western state of Gujarat, has come to a standstill just ahead of India's crucial festival shopping season as dozens of his workers have fled the state.
Their departure in recent days followed news of violence in Gujarat against migrant workers from the central states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. 
Tens of thousands of them have fled in recent days, and many of the small factories and businesses they work in have come to a standstill in one of India's most industrialized of its 29 states. No one knows if or when the workers will come back.
""There aren't enough people, so how will we continue?,"" said Patel, sitting in the reception area of his office opposite his factory building. 
In addition to businesses, many of Ahmedabad's street food stalls are closed because they were mostly run by people from the three states to the east of Gujarat. 
The exodus began after the rape of a 14-month-old girl last month, allegedly by a man from the state of Bihar, sparked anger among locals, who threatened, and in some cases physically attacked, migrant workers from the three states.
No one was killed and injuries were relatively minor, but the threats caused panic.
Local media reports said a speech by an opposition party politician, who vowed to take revenge for the crime if police did not act, may have stoked some of the violence. 
Police arrested the man accused of the rape, but messages and videos of the threats spread quickly both via vigilante mobs and social media. Authorities have tried to defuse the crisis - police say nearly 500 people have so far been arrested and charged with rioting, assault and cyber crime, in relation to more than 50 reported offences. 
But the workers are fleeing back to their villages despite assurances from business owners and protection from the police.
""For more than a week, migrant workers have been leaving the state in jam-packed trains and vans everyday,"" said Shyam Singh Thakur, who heads an association representing migrants.
He estimated more than 70,000 workers had fled Gujarat since the beginning of the month but said it was difficult to provide any concrete data.
On Monday, an express train bound for Uttar Pradesh from Ahmedabad was full of people going back home because of the violence and the threats.
Among them was Trilokinath Chauhan, a welder, headed back to his village in the Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh, after working for nearly five years in Gujarat. 
He said a mob of about one hundred people threatened him and his friends on Saturday night, asking them to take ""the first train out of Gujarat or face the consequences.""
Chauhan and two of his friends decided to leave. 
""We're all very sacred,"" he told Reuters on Monday morning, sitting in a crowded compartment in the Ahmedabad-Lucknow Express. 
""I don't know what to do now. I will have to look for a job in the village or work in the fields,"" he said as the train started pulling out of the station. 
ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR
The exodus could badly hurt small- and medium-sized businesses in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he ran for 13 years and pitched as a model for industrialization and growth. 
The state continues to be governed by his Bharatiya Janata Party.
In the last two years, many of these businesses had already been stung by a slowdown due to two of the Modi government's biggest reforms - demonetization and the introduction of a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST). [nL3N1W4291]
""This will delay production and businesses will miss delivery deadlines,"" said Atulbhai Kapasi, president of the Gujarat State Small Industries Federation, adding that sectors such as textiles, engineering, chemicals and pharmaceuticals will suffer the most. ""This will hurt their profits.""
Some business owners have hired personal security guards for the workers while others have made arrangements for them to stay in their factories, he said. 
Some people have also set up relief camps on the outskirts of Ahmedabad to provide food and shelter to migrants and plead with them to stay.
""A lot of effort is being made to persuade people not to leave,"" said Sanjay Srivastava, an additional director general of police in the state. 
The timing is especially bad as demand for finished goods peaks around October and early November for the major Hindu festivals of Dussehra and Diwali.
Festive shopping is a big boost for Indian businesses as the period is considered auspicious for buying goods like jewelry, clothes, automobiles and houses. 
Economists estimate that sales of goods and clothing in October typically make up 35-50 percent of annual sales. 
Many businesses also take advance orders to fulfill the high demand and any disruption in production can lead to significant losses. 
""The biggest impact will be on the business-friendly image of Gujarat. That will take a beating,"" said Kapasi. ""At the end of the day, it's our loss.""

""I see plots where the only limit to the ambition of our adversaries is their imagination,"" Ben Wallace told a security conference in London.
""As I speak, terrorists continue to explore new ways to kill us on our streets: chemical and biological weapons are marching in closer. They have developed and worked on a better arsenal. We have to be prepared for the day that might come to our streets here.""
Last year, Britain suffered five attacks that the authorities blamed on terrorism that killed 36 people, four of which were carried out by Islamist militants. 
In addition, police say another 17 plots were foiled and the national threat level remains at ""severe"", meaning an attack is considered highly likely.
""These things have been used on the battlefield and what's used on the battlefield will eventually be adapted to be used on domestic soil,"" Neil Basu, the UK police lead for counter-terrorism, said when asked about Wallace's comments on chemical and biological weapons. 
""So I think he is as concerned as I am that these are the kind of threats we've got to take very seriously and we have got to make sure we have the right preparations to counter that threat.""
British security services, like those across Europe, have been worried about those who left the UK to fight on behalf of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, returning home and bringing back the knowledge they learned on the battlefields there.
Wallace said about 900 Britons had gone to fight in Syria and Iraq and just under half had returned while more than 150 had been killed.
Basu also repeated a warning from police that failure to strike a deal with the European Union that allowed Britain to continue sharing and receiving intelligence with their European colleagues would harm the fight against terrorism.
""UK policing currently utilises 32 European law enforcement and national security measures on a daily basis,"" he said.
""The loss of one or more of these measure, particularly covering areas such as intelligence-sharing, surveillance, pursuit and extradition, would have a significant operational implication for us.""

The election candidate, Saleh Mohammad Achekzai, was killed in the blast at an election rally in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand, Omar Zwak, the provincial governor's spokesman confirmed. At least 11 people were wounded.
No group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack in the province bordering Pakistan that has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the Taliban insurgency.
Taliban militants have ramped up attacks in strategic provinces ahead of the Oct. 20 election, and ordered Afghans on Monday to boycott voting, while demanding a complete withdrawal of foreign forces as the only way to end the 17-year-old war.
Hundreds of people have been killed or hurt in violence linked to the election, with two major attacks in the capital, Kabul, in April and in Khost province in May, but security officials say attacks could pick up as polling day nears.
Violence has surged in the run-up to the vote, which militants have vowed to disrupt. At least 13 people were killed and more than 30 injured in a suicide attack at an election rally in the eastern province of Nangarhar this month.
Almost 9 million voters and 2,500 candidates competing for places in the 249-seat lower house have been registered and campaigning officially began late last month.

GAZA (Reuters) - A truck brought fuel across Israel's border into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what sources said was a Qatari- and U.N.-backed drive to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence.
The shipment was a potential slap to the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which opposed the foreign relief plan. Gaza is controlled by Abbas's rival, the Islamist Hamas group and the Palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control.
Under a blockade by Israel and Egypt designed to isolate Hamas, Gaza has plunged into poverty. Over the last half year it has seen weekly, often violent Palestinian border protests and lethal counter-fire by the Israeli military.
The truck that entered Gaza brought the first delivery out of a $60 million fuel donation by Qatar meant to provide the power plant with enough fuel to operate for six months, local sources said. 
The cash-starved plant has been providing Gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily.
A spokesman for the Abbas-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery. 
""Any international financial aid to the Gaza Strip should be through, or with the coordination of, the Palestinian government,"" he said, in order ""to preserve Palestinian unity"" and to stop any plans to separate Gaza from the West Bank.
A Qatari official, speaking to Reuters on Sunday, said Doha planned to help with Gaza's power crisis ""at the request of donor states in the United Nations, to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster"".
U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Israel's energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Reuters on Monday that Qatar ""was trying to help"" prevent a Gaza flare-up.
Steinitz accused Abbas, who has restricted PA funding for Gaza, of ""seeking to make gains on two counts: by encouraging a conflict in which Israel will clobber Hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber Israel on the world stage"".
Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008.
Months of Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Abbas have been held up by power-sharing disputes.
""Abbas believes that if he keeps the Gaza closure tight, it will make Hamas accept his reconciliation plan, which would give the Abbas government full control - or the people in Gaza will launch a revolution against Hamas,"" said Palestinian political analyst Hani al-Masri.
""This is making it easy for others to bypass the Palestinian Authority ... They are trying to give them (Gazans) a sedative, sometimes through Egypt, and this time through Israel."" 
Palestinians launched the border protests on March 30 to demand an easing of the Gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel's founding in 1948.

Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since. Israel has lost a soldier to a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in cross-border incendiary attacks.

The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement rules Italy together with the far-right League. In the European Parliament it sits in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) euroskeptic bloc with Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party (UKIP).
Its future grouping in the EU assembly remains unclear. The party has tried to join the pro-European liberal group but was rejected.
""There is no doubt that the Movement will never sit together with (Marine) Le Pen,"" 5-Star's Roberto Fico told reporters in Brussels after meeting leaders of political groups in the EU parliament.
Le Pen's far-right National Rally sits in the EU chamber together with the League, led by Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, in their Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) grouping.
Fico, the speaker of Italy's Chamber of Deputies, said he wanted to meet all political groups before deciding alliances.
His remarks echoed comments earlier on Tuesday by 5-Star leader and Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio who said his party wanted an alternative group to the right and the left.

Far-right and euroskeptic groups are expected to gain ground in the European elections, according to an aggregation of national polls by Reuters, but their share of seats in the EU assembly is projected to remain well below 20 percent of the total 705 members.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Zulu king and Afrikaans nationalist group AfriForum are forming a partnership to develop the agriculture on vast swathes of land the monarch controls through a trust, AfriForum's CEO said on Tuesday.
The move comes as the ruling African National Congress (ANC) takes steps to change the constitution to expropriate land without compensation while also seeking to provide security of tenure to people living on royal tribal lands - policies opposed by AfriForum and the king.
""We are finalising a memorandum of understanding to make the agreement formal,"" AfriForum Chief Executive Kallie Kriel told Reuters. 
King Goodwill Zwelithini controls 2.8 million hectares, a fragmented sub-tropical area the size of Belgium, under an entity called the Ingonyama Trust. 
""We have numerous members that have successful farms in the vicinity of the trust. The idea is to get a formula where there can be cooperation between our members and people living on the trust land to stimulate agricultural development,"" Kriel said.
Much of the farming in those areas is focused on sugar, cattle, game and high-value fruit such as avocados. AfriForum is generally seen as a right-wing, nationalist group that has lobbied for support for ""white rights"" in the United States.
The eNCA news channel's website on Tuesday quoted the king as saying: ""I'm asking AfriForum ... to come and help us. They are willing to work with me and my father’s people to uplift agriculture in our land.""
The monarch, who wields influence over millions of rural voters, reiterated his warnings to the ANC not to include his territory in its land reform drive. 
""Anyone who wants to be elected by us must come and kneel here and commit that I will never touch your land,"" he said.
The king said over the weekend he wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa to sign an agreement backing a pledge earlier this year not to expropriate trust land or change property relationships there.
Other traditional leaders have also told the ANC not to undermine their authority on the 13 percent of South African territory they rule. Much of it straddles rich deposits of platinum and other minerals.
Such leaders see themselves as the custodians of culture and traditions but critics say some have enriched themselves through their control of access to resources.

The ANC's main target is white-owned property. Most private South African land remains in white hands, making it a potent symbol of wider economic disparities.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue workers in Indonesia stepped up their search for victims of an earthquake and tsunami on Tuesday, hoping to find as many bodies as they can before this week's deadline for their work to halt, as the official death toll rose to 2,010.
The national disaster mitigation agency has called off the search from Thursday, citing concern about the spread of disease. Debris would be cleared and areas where bodies lie would eventually be turned into parks, sports venues and memorials.
Perhaps as many as 5,000 victims of the 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami on Sept. 28 have yet to be found, most of them entombed in flows of mud flows that surged from the ground when the quake agitated the soil into a liquid mire.
Most of the bodies have been found in the seaside city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta.
More than 10,000 rescue workers are scouring expanses of debris, especially in three areas obliterated by soil liquefaction in the south of the small city.
""We're not sure what will happen afterwards, so we're trying to work as fast as possible,"" said rescue worker Ahmad Amin, 29, referring to the deadline, as he took a break in the badly hit Balaroa neighborhood.
At least nine excavators were working through the rubble of Balaroa on Tuesday, picking their way through smashed buildings and pummeled vehicles. At least a dozen bodies were recovered, a Reuters photographer said.
""There are so many children still missing, we want to find them quickly,"" said Amin, who is from Balaroa and has relatives unaccounted for. ""It doesn't matter if it's my family or not, the important thing is that we find as many as we can.""
The state disaster mitigation agency said the search was being stepped up and focused more intensely on areas where many people are believed to be buried.
The decision to end the search has angered some relatives of the missing but taxi driver Rudy Rahman, 40, said he had to accept it.
""As long as they keep searching, I will be here every day looking for my son,"" said Rahman, who said he had lost three sons in the disaster. The bodies of two were found, the youngest is missing.
""This is the only thing I can do, otherwise I would go insane,"" he said, choking back tears. ""If they stop, what can I do? There are four meters of soil here. I couldn't do it on my own.""
'POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES' 
While Indonesian workers searched, the disaster agency ordered independent foreign aid workers to leave the quake zone.
Indonesia has traditionally been reluctant to be seen as relying on outside help to cope with disasters, and the government shunned foreign aid this year when earthquakes struck the island of Lombok.
But it has accepted help from abroad to cope with the Sulawesi disaster. 
The disaster agency, in a notice posted on Twitter, set the rules out for foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs), saying they were not allowed to ""go directly to the field"" and could only work with ""local partners"".
""Foreign citizens who are working with foreign NGOs are not allowed to conduct any activity on the sites,"" it said, adding that foreign NGOs with people deployed should withdraw them immediately.
A few foreign aid workers have been in the disaster zone, including a team from the group Pompiers Humanitaires Francais that searched for survivors, but they have spoken of difficulties in getting entry permits and authorization.
""This is the first time we encountered such difficulty in actually getting to do our work,"" team leader Arnaud Allibert told Reuters, adding they were leaving on Wednesday as their help was no longer needed.
Indonesian governments are wary of being too open to outside help because they could face criticism from political opponents and there is particular resistance to the presence of foreign military personnel, as it could be seen as an infringement of sovereignty.
""There are political sensitivities, especially with an election coming up, and sovereignty is another issue,"" said Keith Loveard, a senior analyst with advisory and risk firm Concord Consulting, referring to polls due next year.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami.
In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Foreign governments and groups played a big role in aid efforts in 2004.

Municipal lawmaker Fernando Alban, 56, was jailed last Friday for alleged involvement in the explosion of two drones during a military parade in August that was led by President Nicolas Maduro, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. 
In a Twitter post, Reverol said that while in the waiting room on the 10th floor of the headquarters of state intelligence agency SEBIN, Alban had jumped from the window to his death. 
That account differed from the one by Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab, who said in televised statements that Alban had asked to use a bathroom and jumped from there.
""We are concerned about news of his death, and also concerned about the fact that he wasn't presented to a judge within 48 hours which is the requirement under Venezuelan law,"" United Nations human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a Geneva news briefing.
""We do indeed call for a transparent, independent investigation to clarify the circumstances of his death. We understand there are conflicting reports on what exactly happened,"" she said.

The opposition First Justice party, for which Alban was a Caracas municipal counselor, said he was murdered. It said that his arrest was due to statements he made at recent U.N. meetings in New York City denouncing humans rights violations in Venezuela.

More than 10 million North Koreans, nearly 40 percent of the population, are undernourished and need humanitarian aid, the World Food Programme (WFP) said.
WFP, which provides fortified cereals and enriched biscuits to 650,000 women and children each month, may have to cut its nutrition and health programs again because it lacks funding, WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel said.
WFP and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) are among only a few aid agencies with access to North Korea, which suffered a famine in the mid-1990s that killed up to 3 million people.
""Despite some improvements this year, humanitarian needs across DPRK remain high with chronic food insecurity and malnutrition widespread,"" Verhoosel told a Geneva news briefing.
He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name for North Korea.
Some donors and companies, including shipping companies, have been reluctant to fund or to get involved in aid programs for North Korea, although humanitarian work is excluded from sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea for its nuclear and missile program, he said.
""We cannot wait for political or diplomatic progress to support a civilian population and to basically work on a humanitarian agenda,"" he said.
The United States, the WFP's largest donor overall, is not among current donors to its program in North Korea, which include France, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, and the Russian Federation, he said. 
The WFP, which appealed this year for $52 million for North Korea, needs $15.2 million to fund its programs over the next five months and avoid further cuts to its food assistance, he said.
Critical funding shortfalls meant this year the agency was forced to leave 190,000 children in kindergartens without nutritional support, he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - France has asked Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to remove photos of prisons from the internet, including one from which a notorious criminal known as ""the jailbreak king"" escaped by helicopter this year.
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said she had written to the internet search engine to request the removal of sensitive photos, but no action had been taken. 
""It's not normal that photos of security buildings such as our prisons are out there on the internet,"" Belloubet said in an interview on RTL radio station.
""I've written to Google asking for action to remove (photos of) these penitentiary sites but nothing has happened so far,"" she said. ""I may have to ask to meet the people I wrote to.""
A Google spokesman said applications such as Google Maps and Google Earth drew on images from external sources.
""We have given our suppliers a list of sensitive locations and asked them to take the necessary steps as soon as possible to conform with the law,"" said the spokesman, adding that the list also included nuclear plants and army bases.
The minister was discussing the case of Redoine Faid, whose escape in July from the open courtyard of a jail complex south of Paris drew attention to the absence of anti-helicopter nets and the presence on the web of clear aerial photos of the site.
Faid was recaptured last week, three months after accomplices landed a hijacked helicopter in the yard of Reau prison, hacked their way into an adjacent visitor room with power-grinders to free him, and flew back out.
In a previous escape, Faid, a serial robber jailed for a botched cash-transport truck heist in which a policewoman died, took four wardens hostage and used dynamite to blast his way out of another prison.
Belloubet said Faid, who has declared himself to be on a hunger strike, was now in solitary confinement and banned from receiving visits at his new prison in northern France, of which photos are also readily accessible on the web.
Faid became a notorious semi-celebrity in France after writing a book about his colourful life, describing how he was born into crime in high-rise housing estates of the kind that sprang up around Paris in the 1960s and 1970s.

He has said his life of crime was inspired by blockbuster films such as ""Scarface"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of Australians flickered torches on Tuesday at the sails of Sydney's Opera House, aiming the light rays to disrupt horse-racing advertisements projected on its facade, in a protest against the use of the building to promote gambling. 
A firestorm of criticism erupted after the government of the state of New South Wales overruled the management of the World Heritage listed building to allow the advertisements for the A$13-million ($9.2-million) Everest Cup.
Despite the protesters' efforts, televised pictures showed the projection, which began about 20 minutes earlier than planned, remained clearly visible and displayed horses' racing colors and barrier numbers. 
""We are known for the Sydney Opera House; to use it to advertise a horse race is just taking advantage of it,"" said Aideen Keane, 16, brandishing a torch as she sat on the Opera House steps, with her mother, Lesa Hogan.
""I'm not against horse racing, but I don't want the advertising here,"" added Hogan.
The government's decision came after a top radio ""shock jock"", Alan Jones, urged the Opera House's boss to resign or be sacked for objecting to the promotion. Many politician see Jones as having great influence over voters.
He later apologized, but the backlash had already hit, splashed across newspaper front pages and news bulletins for days, with about 290,000 people signing an online petition against the promotion.
The outrage had already prompted racing authorities to drop plans to hold the barrier draw publicly, so as to avoid ""security risks"", and betting was suspended from noon until the announcement of the draw result in the evening. 
Nevertheless, despite the torchlight, the results of the barrier draw were clearly visible, with short-priced runner and previous champion Redzel securing the prized inside barrier, closest to the rail, and bookmakers having resumed taking bets.
The Opera House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously directed Reuters to the state government.
The backlash was ""a little bit hysterical,"" New South Wales sports minister, Stuart Ayres, who is responsible for racing regulation, told reporters in Sydney. 
""This is a good opportunity for New South Wales and Sydney to come together,"" he added. 

The Opera House sails have been used in art installations and to advertise events such as the Rugby Union World Cup, but not for commercial advertising.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Criminal networks are using Iran as a transit point for illicit Somali charcoal exports that earn Islamist militants al Shabaab millions of dollars annually in tax, U.N. sanctions monitors said in a report seen by Reuters.
In the unpublished annual report to the U.N. Security Council, the monitors add that domestic revenue generation by al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab ""is more geographically diversified and systematic"" than that of Somalia's federal government.
The report says that since March the main destination for shipments - using fake country of origin certificates from Comoros, Ivory Coast and Ghana - has been ports in Iran, where the charcoal is packaged into white bags labeled ""Product of Iran"".
""The bags were then reloaded onto smaller, Iran-flagged dhows (boats), and exported to Port Al Hamriya, Dubai, UAE, using certificates of origin falsely indicating the 'country of manufacture' of the charcoal as Iran,"" the monitors wrote.
Iran became a transit point for the shipments -- which breach a U.N. ban on Somali charcoal exports -- after Oman tightened its customs procedures, said the report.
The monitors, who track compliance with U.N. sanctions on Somalia and Eritrea, said Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not ""substantively engage"" when the monitors raised concerns about the transshipment of Somali charcoal.
The report estimated the wholesale value of illicit Somali charcoal to be $150 million a year in the UAE, where it is widely used for cooking and smoking shisha water pipes, also known as hookah or nargile. They also estimated that about three million bags of charcoal were exported from Somalia in the past year.
""The charcoal trade continues to be a significant source of revenue for al Shabaab, generating at least $7.5 million from checkpoint taxation,"" they wrote.
UAE Ambassador to the U.N. Lana Nusseibeh said she could not comment because the report had not yet been published. 
""That being said, the UAE is fully aware of all Security Council resolutions and is in full compliance with the sanctions imposed,"" she told Reuters. ""We also reaffirm our continued cooperation with the Monitoring Group throughout its mandate.""
The Iranian mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The U.N. Security Council banned charcoal exports from Somalia in 2012 in a bid to cut off funds for al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-affiliated group trying to topple Somalia's Western-backed central government and impose its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
The Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Somalia in 1992 to cut a flow of arms to feuding warlords, who ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and plunged the country into war. 
""SOPHISTICATED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM""
In addition to earnings from charcoal, al Shabaab is making millions of dollars annually via tolls on vehicles in areas where they man checkpoints and through taxes on businesses, agriculture and livestock. 
All this ""generates more than enough revenue to sustain its insurgency"", the monitors wrote. 
Despite controlling far less territory than it did at the height of a decade-long insurgency, ""the group's ""ability to carry out complex asymmetric attacks in Somalia remains undiminished"", the monitors wrote.
Al Shabaab's most lucrative checkpoint is about 160 km (100 miles) north-west of the capital Mogidishu on the road to Baidoa, the monitors said, citing an al Shabaab defector who reported that the location earns the group approximately $30,000 per day -- $10 million a year. 
""Employing mafia-style tactics, the group is able to levy taxation via a network of hinterland checkpoints, with collection of taxes enforced through violence and intimidation,"" said the monitors, adding that truck drivers risked execution if they tried to avoid checkpoints.
Earlier this year the monitors obtained ledgers belonging to al Shabaab that were recovered after one of the group's senior accountants was killed in an attack by the Somali National Army and African Union peacekeepers. 
They wrote that the ledgers detail al Shabaab's revenue and expenses in one region, Hiran, in central Somalia, from October 2014 to March 2018 and ""display a sophisticated accounting system"" in which the militants transfer funds using the mobile money system operated by mobile network Hormuud Telecom.
The monitors said that the militants' tax generation system ""is more geographically diversified and systematic"" than that of the federal government, and that due to the militants' provision of receipts, the taxation system is ""accountable and predictable"", in contrast to the network of checkpoints manned by the government's armed forces in some parts of the country. 
Under an International Monetary Fund program, the government in Mogadishu is implementing public finance reforms, and domestic revenues have quadrupled since 2012 to the end of 2017 according to the finance ministry. 
Reuters however reported last year that the United States had decided to suspend food and fuel aid to most of Somalia's armed forces over corruption concerns.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. adviser on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad held talks in Islamabad on Tuesday with Pakistan's foreign secretary, the foreign office said, days after visiting Kabul to try to restart talks with the Taliban for an end to the 17-year Afghan war. 
The appointment last month of Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, highlighted the U.S. administration's fresh efforts to convince Taliban leaders to participate in the Afghan peace process, despite a surge in the group's attacks.
Khalilzad met President Ashraf Ghani in the Afghan capital on Sunday to discuss possible peace talks with the Taliban, who have repeatedly rejected negotiation offers and called for a boycott of an Afghan general election set for October 20.
Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua received Khalilzad and the two led ""delegation-level talks"", with security, defense, and diplomatic officials from both countries attending, foreign office spokesman Mohammad Faisal said on social network Twitter. 
Pakistan's cooperation in the peace process is believed to be key to its success. The country's powerful military is believed to have kept close ties to the Afghan Taliban since using it to blunt Indian influence in the region in the 1990s.
U.S. officials have accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban militants in its border regions with Afghanistan and using them as an arm of its foreign policy. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies.
Khalilzad is set to travel to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar after leaving Islamabad as part of a 10-day trip in a bid to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table. 

The Afghan-born former ambassador's knowledge of the country's main languages, culture and politics could help him engage with all stakeholders in the peace process, besides his experience advising or working for four U.S. administrations.

Sunday's referendum to change Romania's constitution to prevent same sex couples from securing the right to marry was seen as a key popularity test for the ruling Social Democrats (PSD), whose attempts to weaken anti-corruption legislation have been condemned by the European Commission.
But the referendum backfired as turnout was only 21 percent, below the minimum 30 percent required for validity. Analysts said voters had viewed the referendum as a ruse by the PSD, which supported the change, to divert attention from more pressing concerns.
""This draft bill is finalised and...my fellow lawmakers will submit it in parliament next week,"" European Affairs Minister Victor Negrescu told the state news agency Agerpres.
The religiously conservative European Union state currently bans both marriage and civil unions for same-sex couples and does not recognize those performed abroad. 
Earlier this year, Romania was forced by a European Court of Justice ruling to grant residency rights to gay spouses married in other EU states.
Previous attempts to legalize civil unions did not make it out of parliament's legal commissions.
Dozens of human rights groups had said a successful referendum would embolden further attempts to chip away at the rights of minority groups and push Romania onto a populist, authoritarian track.

Romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001, decades later than neighboring countries. It ranks 25th out of 28 EU states based on legislation, hate speech and discrimination toward LGBT people, according to an annual study by ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organization advocating equality.

BELFAST/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Brexit deal is ""eminently possible"" within weeks but there can be no regulatory barriers within the United Kingdom, the head of the Northern Irish party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday.
Less than six months before the UK's exit from the European Union, there is little clarity about how the world's fifth largest economy and its preeminent international financial center will trade with the EU after Brexit.
Talks are snagged on how to avoid checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the sides fail to clinch a post-Brexit free trade deal.
May and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which supports her minority government, have opposed EU proposals for a backstop that would keep Northern Ireland - but not mainland Britain - de facto inside the EU economic space.
Ahead of a meeting with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, DUP leader Arlene Foster stuck to her rejection of any new regulatory or customs barriers inside the United Kingdom - but said that, with political will, a deal was possible.
""I want to see a deal that works for everyone and I think that is eminently possible if the political will is there to make it happen,"" Foster told BBC Radio Ulster. ""I very much hope that there is a deal in a number of weeks."" 
The EU's Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with Britain is ""very close"", diplomatic sources told Reuters last week, indicating a compromise on the future Irish border was in play.
A flurry of Brexit activity is expected over coming days.
Barnier will update the Commission on Wednesday and then EU ambassadors meet on Friday in Luxembourg. EU leaders' negotiators meet in Brussels on Monday.
But even if May clinches a deal, there is uncertainty on whether she could sell it at home, where she will need approval from the British parliament.
Lawmaker Steve Baker said at least 40 lawmakers in her Conservative Party were willing to vote down her possible Brexit deal if it left the UK 'half in and half out' of the EU.
BLIND BREXIT?
If lawmakers reject a deal, May could fall and Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement, a move investors and company chiefs say would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade.
The United Kingdom would move from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states.
""Colleagues will not tolerate a half-in, half-out Brexit,"" said Baker, who served as a junior Brexit minister in May's government until he resigned in protest at her proposals.
If 40 of her lawmakers voted against a possible deal, the fate of the government and exit process would depend on the opposition Labour Party, which has indicated it will vote against almost any deal May might secure.
Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.
A 'hard' Brexit would result in extra tariffs of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for German companies per year, a German institute said on Tuesday, adding that German exports to Britain could drop by up to 57 percent.
Under May's proposals, Britain will seek a free trade area for goods with the EU, largely by accepting a ""common rulebook"" for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide authorizations for goods.

Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept control over swathes of the British economy and thus run counter to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs Union and the Single Market.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Bangladesh court to rule on 2004 blasts targeting PM Hasina,"DHAKA (Reuters) - A Bangladesh court will rule on Wednesday in a case in which most of the leaders of the main opposition party are accused of plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a public rally 14 years ago, when she herself was in opposition.
Among those facing charges is Tarique Rahman who is leading the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) from London while his mother and the former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, is jailed in separate graft cases.
The court ruling comes just months ahead of a national election in which Hasina will be seeking a third consecutive term in office while the opposition remains in disarray. 
The case relates to an attack on a public rally organized by Hasina's Awami League in the capital, Dhaka, in August 2004 while she was in opposition. Minutes into her speech, assailants threw grenades into the rally, killing 24 and wounding more than 500, most of them party workers.
Hasina escaped injuries. Her party blamed the BNP for mounting the attack that occurred while her bitter foe Khaleda was in power.
""The target was Sheikh Hasina and all the leaders of her party,"" said Motahar Hossain, a deputy attorney general. Hossain, who led the prosecution case, said he would ask for the death penalty if a guilty verdict is handed down.
The case is likely to further deepen the divisions in country's volatile politics. Hasina is already facing criticism of crushing dissent and of putting rivals behind bars to strengthen her re-election bid. 
""The government is trying to implicate top leaders of the opposition,"" said Khandker Mahbub Hossain, a senior leader of the BNP. ""This is nothing but political revenge.""
Khaleda was jailed in February for five years on corruption charges that she alleged were part of a plot to hamper her political career. 
Her son, Tarique Rahman, was also convicted and sentenced to a 10-year prison term, though he now lives in exile in London.
Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said police will be on high alert for Wednesday's ruling. 

""We will deal with anyone disturbing public disorder with an iron hand.""

""Nine persons have lost their lives and 14 are undergoing medical treatment,"" state-run SAIL, one of India's biggest steel producers, said in a statement.
The fire, which occurred during a scheduled maintenance job at its Bhilai plant, has now been controlled, SAIL said. There was no immediate comment from the company on whether production was affected.
""It is very difficult to say how many more have died, as some bodies are charred,"" a police official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media, told Reuters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has invited Pope Francis to visit Pyongyang in a gesture designed to highlight peace efforts on the Korean peninsula, South Korea's presidential office said on Tuesday.
North Korea and the Vatican have no formal diplomatic relations. South Korean President Moon Jae-in will deliver Kim's invitation when he meets Francis next week during a trip to Europe, Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said.
""President Moon will visit the Vatican on Oct. 17 and 18 to reaffirm its blessing and support for peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,"" the spokesman told a news briefing.
""Especially when he meets with Pope Francis, he will convey Chairman Kim's message that he will ardently welcome him if he visits Pyongyang.""
Kim told Moon of his wish to meet the pope during last month's summit of the two leaders, the spokesman added, without elaborating on the timing. The pope has said he wants to visit Japan next year.
The Vatican said in a statement that the pope will receive Moon at noon (1000 GMT) on Oct. 17.
The day before, in St. Peter's Basilica, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state and the pope's second-in-command, will say a ""Mass for Peace"" on the Korean peninsula. Moon will attend the Mass, the Vatican said. 
North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as long as it does not undermine the state, but beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship, no open religious activity is allowed.
The invitation to the pope is the first by a North Korean leader since 2000. Although that meeting, proposed by Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, never materialized, the plan for Francis to visit is the North's latest diplomatic initiative this year.
Kim held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, and pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
While Kim's actions since have fallen short of Washington's demands, the Trump administration is preparing for a second summit.
Before they turned the page on decades of public acrimony, the leaders regularly traded threats and insults as North Korea pushed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States. 
The two Koreas held three summits this year, following years of confrontation marked by the North's nuclear and missile tests.

Moon's European tour, scheduled for Oct. 13 to 21, is primarily to attend the Asia–Europe Meeting in Belgium and includes stops in France, Italy and Denmark, his office said.

Police said the move was purely procedural, to keep the case active before a statute of limitations ban comes into force on the shooting's 25th anniversary on Oct. 11.
Iran's then Supreme Leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, in 1989 calling on Muslims to kill Rushdie and others associated with his book ""The Satanic Verses"" for its alleged blasphemy.
Publisher William Nygaard was severely wounded in the subsequent attack outside his home in Oslo.
Police said on Tuesday the suspects were foreign citizens who lived abroad but did not name them. ""We will do everything that's realistically possible to solve this case,"" police said in a statement.
Nygaard was not immediately available for comment. 
Under Norwegian law, people facing accusations have the right to a lawyer. Formal charges, if they come, are filed at a later stage. 
Khomeini's successor as Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in 2005 that the fatwa was still valid.

The wealthy Asian city state's High Court found Jolovan Wham, a vocal government critic, and John Tan, a member of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party, guilty of ""scandalizing the judiciary"" with the social media posts.
The posts of both Wham and Tan ""posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined,"" Judge Woo Bih Li said in his ruling.
Wham's post ""impugned the integrity and impartiality of Singapore’s judges, and thus the Singapore courts"" by implying judges were not independent and were partial to the government, he added.
Tan's post supporting the comments similarly impugned the court's integrity, the judge said. 
The convictions are the first under the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act that took effect a year ago, the Singapore Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) said, with sentencing set for Nov. 7. 
Convictions carry a fine of up to S$100,000 ($72,200) in addition to the maximum term of three years.
In a Facebook post after the ruling, Wham said he would await sentencing. Tan's party does not have an elected member in parliament, which is dominated by the ruling People's Action Party. 
Wham's lawyer, Eugene Thuraisingam, said he had argued his client was not contemptuous of the judiciary as he was ""merely comparing the relative independence"" of judges in different jurisdictions. The defendants have made no decision about an appeal, he added.
New York-based Human Rights Watch, which has urged Singapore to repeal laws and rules it says restrict free speech and public assembly, said the law fundamentally infringed basic rights.
""By using this law on scandalizing the courts against political activists, the Singapore government blatantly violated freedom of expression and confounded any real sense of justice,"" Phil Robertson, its deputy Asia director, said by email.

""The real tragedy in this whole situation is Singapore thinks it’s OK to employ such a rights-abusing law.""

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Syria offers amnesty to deserters and draft dodgers,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government has announced an amnesty for men who deserted the army or have avoided military service, giving them several months to report for duty without facing punishment, it said on Tuesday. 
The fear of conscription, and potential punishment for ducking it or for desertion, is frequently cited by aid groups as one of the main reasons refugees give for not wanting to return home. 
In a decree issued on his social media feeds, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the amnesty covered all punishments for desertion inside or outside Syria. 
Men inside Syria will have four months to take advantage of the amnesty while those outside will have six months.
Under Syrian military law, deserters can face years of prison if they leave their posts and do not report for service within a set amount of time. 
Syria's conflict began in 2011 after mass protests against Assad's rule, eventually leading to half a million deaths and drawing in world and regional powers. 
Many soldiers deserted, some to join the rebels and others to escape the fighting. More than half the pre-war population fled their homes. About 5 million went abroad and millions of others were displaced within Syria.
While the amnesty covers desertion, it does not cover fighting against the government or joining the rebels, who are regarded by the Syrian government as terrorists. 
In the past three years, Russian and Iranian military support has helped Assad regain control of numerous enclaves held by anti-Assad rebels or jihadist militants, ending fighting in many areas. 
After a Russian-Turkish deal to avert an assault on the last major opposition stronghold, in the northwest, it is unclear if there will be significant new military offensives soon. 
Lebanon says 50,000 Syrian refugees, among the more than a million it says are on its soil, have gone home voluntarily in assisted returns this year.

However, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says conditions have not yet been fulfilled for mass refugee returns. Speaking in Beirut in August, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said refugees were concerned about conscription, as well as other issues such as the lack of infrastructure.

""My estimate is that there are at least 40 colleagues who are not going to accept a 'half in, half out' Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union,"" lawmaker Steve Baker told BBC radio.
""Colleagues will not tolerate a half in, half out Brexit,"" said Baker, who served as a junior Brexit minister in May's government until he resigned in protest at her Brexit proposals.
If May secures a deal with the EU, she has to get the British parliament to approve it and would need the backing of about 320 lawmakers to get approval.

Without an approved deal, the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the European Union to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals.

""If the UK faces either possibility then we must in the end be willing to say it's a bad deal, and no deal is better than a bad deal,"" Baker said. ""We would need to be unafraid to go forward without an agreement.""

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","In Pakistan's once-vibrant media, some journalists view intimidation as the new normal","By Saad Sayeed
KARACHI (Reuters) - Pakistan's media was widely seen as among the region's most vibrant after military rule ended in 2008, but a dozen newspaper and TV journalists say the industry is now in disarray because of intimidation and army pressure.
In separate interviews with Reuters, they said a media crackdown that began in the run-up to the July election of new Prime Minister Imran Khan had morphed into widespread self-censorship by journalists fearful of repercussions if they criticize Khan, the military or courts.
A number of political commentators and opposition politicians say Khan is backed by the establishment, a term used in Pakistan to mean the military and intelligence top brass, along with some senior civil servants and judges. His main rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was at loggerheads with the military. 
Adding to the atmosphere of fear is a treason case filed against a prominent newspaper columnist, Cyril Almeida, following an interview he conducted with Sharif that mentioned the role of Pakistani militants in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. 
""There is a culture of silence. People are reluctant to talk about who is behind this,"" Islamabad bureau chief of independent Capital TV Murtaza Solangi told Reuters. 
""Self-censorship has hit new highs.""
The Pakistani military's public relations wing, the Inter Services Public Relations agency (ISPR), denied intimidating the media and said it doesn't pressure journalists to alter coverage.
""Our media is independent. ISPR has no role in controlling media expression,"" the military agency said in a written response to several questions from Reuters on what the journalists described as intimidation and harassment by security forces.
The agency declined to elaborate further.
Khan's office did not respond to a request for comment, but during the election campaign he dismissed reports of press intimidation. 
Pakistan's information minister Fawad Chaudhry told Reuters no media outlet has brought any complaints to his office.
""I think Pakistani media freedom can be compared to any first world country,"" Chaudhry said. 
""There is more of a talk than substance ... I have not received a single application or request or evidence of such censorship.""
A report released by the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) last month alleged that Pakistan's military was using fear and intimidation to stifle the media and undermine press freedom.
""The military has quietly, but effectively, set restrictions on reporting: from barring access to regions ... to encouraging self-censorship through direct and indirect methods of intimidation, including ... allegedly instigating violence against reporters,"" the CPJ said in the report, written after interviews with journalists, editors and media groups in five Pakistani cities in February this year.
The military has not responded to requests for comment on the CPJ report.
INFLUENCE JUDGMENT
""There are debates within organizations about what can lead the organization into a problem and these discussions essentially influence your editorial judgment,"" Talat Hussain, a journalist with Geo TV, Pakistan's leading television news channel, told Reuters.
""The problem can range from ... the channel getting shut down, to the business getting hurt by ad flow slowing down.""
The accusation of treason against the columnist Almeida is based on a May interview he conducted with Sharif in which the former prime minister indirectly suggested that Pakistan allowed militants based on its soil to carry out the 2008 militant attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people.
Pakistan has long denied any state involvement but the incident has been at the center of deteriorating ties with India. 
Sharif and Almeida both appeared before a court on Monday that will decide whether to formally charge them. Neither entered any plea and the case was adjourned until Oct. 22. 
A representative for Sharif did not respond to request for comment on this story. 
Almeida and senior editors at the Dawn newspaper he works for declined to be interviewed, saying they had been advised by lawyers to avoid comment on an ongoing case. 
DISAPPEARANCES
While journalists have rarely been jailed in Pakistan, several instances of abductions of reporters have created a culture of self-censorship, journalists interviewed said. 
""In general the media is being very careful in what not to report or discuss. If they do, they can face disruptions to circulation or to the placement of their channel on cable or at times a ... blackout,"" said Omar R Quraishi, former web editor at Samaa TV.
In June, Pakistani commentator, activist and frequent military critic Gul Bukhari was abducted by gunmen as she was on her way to a TV interview. A driver reported to the TV channel that men in military uniform stood by while plainclothes men took her away. 
Bukhari, a dual Pakistani-British citizen, was returned home the next day after a social media and international media outcry. She declined to go into details of her ordeal, but told Reuters her abduction could be ""viewed within that context"" of intimidation ahead of the general election.
The military denied playing any role in her abduction.
In January, Taha Siddiqui, a journalist known for critical reporting on the military, told reporters he narrowly avoided abduction after his taxi was stopped by armed men. He said he shouted for help when a military vehicle passed by but one of the armed men gestured to the vehicle to move on.
Siddiqui also filed a police complaint about the incident. 

The military denied it was involved.

The operation across eight provinces was carried out to prevent the activities of PKK members and the operation was ongoing, the ministry said in a statement.
The identity of those detained in Tuesday's operation was not immediately clear.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) had said on Sunday that 140 of its members had been detained over the previous three days, and that the detentions were politically motivated.
Turkey's government accuses the HDP of links to the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union. The HDP denies such links.
The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. Violence in the largely Kurdish southeast escalated after the collapse of a ceasefire in 2015.
Turkey has in recent months conducted regular strikes on PKK bases in northern Iraq, especially the insurgents' stronghold in the Qandil mountains, where Ankara has also threatened to carry out a ground offensive.

The public has been clamoring for information about Duterte's health after the 73-year-old missed two official events last week.
""He disclosed to us that the result of the test was negative, the one where they took samples from his intestines,"" Eduardo Ano told reporters in an event posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live by domestic news agencies. 
Ano said Duterte made the disclosure during a cabinet meeting on Monday night. The president made an unscheduled visit to a hospital when doctors asked him to repeat digestive tract procedures three weeks after similar tests.
Duterte's condition ""is not serious"" and will remain a confidential matter, his spokesman, Harry Roque, told a separate news briefing, declining either to confirm or deny the prior remarks of the acting interior minister.
""The president will abide by the constitution, but because it is not serious, he will treat his medical condition as confidential,"" he said. Roque declined to give details of the test results and Duterte's health.
""Let us wait for his disclosure. Anything that is confidential can be waived by the person alone.""
The Philippine constitution provides for the public to be told of the state of health of an incumbent president, if serious. If the leader dies in office, permanently disabled or removed through impeachment, the vice president succeeds to serve out the rest of a six-year, single term.
Vice President Leni Robredo, an opposition leader, was elected separately in 2016 and could fuel uncertainty in the succession process in a highly polarized political climate.
Duterte's health was a constant source of speculation after he disappeared from public view for a week last year but his aides dismissed rumors of his medical condition.

Over the weekend, Duterte was in Hong Kong with his partner and young daughter on an unannounced trip, with his special assistant, Bong Go, posting pictures of the family on social media.

RUSE, Bulgaria (Reuters) - The European Commission urged Bulgaria on Monday to conduct a rapid investigation into the killing of journalist Viktoria Marinova as hundreds of mourners held vigils in her hometown and cities throughout the Balkan country.
Prosecutors said the 30-year-old had been raped, beaten and suffocated. Marinova's body was found in a park near the Danube river in Ruse on Saturday.
""There is no democracy without a free press ... We expect a swift and thorough investigation to bring those responsible to justice,"" the European Commission, the European Union's executive said in a tweet.
Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other EU member.
While there has been no link established to her work so far, the killing has angered and upset many in a country where people are frustrated with rampant corruption and an inefficient and graft-prone judiciary, for which Sofia has been repeatedly rapped by the European Commission.
On her last aired TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced two journalists who were investigating alleged corruption involving EU funds. She said the regional current affairs show, ""Detector"", would do similar investigations.
Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said a bank transfer of 14 million euros ($16.06 million) had been frozen as part of a pre-trial investigation into issues raised by the investigative journalists on the show but declined to give further details. 
""There is no way that I can believe that this killing is random, after it happened just few days after the show that featured such massive misuse of funds. I am glad so many people are here,"" said Stoyka Panagonova, a mother of three, at the vigil in Ruse.
The European anti-fraud office OLAF declined to comment on the killing. But its press office said it was ""aware of allegations concerning possible misuse of EU funds in Bulgaria that have been brought to light by journalists in recent weeks"".
Marinova's appearance on ""Detector"" was the first time she had anchored the show on Ruse-based TV station TVN - a popular channel in northeastern Bulgaria. Previously, she was best known for presenting a regional lifestyle show and was not a household name nationally.
CANDLES LIT 
Interior Minister Mladen Marinov has said that there was no evidence to suggest a link to Marinova's work as journalist so far - something echoed by police and prosecutors.
""We are working on all possible motives and we do not exclude any,"" Marinov told reporters on Monday in Ruse, Bulgaria's main Danube river port city.
He said no match had been found so far for DNA collected from the crime scene, which was close to a psychiatric clinic. 
Police and prosecutors said they were working on three possible motives - whether Marinova was a victim of a random attack by a person with a mental disorder, a planned attack or whether the crime was linked to her personal life.
Marinova would be the third journalist murdered in the European Union over the past 12 months.
Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta's best-known investigative reporter, was killed when a bomb blew up her car in October last year and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February. 
Hundreds of people flocked to Ruse's main square to put flowers in front of a picture of Marinova, with some in the crowds urging the authorities not to play down the possibility her work was a reason for the killing.
""I strongly hope that the truth will soon be uncovered, her perpetrator or perpetrators found and justly punished,"" Teodora Shopova said after lighting a candle at the vigil. 
Vigils for Marinova, mother of a seven-year-old daughter, were also held in downtown Sofia as well as several other cities, with many demanding justice and an independent, even international, investigation.

The TVN channel expressed shock over the killing of its colleague and board member, but declined to comment further.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday that a jailed opposition lawmaker killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of the state intelligence agency headquarters (SEBIN) where he was being held, but his party said he was murdered by the government.
Municipal lawmaker Fernando Alban, 56, was jailed last Friday for alleged involvement in the explosion of two drones during a military parade in August that was led by President Nicolas Maduro, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said.
""At the moment he was going to be transported to court, while he was in the SEBIN waiting room, he jumped from the window of the building and fell, causing his death,"" Reverol wrote in a post on Twitter. 
That account differed from the one by Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab, who said in televised statements that Alban had asked to use a bathroom and jumped from there.
The opposition First Justice party, for which Alban was a Caracas municipal counselor, said he was murdered.
""With great pain and thirst for justice we tell the people of Venezuela ... that Councilman Fernando Alban was murdered at the hands of the regime of Nicolas Maduro,"" the party said.
First Justice's national coordinator, Julio Borges, said Alban's lifeless body was thrown from the SEBIN's headquarters on Caracas' Plaza Venezuela. He did not provide any evidence and did he say what led him to believe that Alban was killed.
The party said that Alban's arrest was owing to statements he made at recent United Nations meetings in New York City denouncing humans rights violations in Venezuela.
The government had previously given no reason for his arrest. On Monday, Reverol said Alban had also been investigated for ""destabilizing activities directed from abroad.""
The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker, called on Maduro to explain the reasons for Alban's death. Corker was in Caracas on Monday to meet with government officials and the opposition to assess Venezuela's economic crisis.
""This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened,"" Corker, a Republican, said on Twitter.
The United States imposed new sanctions on several of Maduro's top allies last week as President Donald Trump urged UN members to support a ""restoration of democracy"" in Venezuela.
Alban's assistant, Mileidy Blanco, said she had begged him to leave Venezuela with his family.
""And he didn't do it. He loved the country too much,"" she said in an interview outside the SEBIN's headquarters, known as ""The Tomb"" for its underground detention facility.
The opposition and rights groups have said that Maduro's administration is holding hundreds of political prisoners on trumped-up charges intended to stifle dissent. The United Nations has said detainees are often subjected to ill treatment, including some documented cases that amount to torture.
Authorities have arrested at least 30 people linked to the drone explosions on Aug. 2, which injured seven soldiers.
The government has denied that it is detaining people as political prisoners and has said that they were fairly jailed.
Alban's lawyer, Joel Garcia, told reporters that when he last saw Alban on Sunday ""he was not beaten, he was fine."" He said Alban told him that he had been interrogated but not tortured.
The Organization of American States (OAS) condemned Alban's death.

""Direct responsibility of a regime that tortures and murders. This criminal dictatorship must go now from Venezuela,"" OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro said on Twitter.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday hailed ""significant progress"" in talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the weekend and said the sides were ""pretty close"" to agreeing details for a second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump.
However, experts questioned what Pompeo had achieved on Sunday on his fourth visit to Pyongyang this year. They said the North Korean leader appeared simply to be repackaging and dragging out past pledges.
Pompeo told reporters Kim had said he was ready to allow international inspectors into North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and the Sohae missile engine test facility as soon as the two sides agreed on logistics.
However, Pompeo declined to say whether there had been any movement on North Korea allowing inspectors to visit its Yongbyon site, which produces fuel for nuclear weapons, as the United States has sought. North Korea has said it could permanently close Yongbyon if Washington took ""corresponding measures,"" of which there has so far been no sign.
In May, North Korea blew up tunnels at Punggye-ri and called this proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing, but a senior White House official accused Pyongyang at the time of breaking a promise to allow experts to witness dismantlement of the site, which meant there was no one there to verify what actually occurred.
Pompeo did not say when inspectors would be allowed to Punggye-ri, and the State Department did not respond when asked if they would be Americans or others from international nuclear bodies. 
""There's a lot of logistics that will be required to execute that,"" Pompeo told a news briefing in Seoul before leaving for Beijing, where the frosty tone of talks will raise worries about China's willingness help maintain a tough U.S.-led sanctions regime on North Korea.
""SELLING THE SAME HORSE TWICE""
Experts said the offer on inspections amounted to dressing up of an old, unfulfilled pledge as a new concession.
""The real takeaway from this Punggye-ri pledge is that Kim has mastered the art of milking a single cosmetic concession for months to burn clock,"" Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said on Twitter.
""We are still talking about Punggye-ri and Sohae 6 months after he pledged to dismantle them. Brilliantly selling the same horse twice.""
Even so, Pompeo said both sides were ""pretty close"" to agreement on the details of a second summit, which Kim proposed to U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter last month.
""Both the leaders believe there's real progress that can be made, substantive progress that can be made at the next summit,"" Pompeo said.
Trump and Kim held an historic first summit in Singapore on June 12 at which Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, his actions have fallen short of Washington's demands for a complete inventory of its weapons and facilities and irreversible steps to give up its arsenal.
Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea who accompanied Pompeo to Pyongyang, said he offered to meet his counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, ""as soon as possible"" and they were in discussion over time and place.
Pompeo told South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday his latest trip to Pyongyang was ""another step forward"" to denuclearization, but there were ""many steps along the way"".
INSPECTION
At last month's inter-Korean summit, the North expressed its willingness to close Yongbyon if Washington took corresponding action, which Moon said would include a declaration of an end to the 1950-53 Korean War.
Moon also said the North would ""permanently dismantle"" Sohae missile engine testing site in the presence of experts from ""concerned countries"". 
Pyongyang's failure to keep its pledge to allow international inspections at Punggye-ri in May fanned criticism that the move could easily be reversed.
In July, satellite imagery indicated it had begun dismantling the engine test site, but also without allowing outside verification. The 38 North project said last week that no dismantling activity had been spotted since Aug. 3. 
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Kim had invited inspectors to visit Punggye-ri to confirm it had been irreversibly dismantled.
Skeptics of Trump administration policy said it was difficult to see what Pompeo had achieved.
""Did Mike Pompeo go all the way to Pyongyang for party planning purposes?"" Daniel Russel, the chief U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last year, said on NBC. ""Is this just to set up a yet another summit without a clear understanding of what that’s going to generate?""
Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency was upbeat. It said on Monday Kim lauded his talks with Pompeo and ""explained in detail the proposals for solving the denuclearization issue.""
""Kim Jong Un expressed satisfaction over the productive and wonderful talks with Mike Pompeo at which mutual stands were fully understood and opinions exchanged,"" KCNA said.
Kim said the bilateral dialogue would continue to develop ""based on the deep confidence between the two leaders"", and expressed gratitude to Trump for making a sincere effort to implement the agreement made at their June summit, KCNA said. 
KCNA also said the two sides agreed to hold working negotiations for the second summit as early as possible.
But it made no mention of inspections.
North Korea had denounced Pompeo on his previous trip to Pyongyang in July for making ""gangster-like demands"". Pompeo did not meet Kim on that trip.
Moon also spoke positively of Pompeo's latest meeting with Kim. He said it set up conditions for another Trump-Kim summit and help denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Moon said Kim was expected to visit Russia soon and that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was also expected to travel to North Korea, but did not elaborate.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had invited Kim to visit, but the time and place had yet to be agreed.

(This version of the story corrects 4th paragraph to make clear that Washington has been seeking inspection of Yongbyon. North Korea has offered conditionally to close the site, but has not made a public comment on its inspection.)

Chandler was speaking at a news conference to report on the human cost of the relatively shallow, magnitude 5.9 quake, which hit the north of the impoverished country late on Saturday.
The tremor caused widespread panic in the north and was one of the strongest to shake Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck near the capital Port-au-Prince in 2010. That quake killed tens of thousands of people.

MADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Spain's most populous region, Andalusia, on Monday called a regional election for Dec. 2, in what will be the first electoral test for the country's ruling Socialist party since Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took power in June.
Andalusia is the first of a slew of local votes expected over the next year that will gauge the public mood after Sanchez came to office with the smallest parliamentary party minority since Spain returned to democracy.
The southern region, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union, is a stronghold of Sanchez's Socialist party. But the Andalusian branch of the party has been damaged by corruption scandals.
In addition, Andalusia is the destination for thousands of Africans who have entered Spain by sea since other European countries like Italy shut their ports to illegal migrants.
Sanchez's Socialists have taken a softer view on illegal migrants, allowing the disembarkation on Spanish shores of charity boats turned away from other European ports and restoring free healthcare for undocumented migrants.
Parties on the right such as the conservative People's Party (PP) and hard-right Vox have seized on these moves to step up their rhetoric against illegal migration.
However, polls show the Socialists riding high in the polls, with a recent well-regarded survey showing them easily winning an election if a vote were held.
But with the Socialists holding just 84 seats in the 350-seat parliament, Sanchez is scrambling to find support from other parties as he negotiates next year's budget.
The conservative PP and market-friendly Ciudadanos have vowed to reject the budget proposal, leaving Sanchez relying on hard-left Podemos and smaller, regional parties. Catalan regional parties have also threatened to withdraw their support.

Most Spanish regions and cities will hold local elections in May. European Parliament elections are expected for that month as well. A general election is due in 2020, but could come sooner if Sanchez's minority government fails to last the term.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 02:14PM ET</span>",Hurricane Michael expected to strengthen en route to Florida,"By Gina Cherelus
(Reuters) - Mandatory evacuation orders and school closures were issued on Monday in the Florida Panhandle as Hurricane Michael was expected to strengthen rapidly before slamming into the state on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. 
Michael was currently a Category 1 hurricane but could become a Category 3 storm by Tuesday on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds of at least 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour). The hurricane was predicted to dump 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) of rain with life-threatening flash flooding, according to forecasters. Storm surges of 2 to 12 feet (0.6 to 3.7 meters) were also expected.
Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in more than 20 counties along the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. Scott advised Gulf Coast residents to prepare for possible evacuation orders, and he put more than 5,000 National Guard soldiers on alert.
""We are running out of time. TODAY is the day to get a plan, because tomorrow could be too late. It is critical that you take care of yourself, your family, and your business as Hurricane Michael approaches FL,"" Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday. 
Michael battered parts of Mexico and Cuba with powerful winds and drenching rains on Sunday and into early Monday. The storm was about 145 miles (230 km) northeast of Cozumel, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), forecasters said. 
Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is also the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the Nov. 6 election, said on Sunday he was cancelling his campaign events and returning to Tallahassee, the state capital, to focus on storm preparations.
Florida State University said its campuses in Tallahassee and Panama City will be closed from Tuesday through Friday. All schools in Panama City and surrounding Bay County will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Leon County officials in Tallahassee were closing all schools from Tuesday through Friday. 
Mandatory evacuation orders were issued on Monday for residents in various areas in Gulf County, Florida, according to a statement from county emergency officials. Residents were given 24 hours to relocate to shelters. 
Jeff Hanson, the owner of Paisley Cafe in Tallahassee, said he was waiting until Wednesday morning to determine whether he would close the restaurant.
""There's a possibility we're going to be in business if we still have power,"" Hanson said by telephone. ""It depends on what the city says in terms of the people getting around. That's our biggest concern, if our staff is safe.""
After hitting Florida, the storm is forecast to move northeast on Wednesday and Thursday along the Atlantic Coast and batter the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month.
Oil companies, including  BP  (LON:BP) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), on Monday began evacuating personnel from Gulf of Mexico production platforms.
The Commodity Weather Group said Michael was not likely to cause much interruption to oil and gas production. 
The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>","To win second round, Brazil's leftist Haddad must remake his candidacy","By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's leftist presidential hopeful Fernando Haddad will have to pull off an extreme feat of political acrobatics if he wants to reverse a first-round beating at the hands of a far-right rival. 
To have a chance of winning the Oct. 28 runoff against Jair Bolsonaro, Haddad would need to move hard to the center, distance himself from his political mentor and denounce the corruption that flourished during his party's 2003-2016 run in government, political analysts said. 
A 55-year-old former mayor of Sao Paulo, Haddad became the Workers Party (PT) candidate just one month ago, after former president and PT founder Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was barred from running because of a corruption conviction.
Lula, a former union leader and longtime darling of the left, is serving 12 years in prison and faces five more trials.
From his jail cell, the charismatic Lula - who led the presidential race until he was jailed - handpicked Haddad as his replacement. Lula remains a hero for many poorer Brazilian for his efforts to reduce poverty during his two terms in office from 2003 to 2010, but he is also a divisive figure.
In campaigning so far, the PT's slogan has literally been ""Haddad is Lula. Lula is Haddad."" That message was necessary to maintain support from the party's left-wing factions, which have not fully embraced Haddad's centrist politics and academic background. 
But that pitch will not be enough to beat Bolsonaro, who holds a commanding lead and momentum. The former Army captain and veteran lawmaker beat recent opinion polls to take 46 percent of votes in Sunday's first-round election, compared to Haddad's 29 percent.
""Haddad has to pivot or perish,"" said Sergio Praça, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading university. ""He also must drop the talk that Lula is a political prisoner. He is not going to win with that line."" 
Bolsonaro's popularity has surged despite his praise for Brazil's 1964-1985 dictatorship - which has stirred fears he would militarize government in Latin America's largest nation.
Bolsonaro has also been charged with hate speech over his tirades against gays, black Brazilians and women. He has dismissed the federal charges as a political attack.
With their show of support on Sunday, Bolsonaro's voters declared that, like the Americans who back U.S. President Donald Trump, they do not mind his incendiary rhetoric. In fact, that is much of his appeal. 
They want him to bludgeon the political establishment, destroying a system that has refused to reform itself.
In a Sunday night speech, Haddad talked of unifying the country around democratic principles.
He thanked Lula for his support and said he would visit him in prison on Monday. He denounced Bolsonaro as representing a return to Brazil's dark authoritarian days. 
But not once did he utter the word ""corruption."" 
""Haddad has to tell the Brazilian people that the PT made serious errors, which he did not do in first-round campaigning,"" said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a Sao Paulo business school. ""He has no momentum and he will have to work tirelessly to explain why people should vote for him and put the PT back in power."" 
(graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ixe0NI)
VINDICTIVE VOTERS
Melo and Praça both joined a chorus of voices calling Bolsonaro a clear danger to Brazil's democracy, which emerged from a bloody military dictatorship three decades ago.
In moments of social, economic and political unrest, Brazilians have often looked for leadership from the military or a strongman backed by soldiers. 
Sunday's voting showed Bolsonaro - with his talk of an iron-fist on crime and corruption - fulfills that role well.
The election also saw a host of experienced politicians losing congressional and governors races, as Brazilians flayed the establishment after years of investigations that revealed stunning levels of graft. 
Many Bolsonaro voters hold their noses when it comes to his inflammatory rhetoric on social issues. They focus instead on his frank talk about rot in the political system and his argument that stopping crime requires killing more criminals.
But to win over more centrists and scoop up more votes on Oct. 28, Bolsonaro will also have to moderate his tone and better explain his policies — a task he has often left to advisors. 
In the past week, he tried to allay some fears about his offensive remarks.
""Bolsonaro is an enormous question mark. That alone is appealing to many — it's refreshing. But he will have to say repeatedly that he supports democracy,"" Melo said. 

""He has promised a total break with how politics has always been done. To do that, he has to show voters he will work with those who opposed him and that, if elected, he will govern for everyone.""

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Bill Cosby seeks new sexual assault trial, reduced prison sentence","(Reuters) - Citing new evidence, Bill Cosby has asked the Pennsylvania judge who sent him to prison for up to 10 years for sexual assault to grant him a new trial, or to reduce his sentence because of alleged procedural errors.
In court papers filed late on Friday, Cosby's lawyers said the judge abused his discretion by failing to adequately consider the 81-year-old entertainer's age and failing eyesight, and should have recused himself from sentencing. Cosby's attorneys have previously taken issue with the judge's wife being a psychiatrist who works with sexual assault victims.
""By undervaluing the mitigating impact of age and disability and overestimating any present danger to the community,"" Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill imposed a term whose harshness violated statutes and sentencing rules, they said in an 11-page motion.
Cosby is the first celebrity to be convicted of sexual abuse since the start of the #MeToo movement on social media, the national reckoning with misconduct that has brought down dozens of powerful men in entertainment, politics and other fields while demanding greater respect for and representation of women.
Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele intends to file a response, but otherwise has no comment, said his spokeswoman, Kate Delano. 
After a jury found Cosby guilty in April of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for the drugging and sexual assault of his one-time friend Andrea Constand, O'Neill on Sept. 25 branded him a ""predator"" and sentenced him to three to 10 years in prison.
The once-beloved comedian, known as ""America's Dad"" in the 1980s and 1990s during the run of his hit television sitcom, was marched out of court in shackles and began serving his sentence immediately.
In seeking a new trial, attorneys Peter Goldberger and Joseph Green said they had found evidence which shows that a recording of a phone call with Cosby made by Constand's mother, Gianna, and played at the trial was not authentic.
During the recorded call, Cosby suggested that he would be willing to pay for Constand to attend graduate school.
The lawyers also resurrected their claim that Cosby was not at his home when Constand said he assaulted her and that if there was an incident, it would have occurred outside of the state's 12-year statute of limitations.

Even if the judge rejects their request for a new trial, the attorneys said his sentence should be vacated and reduced.

The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is the last major sticking point in Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union, and both sides are trying to work out how to monitor and regulate trade over the border.
Last week the Democratic Unionist Party's leader, Arlene Foster, said avoiding a customs border which separates Northern Ireland from mainland Britain was a ""blood red"" line for the party, ratcheting up rhetoric on the issue.
On Monday, Foster said this remained a red line but struck a more conciliatory tone.
""I want to see the United Kingdom exit the EU in a sensible manner which works for each part of the UK but also importantly in a way that works for our nearest neighbor in the Republic of Ireland,"" she said in a statement ahead of talks.
Foster will meet Barnier and representatives of EU states in Brussels over the next three days.
EU sources told Reuters on Thursday that EU negotiators see the outline of a compromise on the Irish border issue which is holding up Brexit talks, raising hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal.

A second source said Barnier was looking at where the bloc could make improvements to what it has offered London as both sides race to overcome the remaining obstacles to a Brexit deal before a high-stakes EU summit on Oct. 17-18.

The disappearance of Khashoggi, previously a prominent newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia and an adviser to its former head of intelligence, has sparked global concern, particularly after Turkish sources said at the weekend that authorities believed he was killed inside the consulate.
Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Saudi policy in the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent. On Tuesday he entered the consulate in Istanbul to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but his fiancee, who was waiting outside, said he never appeared.
""We have to get an outcome from this investigation as soon as possible. The consulate officials cannot save themselves by simply saying 'he has left',"" Erdogan told a news conference in Budapest, where he is on an official visit.
Erdogan, who said he was personally following the case, added that Turkey had no documents or evidence at hand regarding the case.
A Saudi source at the consulate has denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless. The consulate has also denied that Khashoggi was abducted.
Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
His disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
TURKEY ASKS TO SEARCH
Turkey has asked for permission to search Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, broadcaster NTV said on Monday.
A Turkish official also said Saudi Arabia's envoy to Ankara had been summoned to the foreign ministry for a second time on Sunday. ""It has been conveyed to him that we expect full coordination in the investigation process,"" the official said.
The two Turkish sources told Reuters Turkish authorities believe Khashoggi was deliberately killed inside the consulate, a view echoed by one of Erdogan's advisers, Yasin Aktay, who is also a friend of the Saudi journalist.
Erdogan told reporters on Sunday that authorities were examining camera footage and airport records as part of their investigation.

Saudi Arabia's consul in Istanbul opened up his mission to Reuters on Saturday in an effort to show that Khashoggi was not on the premises.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>","U.S. economists win Nobel for work on climate change, innovation","By Simon Johnson and Niklas Pollard
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Americans William Nordhaus and Paul Romer, pioneers in adapting the western economic growth model to focus on environmental issues and sharing the benefits of technology, won the 2018 Nobel Economics Prize on Monday.
In a joint award that turned the spotlight on a rapidly shifting global debate over the impact of climate change, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the duo's work was helping to answer basic questions over how to promote long-term, sustainable prosperity.
Romer, of New York University's Stern School of Business, is best known for his work on endogenous growth, a theory rooted in investing in knowledge and human capital. He said he had been taken by surprise by the award, but offered a positive message.
""I think one of the problems with the current situation is that many people think that protecting (the) environment will be so costly and so hard that they just want to ignore them,"" he told a news conference via telephone. ""We can absolutely make substantial progress protecting the environment and do it without giving up the chance to sustain growth.""
He told reporters he had long ago decided he would never seek to win the prize because doing so can ""tear you apart."" He initially missed the early morning call from Sweden telling him he won before calling back, when he was asked if would accept the prize.
""'I didn't ever want it, but, yeah, I'll accept!'"" he recalled replying at a separate news conference later at New York University.
Hours before the award, the United Nations panel on climate change said society would have to radically alter the way it consumes energy, travels and builds to avoid the worst effects of global warming. The panel declined to comment on Monday's award. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax, and last year announced that he would withdraw the United States from a global pact to combat it reached in 2015, calling the deal's demands for emissions cuts too costly. 
Nordhaus, a professor of economics at Yale University, was the first person to create a quantitative model that described the interplay between the economy and the climate, the Swedish academy said. 
""We overslept and when we got up, I got a nice call from my daughter,"" Nordhaus told Reuters at his home in New Haven, Connecticut. ""She said, 'Dad, you won. It's so nice.' It was a really lovely call. It's a nice way to find out.""
He said he was being honored for his work on carbon tax as a mechanism to reduce global warming. ""It was for work on one of the most important problems the globe faces, which is climate change,"" he said. ""I've been working on that for almost 40 years, and the time's ripe.""
BIG GLOBAL QUESTIONS
Nobel committee chair Per Stromberg told Reuters Monday's award was honoring research into ""two big global questions"": how to deal with the negative effects of growth on the climate and ""to make sure that this economic growth leaves prosperity for everyone.""
Romer had shown how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to innovate, helping some societies grow many times faster than others. By understanding which market conditions favor the creation of profitable technologies, society can tailor policies to promote growth, the academy said.
Romer's career has taken him outside the academic world. While on leave from the Stern School, he served as chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank until early this year.
His work on endogenous growth theory is not universally admired.
Fellow Nobel economics Laureate Paul Krugman told the New York Times in 2013 that too much of it involved ""making assumptions about how unmeasurable things affected other unmeasurable things.""
Monday's award of the last of the 2018 Nobels took place less than a month after the 10th anniversary of the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers.
That triggered an economic crisis from which the world's financial system is arguably still recovering. 
Interest rates remain at or close to record lows in many major economies, including Sweden, where they have languished below zero since early 2015.
Worth 9 million Swedish crowns ($1 million), the economics prize was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of five awards set out in Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's 1895 will.
The physiology/medicine, physics, chemistry and peace prizes were awarded last week.
This year's proceedings have been overshadowed by the absence of the literature prize, postponed to give the Swedish Academy time to restore public trust after a sexual assault scandal.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 12:48PM ET</span>","Britain, EU play game of chicken in Brexit countdown","By William James and Gabriela Baczynska
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain said on Monday it could not agree a divorce deal with the European Union without a framework pact on future relations, throwing down the gauntlet to the bloc which also says it cannot move on talks until London does.
Both sides are eyeing significant progress at an Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels but in different sequences - Prime Minister Theresa May wants to see the EU's proposal for post-Brexit ties while the EU seeks a new offering from her on the Irish border.
What is up in the air is timing - who plays their hand first, and after several days of positive noises about movement at the next summit, both sides are now tempering expectations.
May's spokesman repeated Britain's line on Monday that Brussels should budge first and that ""there can be no withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework"".
""There's a difference between people talking optimistically about a deal, and a deal including both the withdrawal agreement and the future framework, actually being agreed,"" he said.
The 27 remaining members of the EU might delay work on fleshing out their proposal for strong trade ties after Brexit and will instead focus on their own preparations this week, including contingencies for a ""no-deal"" scenario - given the profound divisions within May's camp over the terms of Brexit. 
Negotiations on ending four decades of Britain's membership in the EU have entered their final stage, more than two years after Britons voted narrowly for Brexit in a referendum.
Top EU officials sounded upbeat last week about chances for a withdrawal deal as soon as next week's summit. 
But London has yet to present in writing a new proposal for the biggest hurdle in talks now - how to avoid extensive, post-Brexit checks along the 500 km (320 miles) of border between EU member state Ireland and Britain's Northern Ireland province that will become the only EU-UK land frontier.
EU officials and diplomats say the bloc will not put forward its proposal for future trade before reaching an agreement with Britain on an emergency fix that would keep the Irish border open - preserving a key aspect of a 1998 peace treaty that ended decades of sectarian bloodshed - regardless of how Brexit goes. 
""Joint priority: ensuring the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom to protect the rights of citizens, investments and geographic indication (locally made products protected by EU law),"" chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday after meeting the Italian prime minister.
""This is the basis of trust for an ambitious future economic and strategic partnership (with Britain).""
But Britain wants Brussels to first propose its vision of a future trade relationship. ""There remain big issues to work through,"" May's spokesman said.
""CARROT AND STICK""
Given May's struggles in swinging her divided Conservatives behind her negotiating approach, any final withdrawal agreement may well have to wait until a special EU summit in mid-November. 
Barnier was to present his ""Outline of New Relationship with the UK"" at the bloc's executive European Commission on Wednesday. But EU diplomats and officials said on Monday the focus of their session would instead be on the EU's own Brexit preparations, including for a ""no-deal"" outcome.
That could upset London by offering up dire examples of the potential collapse in transport and other economic ties in case the sides fail to agree on a managed divorce - although May's government has itself released reports attesting to the likely disruptions of Britain crashing out of the EU. 
""It's a carrot-and-stick approach - we are trying to push them into a deal,"" a senior EU diplomat said of the change of tone from talking up progress last week to returning this week to no-deal preparations.
The EU insist Britain come to terms on its withdrawal treaty, notably now on the Irish border ""backstop"", before Barnier enters into talks on a future trading relationship. 
The bloc's negotiators believe abandoning this sequencing would allow Britain to stall on the Irish issue. They are only expected to present to member states their outlines for future ties early next week.
London, on the other hand, has long been keen to do withdrawal and subsequent trade deals in parallel, arguing that the solution on Ireland lies in future smooth EU-UK trade.
Barnier's boss, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, acknowledged at the weekend that it was hard to keep the two issues - Ireland and future trade - strictly separate.

The Roman Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland among other countries.
In stark contrast, in Poland, a deeply Catholic country, debate has only just begun while activists close to the nascent anti-pedophilia project, called ""Nie lekajcie sie"" (Don't Be Afraid), say that around 600 priests in Poland may have inclinations towards pedophilia.
Around 100 people claiming to have been sexually molested by Polish priests phoned to tell their stories in the first 24 hours after organizers of the panel posted an interactive pedophilia map on the Internet on Sunday.
""The map of pedophilia was viewed by 500,000 people since yesterday. Public discussion has started and we want to set up a panel early next year to tackle the issue,"" Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an opposition MP, told Reuters TV.
The map documents 280 cases of pedophilia committed by 60 priests convicted by Polish courts, but according to activists the real numbers are much higher since victims are often afraid to speak up for psychological and social reasons. 
""One-hundred people have called us since yesterday to tell us about their cases, and we need to research and verify all these cases,"" Scheuring-Wielgus said.
Several left-wing and liberal MPs, along with rights activists, declared their support in creating or running the investigative panel. The ruling nationalist (PiS) party, whose core support comes from devout Catholics and the Church, is not expected to be involved.
A PiS spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment, nor was a spokesman for Poland's Church.
Last week a Polish court upheld a landmark ruling granting a one million zlotys ($266,084.83) in compensation and an annuity to a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, accepting that the church ore responsibility for the crimes of its cleric.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's anti-graft prosecutors should focus on ""complex"" cases, not ""easy crimes"" such as abuse of office, the government's nominee for chief prosecutor said on Monday.
The comments by Adina Florea, a little-known magistrate nominated for the post last month by the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD), will fuel concerns among the government's critics that it is not serious about tackling graft in Romania, one of the European Union's most corrupt states.
The government's decision in February to remove Florea's predecessor, Laura Codruta Kovesi, brought thousands of protesters onto the streets. Kovesi had drawn praise at home and abroad for her efforts to convict high-level politicians, but the justice minister accused her of exceeding her authority.
Speaking before a judicial advisory panel, part of her confirmation process, Florea said cases of abuse of office should be investigated by regular prosecutors, not the specialized unit, known as the DNA, that deals with graft.
""Data... shows the DNA has focused chiefly on abuse of office. I don't think its role is to investigate easy crimes but rather those produced through complex schemes,"" she said.
Several PSD members, including party leader Liviu Dragnea, are under investigation or on trial for corruption. Dragnea has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by the Supreme Court on for inciting others to abuse of office. He denies any wrongdoing and has appealed the ruling.
The panel of magistrates questioning Florea on Monday voted against her nomination but its opinion is not binding.
OVERHAUL
The justice ministry has said it will submit her nomination to President Klaus Iohannis for approval, irrespective of the magistrates' opinion. Iohannis is a strong critic of the PSD and its stance on corruption.
Since taking power last year, the PSD has begun overhauling the judiciary and changing legislation to try decriminalize several graft offences, in moves criticized by the EU.
Dragnea, who is also speaker of the lower house, was found guilty of keeping two women on the payroll of a state agency in 2006-2013 even though they were employed by his party. He denies any wrongdoing.
Supporters of the PSD point to its efforts to raise wages and pensions. 
However, the PSD lost what had been seen as a key popularity test in a weekend referendum that aimed to change the constitution to prevent same-sex couples being able in the future to secure the right to marry.
The change, backed by the leftists, failed due to low turnout. Some analysts said voters had viewed the referendum as a ruse by the PSD to divert attention from more pressing concerns.
""It was a political boycott. People rejected the attempt to hide important issues such as corruption and attacks on the rule of law behind a populist theme,"" said independent political commentator Cristian Patrasconiu.

Security forces launched a large-scale operation in February to crush militants who have waged an insurgency that has killed hundreds of security forces and residents over many years.
Their deaths bring the total of suspected Islamist militants killed since the beginning of the operation to at least 509, according to Reuters calculations based on military statements.
The statement described those killed as ""very dangerous"" and said they were in possession of automatic rifles, ammunition, grenades and a drone.
Half of the militants were killed in al-Arish, the capital of North Sinai province, the statement said. Three military personnel were killed, it said.
Militants in Sinai intensified their attacks after the ousting by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the military in 2013 of Egypt's first freely elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Defeating the militants and restoring security after years of unrest has been a promise of Sisi, re-elected in March in a landslide victory against no real opposition.
Sisi's critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent. Supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A Serb nationalist who opposes Bosnia as a state won a share of its tripartite presidency, election results showed on Monday, as Serb, Croat and Muslim ethnic parties dominated their regions in voting likely to slow the country's march toward EU integration.
The largest parties from Bosnia's Serb, Muslim and Croat communities, which have been in power most of the time since its 1992-95 war ended, mostly entrenched their domination of all layers of Bosnia's complex government.
Since the war, which killed 100,000 people, Bosnia has been divided between a Serb Republic and a federation of Croat and Muslim cantons, with a presidency formed of one member from each of the three main groups.
The solid grip of ethnic parties has frustrated efforts to reform the economy and win Bosnia admission to Western organizations such as the European Union and NATO.
""Yesterday's election, much like previous elections in Bosnia, will serve to perpetuate the political deadlock and make the country's EU and NATO accession difficult,"" said Marko Attila Hoare, political analyst and Balkan historian.
The SNSD party of pro-Russian Serb nationalist Milorad Dodik was on course to be the strongest single party in Bosnia, and, along with coalition partners, set to dominate both the Serb caucus in the national parliament and the parliament of the autonomous Serb Republic.
Dodik, who campaigned on the secession of the Serb Republic and integration with Serbia, also won the Serb seat in the tripartite presidency of a country he has repeatedly denounced as an ""impossible state"". His ally Zeljka Cvijanovic was elected to take over Dodik's former job as president of the Serb region.
The largest Muslim Bosniak party SDA secured the most votes in Bosnia's autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation and its Bosniak Muslim-dominated cantons. Its candidate Sefik Dzaferovic won the Bosniak seat in the inter-ethnic presidency. 
A coalition led by the largest Croat party HDZ won the most votes of Croats in the Federation parliament and in the majority Croat cantons. However, its leader Dragan Covic lost the seat in the presidency to Zeljko Komsic, seen as a more moderate figure. 
Hoare said the election meant ""things will get worse before they get better, as the Republika Srpska, where Dodik has won another victory, may eventually make a bid for independence - possibly with Russian backing.""
INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS LOOMING?
More than two decades after the war, the leading Serb, Croat and Muslim Bosniak parties campaigned on nationalist tickets, reviving wartime pledges while failing to offer clearly defined economic or political visions.
International election monitors said the vote was generally orderly despite some reported violations.
But Mavroudis Voridis, the special coordinator of an observer mission from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said formation of institutions was uncertain due to a failure of the Bosniak and Croat parties to agree on changes to the election law before the vote.
Dodik said on Monday his party would clinch a partnership with the HDZ in the Council of Ministers, which is the de facto national government, and in the national parliament.
""Bosnia is heading towards the institutional crisis when it comes to the presidency,"" said Alida Vracic, the executive director of the Populari think tank, referring to the possible disagreement between Dodik and moderate Komsic.

But deals will be easier to make at other government levels where the three nationalist parties have ruled together over the years, Vracic added.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 11:28AM ET</span>",Far-right Brazil candidate snubs 'peace and love' after winning first round,"By Gabriel Stargardter and Pedro Fonseca
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday he would stick to tough rhetoric in campaigning for the second round of Brazil's bitterly contested presidential election, after his strong win in first-round voting sent financial markets soaring.
Bolsonaro, a former Army captain and veteran lawmaker, nearly won the presidency outright in Sunday's first-round election, taking 46 percent of votes to leftist Fernando Haddad's 29 percent, in a major shift to the right in Latin America's largest nation. 
As neither candidate won an outright majority, Bolsonaro will face Haddad, the former mayor of Sao Paulo representing the Workers Party (PT), in an Oct. 28 second-round vote.
Some Bolsonaro supporters called on him to moderate his message to ensure victory, but the candidate said he would stick to hardline rhetoric on crime and corruption that has resonated with voters. Many people in Brazil, the world's fifth most populous country, are disillusioned with traditional parties. 
""I can't turn into a Little 'Peace and Love' Jair, which would be betraying who I am,"" Bolsonaro said in a radio interview. ""I have to keep being the same person."" 
His words were a thinly veiled swipe at former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who dropped his fiery leftist rhetoric to win the presidency in 2002, dubbing himself the 'Peace and Love' candidate. 
Lula, the founder of the Workers Party, was president until 2010, but is now serving 12 years in prison on corruption charges.
Reflecting confidence that he will win the second round, Bolsonaro said he had already begun talks with other lawmakers in Congress to build an eventual governing coalition. That raised expectations of swift, market-friendly reforms.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) jumped 5 percent, led by double-digit gains by state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) and state power companies, which Bolsonaro advisers have said they will privatize.
Bolsonaro's popularity surged as exasperated Brazilians decided he is the best chance to turn back a wave of violent crime and dismantle what prosecutors call the world's largest political graft scheme.
But a track record of fiery anti-democratic rhetoric, his stance that police should kill as many criminals as possible and his plan to block efforts to legalize abortion and gay marriage have put many voters on edge. 
'NOT HIM' 
Former Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes, who split with the PT and garnered 12 percent of first-round votes with his center-left presidential campaign, stopped short of endorsing Haddad but said he would ""fight to defend democracy.""
Asked whom he would endorse, Gomes referred to the slogan of anti-Bolsonaro protesters in recent weeks: ""Not him, certainly."" 
Brazil's next Congress was also elected on Sunday, and in a seismic shift, Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party (PSL) was poised to become the second-largest force in the legislature. 
The party would still need alliances to help push Bolsonaro's socially conservative policies and free-market reforms through Congress, which was even more deeply fragmented after Sunday's election. 
Thirty parties won seats in the lower house, up from 25 represented there before the vote.
Congressman Onyx Lorenzoni, the main political advisor to Bolsonaro, said his team was targeting individual lawmakers in parties opposed to the PT - including those in parties whose leaders do not yet support the right-winger. 
""We'll speak with anybody who wishes to talk with us now, which is interesting because many of them did not want to have a dialogue with us before the first-round vote,"" Lorenzoni said. 
This was making good on Bolsonaro's campaign pledge to end a system of horse-trading between party leaders and seek support instead from individual lawmakers, Lorenzoni said. 

Bolsonaro blames such tactics for the endemic corruption that has voters eager for radical change.

Dancing Juncker gets a laugh,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker threw a little dance move before a speech on Monday, raising a laugh in Brussels as he appeared to mimic Theresa May but angering supporters of the embattled British prime minister and her Brexit plan.
May sashayed on stage last week to the sound of Abba's ""Dancing Queen"" - a self-mocking gag about a recent trip to South Africa where she had danced with schoolchildren. May then used the stage to rally her divided party behind her efforts to negotiate a smooth withdrawal from the European Union.
Preparing to speak at a conference on Monday, Juncker was unable to start as music continued to play in the hall. Looking up from his notes, the European Commission president, whose negotiators are locked in talks with May's officials, spread his arms and moved his shoulders and hips in time with the rhythm.
A couple of seconds was enough to provoke laughter in the room as the music faded. Juncker gave a broad grin in response.
Britons were quick to spot how close his gestures were to May's before her keynote speech last Wednesday at the annual conference of her Conservative Party.
The pro-Brexit Daily Mail said he appeared to ""mock"" May, while online comments on its website reflected anger over the EU's refusal to accept the May government's terms for leaving the bloc next March.

A spokesman for Juncker, a former premier of Luxembourg, said his improvised performance was ""not directed at anyone"" and repeated that the Commission president has ""great respect"" for May.

Approval of May's handling of Brexit talks rose as high as 47 percent in the first half of 2017 but has since fallen as the government struggles to strike a deal on Britain's future relationship with the European Union.
According to the poll of around 2,000 adults, 29 percent of voters were confident May would get the right deal, up from 22 percent last month, while 53 percent thought she would not get the right deal and the rest did not know.
May, tasked with delivering Britain's exit from the European Union after a 2016 referendum which continues to divide the country, must find a way through deadlocked talks in Brussels and then convince a skeptical parliament to back the outcome.
The European Union's Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with Britain is close, diplomatic sources said last week, in a sign a compromise on the most contentious issue - the future Irish border - might be in the making though details were scarce.

The assault happened on Saturday outside a government-run boarding school in the eastern state of Bihar, police told Reuters, following a series of sexual assaults across the country that has sparked outrage.
India is the world's most dangerous country for women due to the high risk of sexual violence and being forced into slave labor, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of about 550 experts on women's issues released in June.
Earlier this year in Bihar, more than 30 girls were sexually assaulted and tortured at a shelter in Bihar. 
Saturday's attack only came to light on Monday because of the delay in filing the case. Ten people, including four women, were arrested, Mrityunjay Kumar Choudhary, Supaul's police chief, told Reuters.
The girls suffered minor injuries and were released from hospital over the weekend.
The boys, aged between 12 and 16, entered a field near the school in the village of Darpakha, about 300 km (180 miles) from the state capital, Patna, where the girls were playing on Saturday and shouted obscene comments, Choudhary said. 
The boys left after the girls protested, only to return later with a group of around 20 people armed with sticks. 
""The boys brought their mothers and others from the neighborhood,"" Baidyanath Yadav, Supaul's district chief, told Reuters. The older women also attacked the girls, he said. 
The girls returned to school, where authorities have beefed up security, on Monday, Yadav said. 
Opposition leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav took to Twitter to target Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, accusing him of maintaining a ""cunning silence"" on the violence.

The so called ""backstop"", which seeks to find a way to avoid checks on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal, has become the biggest sticking point in Brexit negotiations.
Under the disputed ""Irish backstop"" protocol of the largely completed draft withdrawal treaty, if Britain and the EU have failed to agree an open-borders EU-UK trade deal by the end of a transition period in 2020, Northern Ireland - but not mainland Britain - would remain de facto inside the EU economic space.
Sturgeon said such an arrangement would put Scotland at a disadvantage to Northern Ireland. Asked if a version of the Irish backstop should apply to Scotland, she told Sky News: ""That would be my position.

""If we are looking down the road to a situation where Belfast is still in the single market, and Glasgow is not, then any responsible first minister of Scotland is going to say 'that's a big worry for us'.""

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina launched the campaign ahead of a general election due by December, but the killings have prompted fears among rights groups of a bloody Philippine-style campaign to wipe out drugs.
The Narcotics Control Act defines methamphetamines, also known as ""yaba"", and other drugs, such as ""shisha"", as narcotics for the first time, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told reporters after the meeting chaired by Hasina.
""It proposes the death sentence as maximum punishment for producing, smuggling, distributing and using more than 5 gm of 'yaba',"" he said, adding that possession of less than 5 gm (0.18 oz) would attract a maximum jail term of five years.
Alam said the stern punishment was needed to curb the spread of the highly potent stimulant smuggled in from neighboring Myanmar. 
Bangladesh has said an influx last year of Rohingya fleeing Buddhist-majority Myanmar is partly to blame for soaring methamphetamine use.
But many Rohingya say their young people are being pushed into crime because they cannot legally work or, in many cases, receive aid. 
Hasina has vowed to continue the campaign until Bangladesh is freed of the drug menace, but critics say it as a sign of her increasingly authoritarian rule ahead of the election.
In more than a third of the killings recorded by Dhaka-based human rights group Odhikar since mid-May, the suspects were arrested before they were killed. 
The government has dismissed accusations of extrajudicial killings, saying the crackdown has popular support.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the assets must be turned over to American families of victims of the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, among others.
The hearings at the tribunal were separate from Iran's claim relating to current U.S. sanctions against Teheran.
Iran's claim in both cases is based on a 1955 Amity Treaty, which was signed 24 years before Iran's Islamic Revolution that turned the two countries into arch enemies.
""The actions at the root of this case center on Iran's support for international terrorism,"" Richard Visek, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, said on Monday, calling on the court to reject Iran's suit.
Washington announced last week it would withdraw from the Amity Treaty after the tribunal ordered the U.S. to ensure that sanctions against Iran do not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety. 
It will take a year for a withdrawal from the Amity Treaty to take effect and Iran's case against the asset seizure, which was filed in 2016, will continue regardless.
The hearings in The Hague will run until Friday and focus on U.S. objections to the U.N.'s highest court's jurisdiction. No date for a ruling has been set.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - China said on Monday it was investigating former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei for bribery and other violations, days after French authorities said the Chinese official had been reported missing by his wife after traveling to his home country. 
Under President Xi Jinping, China has been engaged in a sweeping crackdown on official corruption. On Sunday, Interpol, the France-based global police coordination body, said that Meng had resigned as its president. 
""The investigation against Meng Hongwei taking bribes and suspected violations of law is very timely, absolutely correct and rather wise,"" China's Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its website.
""The investigation of Meng Hongwei fully shows there is no privilege and no exception in front of the law, and anyone who violates the law must be severely punished,"" it added. 
Officials should never be allowed to ""negotiate terms or haggle"" over positions within the party, the ministry said, referring to China's ruling Communist Party.
French media on Sunday broadcast video of Meng's wife Grace speaking to a small group of journalists at a hotel in Lyon, her back to a TV camera in order to hide her appearance and her voice trembling.
""This is a matter for the international community. It concerns the people of my motherland,"" she said.
She showed journalists a text message on her mobile phone with an image of a knife, sent by her husband as a way of showing her that he felt he was in danger, French media reported. 
POLICE PROTECTION
Meng, 64, became president of the global police cooperation agency in late 2016 amid a broader effort by China to secure leadership posts in international organizations. His appointment prompted concern at the time from rights groups that Beijing might try to leverage his position to pursue dissidents abroad.
""Meng's sudden disappearance ... has clearly undermined China's own efforts and has lent credence to those who said previously that China was not ready to take on such important international leadership roles,"" said Paul Haenle, Director at the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center in Beijing.
France's Interior Ministry said on Friday that Meng's family had not heard from him since Sept. 25, and French authorities said his wife was under police protection in Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, after receiving threats.
Presidents of Interpol are seconded from their national administrations and remain in their home post while representing the international policing body. 
A source at the agency declined to say whether it was usual for an Interpol president to bring his family to France, or whether Interpol provided housing for Meng.
Meng's predecessor, Frenchwoman Mireille Ballestrazzi, lived in Paris and traveled to Lyon for meetings when her presence was required.

China's foreign ministry said on Monday that China would continue to provide support for Interpol's work.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will reshuffle his cabinet this week after the resignation of his interior minister, as allies press for a broad rejig to draw a line under a tumultuous few months.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe could submit his government's resignation to Macron as early as Monday, French media reported. Macron would then ask Philippe to form a new government, on which parliament, dominated by Macron's ruling party, would hold a vote of confidence.
Macron has seen his popularity slump as voters grow frustrated with a leader seen increasingly as arrogant and out of touch, and are impatient with the sluggish pace of economic growth and job creation. 
""We need to remain true to our initial project, but we need a breath of fresh air,"" Richard Ferrand, speaker of the National Assembly and close ally of Macron told the Journal du Dimanche.
The departure of Gerard Collomb against Macron's wishes exposed chinks in the armor of a president who has sought to lead with a tight grip on decision-making but who lacks political experience, having never previously held elected office. 
Macron and Philippe were due to have lunch together on Monday, a weekly event, after being in ""close contact"" over the weekend, according to a source in the prime minister's office. 
Officials neither confirmed nor denied that a wide reshuffle was on the cards. A presidency source said nothing was finalised and the reshuffle was still being worked on. 
Collomb was the third minister to resign in five weeks, raising questions over the durability of the government, after the resignations of the popular ecology minister Nicolas Hulot and sports minister Laura Flessel.
Particularly damaging to Macron were Collomb's criticisms that the president displayed a ""lack of humility"" and that there were few around him who would speak their mind frankly.
A reshuffle presents Macron with a delicate balancing act. While a big rejig covering key posts such as the finance and foreign ministries might deliver a message of renewal, it could also be seized on by opponents as an admission of failure.
Political analysts have also said centrist Macron was likely to want to reshuffle his cabinet - that comprises ministers from the left and right - after next May's European elections in response to the results of a vote that will come two years into his five-year mandate.

""We need to show more audacity with a big reshuffle, which we should have done as soon as Hulot left,"" a lawmaker from the ruling Republic on the Move party told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The devil is alive and well and working overtime to undermine the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis says.
In fact, the pope is so convinced that Satan is to blame for the sexual abuse crisis and deep divisions racking the Church that he has asked Catholics around the world to recite a special prayer every day in October to try to beat him back.
""(The Church must be) saved from the attacks of the malign one, the great accuser and at the same time be made ever more aware of its guilt, its mistakes, and abuses committed in the present and the past,"" Francis said in a message on Sept. 29.
Since he was elected in 2013, Francis has made clear that he believes the devil to be real. In a document in April on holiness in the modern world, Francis mentioned the devil more than a dozen times.
""We should not think of the devil as a myth, a representation, a symbol, a figure of speech or an idea. This mistake would lead us to let down our guard, to grow careless and end up more vulnerable,"" he wrote in the document.
The Church has recently been hit by one sexual abuse scandal after another, from Germany, to the United States, to Chile. At the same time, a deepening polarization between conservatives and liberals in the Church has played out on social media.
Francis' use of the term ""the great accuser"" to describe Satan hit a raw nerve with one of the pope's harshest conservative critics, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the Vatican's former ambassador to Washington.
    
CHURCH DIVISIONS
In an 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Viganò launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials.
He accused Francis of knowing about sexual misconduct by a former U.S. cardinal with male adult seminarians but not doing anything about it.
Viganò, concluding that his former boss had singled him out as the devil in disguise, complained in his next statement that Francis ""compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church, though without ever uttering my name"".
On Sunday, a top Vatican official issued a scathing open letter accusing Viganò of mounting a ""political frame job devoid of real foundation"" and contesting his accusations against the pope point by point.
Francis is so convinced that Satan is ultimately to blame for both the sexual abuse scandals and the divisions within the Church that he has enlisted the aid of spiritual big gun - St. Michael the Archangel. Michael is mentioned several times in the Bible as the leader of the angels who ousted Lucifer, the fallen angel, from paradise.
Catholics are being asked to recite the rosary daily in October and conclude it with a prayer to St. Michael that was said after Mass until 1964 but then fell into disuse. 
The prayer reads:

""St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi aired their grievances in the open on Monday during a brief visit to Beijing by Washington's top diplomat, amid worsening relations.
While the exchange included typical diplomatic pleasantries, and the two officials emphasized the need for cooperation, their remarks before journalists at the start of their meeting at Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guest House were unusually pointed.
""Recently, as the U.S. side has been constantly escalating trade friction toward China, it has also adopted a series of actions on the Taiwan issue that harm China's rights and interests, and has made groundless criticism of China's domestic and foreign policies,"" Wang said at a joint appearance with Pompeo.
""We believe this has been a direct attack on our mutual trust, and has cast a shadow on China-U.S. relations,"" he added. ""We demand that the U.S. side stop this kind of mistaken action.""
Wang also urged the United States to stop selling arms to Taiwan and to cut off official visits and military ties with the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.
Pompeo, who was briefing Wang following his visit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said, ""The issues that you characterized, we have a fundamental disagreement.
""We have great concerns about the actions that China has taken, and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss each of those today because this is an incredibly important relationship.""
Pompeo and Wang openly disagreed over which side had called off a two-way security dialogue that had been planned in Beijing this month.
""PROFOUND CHANGES""
Last week, Vice President Mike Pence stepped up the U.S. pressure campaign against Beijing, going beyond the trade war by accusing China of both ""malign"" efforts to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of next month's congressional elections and of reckless military action in the South China Sea.
Pompeo also met China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a Politburo member who heads the ruling Communist Party's foreign affairs commission, though remarks before reporters took a more conventional tone, even as both agreed relations faced many challenges.
Pompeo did not have a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a fact that a senior U.S. State Department official on the trip said was not strange, even though top U.S. officials often meet Chinese heads of state on visits.
Pompeo wished Xi a happy birthday when the two met on a trip to Beijing in June.
But the senior U.S. official said the United States still expected cooperation with Beijing on efforts to denuclearize North Korea, whose chief ally is China.
""I would certainly expect so,"" the official said. ""That's a very important issue, and they recognize that, and accept that, and realize that.""
If ties between the two countries continued to deteriorate, there could be ""profound changes"" in the strategic environment for such regional issues as North Korea, China's state-backed Global Times tabloid warned in an editorial. 

""For Asia, the severity of China-U.S. frictions is taking up much attention and is, to some extent, diluting attention paid to the Korean peninsula issue,"" it said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Two former prime ministers of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, facing allegations of treason appeared before a court along with a prominent journalist on Monday in a hearing to determine whether the case should go to trial. 
The hearing was adjourned until Oct. 22.
The case related to an interview Sharif gave to the English daily Dawn in which he was quoted as suggesting the Pakistani state played a role in the militant attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people in 2008.
India has repeatedly accused Pakistan intelligence agency of helping the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carry out the attack. Pakistan has denied any state involvement, but its inaction against LeT leaders remains a major stumbling block to improving relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Dawn assistant editor Cyril Almeida, who conducted the interview, had faced arrest if he failed to appear before the court and had been barred from leaving the country. Both the arrest orders and travel restrictions were removed on Monday. 
""The court removed his name from the (exit control list), withdrew his arrest warrant and directed us to submit a reply on Oct. 22,"" Almeida's lawyer Ahmad Rauf told Reuters, while surrounded by activists protesting threats to media freedom in Pakistan.
Sharif was removed from office last year by the Supreme Court over corruption allegation and was sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison. Abbasi replaced his party leader as prime minister before an election earlier this year brought former cricket star Imran Khan to power.
Sharif has denied wrongdoing and accused the military of using the courts to orchestrate his removal and destabilise his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party to pave the way for Khan's election victory. Both the military and Khan deny that.
The inclusion of Almeida in the treason complaint has heightened concern over media freedom in Pakistan. 
A report released by the Washington-based Committee to Protect Journalists last month said the military had established ""lines of control"" to pressure the media and journalists in Pakistan, and those who pushed back faced arrest, intimidation, and violence. 
The military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history, denies any pressure on the media.

The Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal by Asia Bibi, a mother of four, who in 2010 became the first woman to be sentenced to death under Pakistan's draconian blasphemy laws. This is due to be her final appeal, media reported.
Her case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, where two politicians who sought to help Bibi were assassinated, including Punjab governor Salman Taseer, who was shot by his own bodyguard.
The ultra-religious Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party, which makes punishing blasphemy its main campaign rallying cry and lionizes the bodyguard who killed Taseer, warned the court against any ""concession or softness"" for Bibi.
""If there is any attempt to hand her over to a foreign country, there will be terrible consequences,"" TLP said in a statement.
Insulting Islam's prophet is punishable by death under Pakistani law, and blasphemy accusations stir such emotions that they are almost impossible to defend against. Dozens have been killed following blasphemy claims, sometimes by mobs of men.
TLP won over 2 million votes in the July 25 elections, though it has no parliamentarians in the National Assembly and only holds two provincial seats. But it wields outsized influence due to street power of its die-hard supporters. 
In November, TLP staged a crippling blockade of the capital after a tweak to a religious oath, which it claims was tantamount to blasphemy. Seven people were killed and more than 200 wounded in clashes with the police and TLP's supporters only dispersed after striking a deal with the military.
In May, an extremist linked to TLP shot and wounded Pakistan's then-Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal.
Bibi was sentenced to death for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
Bibi has always denied blaspheming and her representatives have claimed she was involved in a dispute with her neighbors and that her accusers had contradicted themselves.
Rights groups say the blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores. The law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offense. 

""Aasia Bibi has become a symbol of all that happens to religious minorities where class and prejudice intersect and a dysfunctional justice system is unable to protect Pakistan’s non-Muslim citizens,"" the English-language Daily Times said in an editorial on Monday.

Nene has become a divisive figure after testimony he gave at an inquiry into allegations of corruption by the Guptas, in which he admitted to the previously undisclosed visits. He made a public apology about the matter on Friday.
Zuma and the Guptas, who face numerous allegations of using their friendship for mutual self-enrichment, have consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Business Day cited unidentified government sources as saying that Nene made the request to Ramaphosa at the weekend. Nene did not answer calls for comment.
""Government sources said Nene approached Ramaphosa after the highly negative public reaction to his apology to South Africans on Friday for the meetings with the Gupta family when he served under Zuma,"" the South African newspaper said.
It said the issue was likely to be raised at a meeting of the ruling African National Congress party later on Monday.
The rand fell more than one percent on the report.
Treasury spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane referred Reuters to the presidency for comment. Ramaphosa's spokeswoman Khusela Diko did not respond to phone calls.
Nene is a key ally of Ramaphosa, who reappointed him finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle shortly after he became president earlier this year.
Ramaphosa has made clean governance and the kick-starting of an economy mired in recession top priorities.
Several ministers and government officials have been implicated in the widening graft scandals around the Guptas.
One common theme that has emerged is visits to the family's sprawling Johannesburg property, which is why there has been public anger regarding Nene's revelations.
Nene has also been praised by commentators for standing up to Zuma.
He told the inquiry he was fired by Zuma in December 2015 for blocking deals that would have benefited the Guptas, particularly a $100 billion nuclear power deal with Russia that could have crippled Africa's most developed economy.
But Nene's opponents say he was involved in corrupt deals with the Guptas when he was deputy finance minister and head of the state pension fund. He denies ever helping the Guptas.

Opposition parties have called for his resignation.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and to help gather data on how many will be coming back 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city.
The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront.
But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods.
The official death toll rose to 1,944 but bodies are still being recovered. No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said.
At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms. Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked.
""It's sad to see our school like this,"" said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university.
The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp. 
School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers.
""We won't force the students to come back because many are traumatized. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don't fall behind,"" he said.
The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said.
Across the city, nine schools were destroyed, 22 teachers were killed and 14 were missing, the disaster agency said, adding that 140 tents had been set up for classes.
GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo
POSITIVE THINKING
At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up.
School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake.
""Classes haven't started. We're only collecting data to find out how many students are safe,"" he said.
""I'm still waiting for the Ministry of Education to give us instructions on when to begin classes. For now, I don't think we're ready. Many children are traumatized and frightened.""
One boy chatting in the school compound with friends said he was sad so few of his class mates had shown up.
""I haven't heard from so many of them. I want to think positively; I hope they are OK,"" said Muhamad Islam Bintang Lima, dressed in the school uniform of white shirt and navy blue trousers.
Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region's main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunamis.
In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
A spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday searches for bodies would stop on Thursday.
Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues and will include memorials.
Indonesia is hosting an International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting on the island of Bali this week, which has drawn some criticism from the political opposition.
""What is the benefit for us Indonesian people, especially in this time of catastrophe,"" Fadli Zon, deputy speaker of parliament from the opposition nationalist Gerindra party, said on Twitter, taking issue with government spending on the meeting.
The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37 million) to help victims of the earthquake.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2018 03:32AM ET</span>",U.N. warns world must take 'unprecedented' steps to avert worst effects of global warming,"By Nina Chestney and Jane Chung
LONDON/INCHEON (Reuters) - Society would have to enact ""unprecedented"" changes to how it consumes energy, travels and builds to meet a lower global warming target or it risks increases in heat waves, flood-causing storms and the chances of drought in some regions as well as the loss of species, a U.N. report said on Monday.
Keeping the Earth's temperature rise to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) rather than the 2C target agreed to at the Paris Agreement talks in 2015, would have ""clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems,"" the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said on Monday in a statement announcing the report's release. 
The IPCC report said at the current rate of warming, the world's temperatures would likely reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 after an increase of 1C above pre-industrial levels since the mid-1800s.
Keeping the 1.5C target would keep the global sea level rise 0.1 meter (3.9 inches) lower by 2100 than a 2C target, the report states. That could reduce flooding and give the people that inhabit the world's coasts, islands and river deltas time to adapt to climate change.
The lower target would also reduce species loss and extinction and the impact on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, the report said.
""There were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2,"" Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters in an interview.
""And now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters,"" Krug said. 
The IPCC met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalize the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 to assess the feasibility and importance of limiting global warming to 1.5C.
The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement during the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December.
To contain warming at 1.5C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air.
UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE
The report summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 percent to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now.
Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to under 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. 
If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. 
But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks.
But the effects of not meeting the 1.5C target would mean huge changes to the world. The lower level would mean the Arctic Ocean would be free of sea ice in summer only once per century not at least once a decade under the higher target. Coral reefs would decline by a still unsustainable 70 percent to 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out under the higher increase.

""The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it,"" said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for an alliance of small island states at risk of flooding as sea levels rise.

The statement from the hardline Islamic militant group coincided with the visit of top U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been appointed to lead peace efforts with the Taliban.
Khalilzad met President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul to strategize ways to hold Afghan-led peace talks with the Taliban, whose 1996-2001 rule was ended by U.S.-led troops.
""Peace is a holy process, and the U.S. government and people are united with the Afghan government and people in this process,"" Khalilzad was quoted by Ghani's office in a statement as saying.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, joined the U.S. State Department team in September.
He is scheduled to visit Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar this week as he seeks to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table.
But the Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces, topple the government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law, have repeatedly rejected offers to hold peace talks or support the polls.
The Oct. 20 vote, seen by international partners as a dry run for presidential elections next year, has been hampered by chaotic preparations, allegations of fraud and ever-present fears of militant violence.
Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s main spokesman, said the United States was using the elections for the sole purpose of legitimizing their presence and authority.
""People are given a deceptive feeling of having free right casting their votes for the malicious purpose of minimizing their resentment against the foreign occupation,"" he said.
With less than two weeks to go before the long-delayed elections, the Taliban and Islamic State have ramped up attacks across the country. 
The fighting has underlined the struggle security forces face as the insurgents have steadily extended their control over the countryside even though they have been unable to take and hold a major city.
""The real solution of the ongoing Afghan crisis lies in the complete withdrawal of all foreign occupying forces and the restoration of a pure Islamic sovereignty,"" said Mujahid.

Western diplomats have said the fighting raises questions about the viability of the U.S. strategy to end the war, which for the past year has focused on forcing the militants, largely with more air strikes, to the negotiating table.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen has taken a defiant stance following a European Union announcement last week that it would ramp up trade pressure on Cambodia over human rights concerns.
The European Union (EU) told Cambodia on Friday it will lose its special access to the world's largest trading bloc, and said it was considering similar trade sanctions for Myanmar, adding that it was ready to punish human rights abuses in both countries.
The EU warned that it had launched a six-month review of Cambodia's duty-free access to the EU, meaning garments, sugar and other exports could face tariffs within 12 months.
Speaking to Cambodian students on Sunday as part of a trip to Japan to attend a regional meeting, Hun Sen said Cambodia must defend its sovereignty. Hun Sen has held power for three decades. 
""No matter what measures they want to take against Cambodia, in whatever way, Cambodia must be strong in its defense of its sovereignty,"" Hun Sen said during a speech to students in Tokyo shared on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Sunday.
""I say it again and again: don't exchange national sovereignty with aid, don't exchange the peace of the country with aid,"" he said.
He did not specifically comment on how the removal of trade privileges could impact exports.
The EU warned Cambodia in July that it could lose its special trade status after a general election that month returned Prime Minister Hun Sen to power.
Rights groups said the election was not fair because of the lack of a credible opposition, among other reasons. 
The main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the country's Supreme Court at the government's request last year and did not take part in the election. 
Many CNRP leaders have fled abroad and are in living in self-imposed exile. 
Cambodia's exports to the European Union were worth 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) last year, according to EU data, up from negligible levels less than a decade ago.
Cambodia's textile, garments and footwear industry are vital to its economy. Around 40 percent of its GDP comes from garment exports. 
The garments sector employs more than 800,000 workers. The EU and U.S. are the country's primary markets for exports, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Reuters was unable to reach three workers' unions for reaction on Monday. A government spokesman, Phay Siphan, was also unavailable to comment.

Cambodia is marking a national holiday from Monday to Wednesday this week with many offices closed.

About 1,587 U.S. Marines are stationed in the tropical city, strategically located on the coastal doorstep of Indonesia, as part of an annual rotation begun in 2011 in former President Barack Obama's military pivot to the Asia-Pacific region.
Colonel James Schnelle was relieved of his duties last month ""due to a loss of trust and confidence,"" immediately after reporting the incident to superiors, the spokesman, First Lieutenant Jose Uriarte, told Reuters.
Schnelle had been drinking at an Irish-themed bar on the city's nightclub strip until the early hours of Sept. 30 when he was pulled over and breath-tested, Australian Broadcasting Corporation said.
Police found him over the legal alcohol limit, the broadcaster said, and he walked the 3.4 km (2.1 miles) home and informed his superiors. In court he was fined A$500 ($353) but not convicted after pleading guilty, it added.
Schnelle had no comment, Uriarte said. 
The Marine deployment, in a city that has long supported a garrison of thousands of Australian troops, has largely been free of the tension stoked at times in Okinawa, Japan, where soldiers' bad behavior has been a lightning rod for resentment.
Lieutenant Colonel Jeramy Brady will replace Schnelle in charge of the Darwin Marines' contingent, which is scheduled to leave Darwin this month, and the matter is being investigated internally, Uriarte said.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Bolsonaro transforms tiny Brazil party into congressional powerhouse,"By Bruno Federowski and Maria Carolina Marcello
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro turned his party from a footnote in a crowded Congress into a national behemoth on Sunday, underscoring a seismic shift in Latin America's biggest nation as voters raged against the political establishment.
Sunday's strong showing for Bolsonaro allies in legislative elections defied many pollsters' forecasts and suggests the formerly undistinguished congressman could have an easier-than-expected time garnering support for tough economic reforms.
Bolsonaro's once-tiny Social Liberal Party (PSL) was poised to land 51 of the 513 seats in the lower house of Congress, according to projections by investment firm XP Investimentos, trailing only his rival Fernando Haddad's leftist Workers Party (PT), which is expected to take 57 seats. 
That would be explosive growth for a party with only eight lower house seats and no presence in the Senate before the vote.
""The PSL is a new chapter in the political history of Brazil. It's a group that embraces a single thesis of fiscal austerity, of small government, of pension reform,"" said Lucas de Aragão, a partner at political consulting firm Arko Advice.
He said that the PSL's growth improves the prospects for fiscal reforms, but acknowledged that they will still face ""furious"" opposition from the Workers Party.
By comparison, current President Michel Temer's Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), for decades a major force in governing coalitions across the political spectrum, is expected shrink to fourth place in the lower chamber with just 33 seats.
Several of the highest-profile MDB lawmakers lost their re-election bids, including Senate President Eunício Oliveira. That clears out powerbrokers who could have extracted costly concessions to pass Bolsonaro's agenda.
The results highlight voters' revolt over sweeping corruption scandals that have imprisoned dozens of politicians and businessmen, roiling traditional parties that have long defined the political debate.
SOUTHEAST STRONGHOLD
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has sworn to crack down on crime and corruption, nearly won the race outright in Sunday's first-round vote, but will face down Haddad in an Oct. 28 run-off vote.
Regardless of the result, Haddad's Workers Party will remain a force in Congress after a solid showing at the polls, especially in Brazil's poor northeast, which benefited from generous social policies during its 13 years in power.
However, the PSL dominated Brazil's two biggest states, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the populous southeast.
With 98 percent of votes tallied in that state, Bolsonaro's son Eduardo was the most-voted lower house candidate in Brazil's history, helping the PSL draw over 20 percent of the lower house vote in São Paulo.
The tally was even higher in the presidential candidate's home state of Rio de Janeiro, where his party got nearly 23 percent of votes for the lower house.
Until this year, the PSL was one of dozens of little-known parties in Brazilian politics with a handful of seats and no clear ideology, thanks to laws that make it easy to create and publicly fund new parties.
That changed when Bolsonaro arrived in March — making it his ninth party affiliation. His grassroots social media campaign electrified the PSL, pushed it further to the right and raised the profile of candidates such as former military police Major Olimpio Gomes, the most-voted candidate for the Senate in São Paulo on Sunday.
As a result, the PSL became an outlet for extremely conservative Brazilians who have lacked high-profile representatives, said political scientist Leonardo Barreto, head of consultancy Factual.
That meant siphoning votes away from center-right mainstays such as the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which is set to lose about 20 of its 49 seats due to its role in graft scandals and compromises with the unpopular Temer government.

""Society has voted in self-defense against the political system, and the PSDB had to pay for that,"" Barreto said.

The China Daily newspaper said in an editorial visa renewal was a sovereign right that no other governments were allowed to interfere in and that accusations from some foreign authorities were an attempt to attack the Chinese government.
The Financial Times newspaper said last week Hong Kong authorities had rejected an application to renew the work visa of Asia news editor Victor Mallet, who also served as the vice-president of the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC), drawing criticism from the United States and press freedom groups.
It came two months after government officials in China and Hong Kong condemned the FCC, one of Asia's leading press clubs, for hosting a speech by an independence activist, reigniting debate about the viability of the city's promised freedoms.
""Foreign governments demanding an explanation know this. What they really want is not an answer but to create the illusion that freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong is dwindling,"" the China Daily editorial said. 
""There is also the allegation that the central government is trying to 'mainlandize' the SAR ... However, the accusers' real intention is to smear the way 'one country, two systems' is being practiced,"" it said, referring to Hong Kong's official description as a special administrative region (SAR) of China.
Beijing, under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed elsewhere in China, rights that are enshrined in a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law. The principle has been practiced since Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
The Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said the visa denial had nothing to do with freedom of speech. However, it said Mallet's actions at the FCC ""damaged China's national security and undermined freedom of expression"".
""All countries and regions have things which they feel sensitive about and are unable to back down,"" it said.

""Hong Kong will get better without Mallet. The city's future doesn't need to be the concern of Mallet, the UK government or Western media,"" the Global Times said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twenty people were killed when a stretch limousine crashed into another vehicle and pedestrians in the parking lot of a store in rural upstate New York, in what federal authorities on Sunday called the deadliest U.S. transport crash in nearly a decade.
A 2001 Ford Excursion that had been stretched into a limousine charged through a highway intersection without stopping on Saturday afternoon, New York State Police and the National Transportation Safety Board said on Sunday. 
The limo then hit an unoccupied 2015 Toyota Highlander in the parking lot of a tourist restaurant and slammed into two pedestrians, killing all 18 occupants of the limo and the two people in the parking lot, state police and the NTSB said. 
""Twenty fatalities is just horrific. I have been on the board for 12 years and this is one of the biggest loss of lives that we've seen in a long time,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told a news conference on Sunday.
On Sunday, emergency vehicles clustered near the parking lot of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Barrel Country Store, the scene of the crash, in Schoharie, about 40 miles (65 km) west of the state capital, Albany. 
It was the deadliest transportation accident in the United States since a 2009 plane crash in Buffalo, New York, that killed 49 people, Sumwalt said.
FOUR SISTERS DIED
The dead included at least two pairs of newlyweds, the New York Times reported. No injuries were reported.
Barbara Douglas, the aunt of four sisters who died in the crash, said the victims were smart, beautiful and lived life to the fullest.
""I don't know how you say it. You can't wrap you head around such a tragedy where you have four of your daughters die,"" she told reporters at the scene.
""I don't know what to tell you, they were the best nieces that anybody could have,"" she said.
Names of the victims have not been released pending notification of the next of kin. The NTSB and the New York State Police were probing the cause of the crash and looking into safety regulations in the limousine industry.
The victims were taken to Albany Medical Center where autopsies were conducted. All those killed were adults, state police said.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik and Sefik Dzaferovic, the candidate of the largest Muslim Bosniak party, have won the Serb and Bosniak seats in Bosnia's triumverate presidency, the election commission said early Monday.
Moderate Croat Zeljko Komsic, who already served two terms in the presidency, won the Croat seat with 49.5 percent of the vote, winning over nationalist Dragan Covic from the largest Croat party, HDZ. 
Dodik secured 55 percent of the vote and Dzaferovic 38 percent, based on about 42 percent of counted ballots, election commission President Branko Petric said at a news conference.
The turnout was 53.3 percent of voters, Petric said.
The ballot was a test for Bosnia to determine if it will progress toward European Union membership and NATO integration or remain held back by ethnic rivalries.
More than two decades after a war in which 100,000 died, leading Serb, Croat and Muslim Bosniak parties campaigned on nationalist tickets, reviving wartime pledges while failing to offer any clear economic or political visions.
About 1.7 million voters took part in the presidential and parliamentary elections, choosing members of Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, consisting of a Bosniak, a Croat and a Serb, and lawmakers for parliament's lower house.
They also voted for leaders and assemblies of its two autonomous regions - the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, and of the federation's 10 cantons.
Dodik, a pro-Russian leader who has repeatedly advocated secession of the Serb Republic and integration with Serbia, earlier proclaimed victory in his party stronghold in the northern town of Banja Luka.
Analysts believe that he will work to weaken the presidency.
""My first priority will be the position of the Serb people and of the Republika Srspka,"" Dodik said, referring to Bosnia's autonomous region that he has presided over until now.
""I believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina also may progress if everyone is respected,"" he added.
Covic said he garnered the majority of Croat votes and that Komsic won only due to Bosniak votes. The HDZ had argued for the creation of new ethnically based election units in which Croats would vote only for their ethnic candidate.
""Such election results may cause an unprecedented crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"" Covic said in the southern town of Mostar.
There is a realistic possibility that the formation of the Federation parliament's upper house may be blocked after the Bosniak and Croat parties failed to agree on how to change the election law before the vote.

The election commission will announce preliminary results of the parliamentary vote later on Monday.

Prosecutors in the Balkan country said that the body of 30-year-old Viktoria Marinova was found in a park in Ruse on Saturday. They identified her only by her initials.
""It is about rape and murder,"" Interior Minister Mladen Marinov told reporters. He said there was no evidence to suggest the murder was related to Marinova's work and there was no information that she had been threatened.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told reporters: ""I am convinced it is a matter of time before the murder would be revealed. The best criminologists were sent to Ruse, let's not press them. A large amount of DNA had been obtained.""
Police are expected to disclose more details on Monday.
""Her death was caused by blows to the head and suffocation, and her mobile phone, car keys, glasses and some of her clothing were missing,"" Ruse regional prosecutor Georgy Georgiev said.
Marinova, who was a board member of the Ruse-based TV station TVN - one of the most popular TV channels in northeastern Bulgaria - is the third journalist to have been murdered in the European Union in a year.
Local media reported that Marinova had recently been involved in covering an investigation by a group of Bulgarian journalists into companies involved in EU-funded infrastructure projects administered by local authorities. 
Last October Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta's best-known investigative journalist, was killed when a powerful bomb blew up her car and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February.
""With great pain and insurmountable grief the TVN's team is experiencing the loss of our beloved colleague Victoria Marinova and we pray for sympathy to the sorrow of her relatives and colleagues,"" TVN said in a short statement.
Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other EU member and also lower than other countries in the western Balkans, some of which are candidates for EU membership.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - A referendum to change Romania's constitution to prevent same sex couples from securing the right to marry failed to draw enough voters to validate the result on Sunday, after a campaign that led to a rise in hate speech against the gay community.
The vote has also been seen as popularity test of the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) that supported the change and whose attempts to weaken anti-corruption legislation have drawn criticism from the European Union's executive.
Data from the national election bureau showed voter turnout stood at 20.4 percent when the polls closed at 1800 GMT, below the 30 percent required for it to be valid.
The two-day referendum, which cost $40 million, aimed to change the constitution to define marriage as strictly between a man and a woman from the current gender-neutral ""spouses.""
Religiously conservative Romania, which decriminalized homosexuality in 2001 decades after neighboring countries, bars marriage and civil partnerships for same sex couples. 
Civil society group Coalition for the Family secured 3 million signatures to trigger the vote aimed at preventing gay couples winning the right to marry in the future.
The Coalition received backing from the Orthodox Church and other religions as well as all but one parliamentary parties.
""Romanians rejected being divided and hating each other, it is a victory for Romanian democracy and moreover, Romanians rejected the involvement of the Orthodox Church in the state’s secular affairs,"" said Vlad Viski of LGBT rights group MozaiQ.
""We believe politicians must now legalize civil partnerships for same sex couples,"" he said at a party to celebrate the outcome.
Dozens of human rights groups had said a successful referendum would embolden further attempts to chip away at the rights of minority groups and push Romania onto a populist, authoritarian track.
They have encouraged people to boycott the ballot, with several companies and popular musicians and artists following. A library chain even offered a book discount over the weekend for those who wanted to stay in and read rather than vote.
In villages across the country, people were quoted saying they had better things to do, such as canning food and making wine.
""The PSD staked everything on the referendum, by associating with it and trying to capitalize on it,"" said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.
""What remains is the fact that many citizens have associated the initiative with the PSD and that is why they boycotted it. Either way, it is a major sanction against the government.""
Senior PSD member Codrin Stefanescu accused opposition parties and centrist President Klaus Iohannis of misinforming Romanians in the run-up to the vote.
PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, whose appeal against a criminal conviction in an abuse of office case starts on Monday, told reporters after voting ""Yes"" to the change on Saturday that Romanians had to decide the kind of country they wanted.
""We all know that for years we’ve been told others know what is best for us better than we do. I believe it is time we decide what kind of society and country we want to have and how we want to live in our country,"" Dragnea said.
Days before the vote, the government relaxed anti-fraud monitoring and limited options for challenging the result.

Romania ranks 25th out of 28 EU states based on legislation, hate speech and discrimination against LGBT people, an annual study by ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organization advocating equality, showed.

Tripoli has been hit by fighting between rival armed groups competing over access to public funds and power, part of chaos in Libya since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
The violence started when some factions based outside the capital attacked late in August four factions linked to the Tripoli government.
The United Nations has been trying to impose a ceasefire by calling on a broader security arrangement.
In the reshuffle, Serraj appointed Fathi Ali Bashagha as interior minister. He comes from the western city of Misrata and is close to its armed groups, some of which took part in the Tripoli clashes.
The government also named a new economy and industry minister, Ali Abdulaziz Issawi, who comes from Benghazi in eastern Libya, home to a rival administration. Issawi is a veteran figure from the rebels who toppled Gaddafi.
Serraj's spokesman Mohamed al-Salak told Reuters in a brief phone message that the changes were made ""in the context of promoting economic and security reforms."" He did no elaborate.
The U.N. mission to Libya, UNSMIL, said on Twitter it was ready to ""support the new ministers to implement the new security arrangements in the capital Tripoli, to move forward with economic reforms and to seek the unification of Libyan national institutions.""
Megerisi, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Serraj was seeking to broaden his support as the United Nations works to unify rival bodies to prepare Libya for elections.
""The appointment of Bashagha could also be an attempt to ensure Misrata continue to support the work of the committee to implement security provisions and keep Misrata on board,"" he said.
The decree appointed Faraj Bomtari as finance minister and Bashir al-Qantri as youths and sport minister.
Ministers have struggled to make an impact as the country is effectively controlled by armed groups.

The government has been expected to announce a package of security arrangements including the withdrawal of armed groups from ministries and state institutions after the recent clashes.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - China said on Sunday it was investigating Meng Hongwei for suspected wrongdoing after the head of the global law enforcement organization Interpol and Chinese vice minister for security was reported missing in France.
The statement by a Chinese anti-graft body was the first official word from China about Meng since his disappearance was reported in France on Friday. Meng had been reported missing by his wife after traveling last month from France, where Interpol is based, to China.
""Public Security Ministry Vice Minister Meng Hongwei is currently under investigation by the National Supervisory Commission for suspected violations of law,"" the Chinese anti-corruption body said in a brief statement on its website.
Interpol said later that Meng had resigned as president of the organization, and that South Korean national Kim Jong Yang would become its acting president, while it would appoint a new president at a Nov 18-21 meeting of the organization in Dubai.
Interpol said earlier over the weekend that it had asked Beijing to clarify Meng's situation.
""Today, Sunday 7 October, (at) the Interpol General Secretariat in Lyon, France received the resignation of Mr Meng Hongwei as President of Interpol with immediate effect,"" Interpol said in a statement on Sunday.
When asked about the Chinese announcement on Sunday, France's Interior Ministry said it had no information.
The French ministry said last Friday that Meng's family had not heard from him since Sept. 25, and French authorities said his wife was under police protection after getting threats.
HUSBAND'S WARNING TO WIFE?
French police have been investigating what is officially termed in France a ""worrying disappearance"".
Local French media broadcast a video which they said was from Meng's wife Grace, in which she issued a brief statement from a hotel in Lyon to express her concerns. Reuters could not confirm the comments attributed to her.
""As long as I can't see my husband in front of me, speaking to me, I can't have any confidence,"" Grace Meng was quoted as saying by French TV stations and Sunday newspapers.
The websites of French papers broadcast video clips showing Meng speaking in a trembling voice, with her back to a TV camera in order to hide her appearance.
""This is a matter for the international community. This matter belongs to my motherland,"" she added in the video clips.
French media also reported that Meng's husband had recently sent her a mobile phone message featuring a knife image, as a way of showing her that he felt he was in danger. 
Meng, 64, was named to the post of Interpol president in late 2016, part of a broader Chinese effort to gain leadership positions in key international organizations.
Presidents of Interpol are seconded from their national administrations and remain in their home post while representing the international policing body.
Interpol, which groups 192 countries and is usually focused on finding people who are missing or wanted, is run on a day-to-day basis by its secretary general, German national Juergen Stock.
When Meng was named Interpol's president, human rights groups expressed concern that Beijing might try to leverage his position to pursue dissidents abroad. Beijing has in the past pressed countries to arrest and deport to China citizens it accuses of crimes, from corruption to terrorism.

Under President Xi Jinping, China has been engaged in a crackdown on corruption.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",German conservatives back Merkel bid for party leadership,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior German conservatives on Sunday backed Chancellor Angela Merkel's bid for re-election as chairwoman of her Christian Democrats (CDU) at a party congress in December, lending her much needed support as in-fighting weakens her authority.
Merkel has vowed to serve her full term in office until the end of the legislative period in 2021, and has said she will run to remain as chairwoman.
Her CDU party holds a vote on the chairmanship at a congress in the northern city of Hamburg in early December.
Merkel suffered an unexpected blow to her authority last month when her conservatives cast out long-standing ally Volker Kauder as head of the parliamentary party, reflecting rising discontent with her 13-year-old leadership.
The upset victory of Ralph Brinkhaus, described as a ""political thunderbolt"" and ""the beginning of the end of the Merkel era"" by opposition leaders, was widely taken as a sign that lawmakers want more say in shaping the policies of her fourth and final government.
Brinkhaus' election by the conservative block comprising Merkel's CDU and their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party - know as the Union - was a clear sign of lawmakers' frustration with her ruling style.
But parliament speaker and former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told mass-selling Bild am Sonntag newspaper that Brinkhaus election could bring some stability to the conservative block rocked by in-fighting over immigration.
""The change at the top of the parliamentary faction could stabilize the chancellor,"" Schaeuble said. ""There has been an uneasy mood within the union for some time. It is possible that (Brinkhaus' election) was an opportunity to vent out.""
The CDU and CSU have struggled to maintain a united front on immigration policy and the fate of the scandal-hit chief of the domestic spy agency.
In the summer, CSU leader and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer brought the government to the brink of collapse with a threat to turn back migrants at the border with Austria if they had already applied for asylum elsewhere in the European Union.
Seehofer, the fiercest critic of Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to almost one million, mainly Muslim asylum seekers, told Welt am Sonntag that he backed the chancellor's bid to be re-elected as CDU chairwoman.
""Angela Merkel has announced that she would like to run for the party's chairmanship. I think it is the right decision,"" Seehofer said.
Merkel said on Saturday that her conservatives must end their in-fighting to reverse slides in the polls before two regional elections this month.
Polls indicate the CSU will lose its absolute majority in the Bavarian parliament in an election in the southern state on Oct. 14, bleeding support to the ecologist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Support for Merkel's CDU is also projected to fall, to around 29 percent, in an election in the state of Hesse two weeks later. The party won 10 percentage points more in the election five years ago in Hesse, where it governs with the Greens.

""It's important what he proposed,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""There should be a comprehensive approach to the terrible problem of insecurity and violence.""
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, said on Sunday that he would also look at paying farmers more for their corn as a way to dissuade them from planting poppy seeds.

WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - Leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have been rebuked for belittling the significance of the Nazis and criticizing a Holocaust memorial, but this has not stopped a small group of Jews from throwing their support behind the party.
On Sunday they formed Jews in the AfD, a political group based in the western city of Wiesbaden that seeks to foster support for the party, which says Islam is not compatible with the German constitution.
""We are not a religious organization, we are a political organization,"" Jews in the AfD leader Wolfgang Fuhl told reporters at the inauguration ceremony, sitting on a podium with fellow Jews including a few wearing the Jewish skullcap.
He said people wishing to join had to meet two requirements: membership in the AfD and ethnic or religious association with the Jewish faith. Twenty people signed up at Sunday's meeting.
The AfD entered the German parliament for the first time in an election last year, drawing support from a broad array of voters angry with Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost a million, mainly Muslim asylum seekers.
Its success drew immediate expressions of concern from Israeli officials and Jewish groups in Europe and the United States. 
German politicians in June rebuked AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland after he said that Hitler and the Nazis ""are just bird shit in 1,000 years of successful German history.""
And Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD's leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, triggered anger last year after he told supporters that Berlin's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was a ""memorial of shame"" and that history books should be rewritten to focus more on German victims.
But Jews for AfD leader Fuhl dismissed those concerns on Sunday, saying the AfD was the most pro-Israel party in Germany, not least because it supports the Jewish state's right to have all of Jerusalem as its capital.
'PRO-ISRAEL'
""The AfD is an exceptionally pro-Israel party, supposedly the most pro-Israel party in the Bundestag,"" Fuhl said, referring to the lower house of parliament in which the AfD is the third-largest party.
Palestinians, with broad international backing, seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed, as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".
Germany, home to an estimated 200,000 Jews, has built a reputation in recent decades as a tolerant, safe place for Jews to live. The rise of the AfD has alarmed the community. 
Anti-Semitic crimes reported to the police rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017 against the same period last year, with an overwhelming majority of incidents linked to far-right extremism. The real number is probably much higher.
Members of Jews in the AfD appear unmoved by those figures.
When asked by a journalist what he would say to people who might call him a ""Nazi Jew,"" Bernhard Krauskopf said speaking in English: ""I tell them that 'you are talking to a Jewish-German person whose father lost more than 50 people in Nazi death camps, you should be a little bit more intelligent not to talk such nonsense.'""
Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said he was skeptical.
""It doesn't go together for me,"" he told Reuters. ""In the end, I have to assume that these are people who simply have not recognized the true ulterior motive, also the goals of this more than right-wing populist party.""

He added: ""I think that there are some who think, 'The AFD is a party that today predominantly campaigns against or targets refugees, migrants, Muslims'. However, I consider it completely wrong to put Muslims under general suspicion. And the formula 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' does not work.'""

La Repubblica reported on Saturday that Germany's refugee agency had sent ""dozens of letters"" to migrants advising them of a planned transfer back to Italy, possibly via charter flights. The first such transfer is planned for Oct. 9, it said.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Sunday Italy would close its airports to any planes carrying migrants from Germany or any other EU country, ratcheting up a dispute among the bloc's 28 members over how to share responsibility for asylum seekers. 
""If someone, in Berlin or Brussels, thinks of dumping dozens of immigrants in Italy via unauthorized charter flights, they should know that there is not and there will be no airport available,"" Salvini said in a statement. 
""We will close the airports as we closed the ports."" 
The two countries have been working on a deal under which Germany would send back to Italy migrants who have already applied for asylum there, but the accord has yet to be signed. 
""No transfer flight is planned to Italy in the coming days,"" a German interior ministry spokesman wrote in an email.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said last month that a deal with Italy had been reached and that he expected it to be signed shortly. But Salvini denied that a day later, demanding more concessions from Germany.
The Italian minister said at the time that he had received reassurances from Germany that for every migrant it returned to Italy the German authorities would accept a bonafide asylum seeker from Italy.
But Salvini wants concessions on two other issues - a revision of both the EU's Dublin Treaty on how Europe handles asylum requests, and of the EU's Sophia naval mission which is patrolling the Mediterranean.
Seehofer urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to intervene to end the standoff.
""The agreement has been negotiated and follows the same principle as with Greece,"" Seehofer told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. ""We return refugees back to Italy, but we must take in the same number from sea rescues.""
He added: ""But now Salvini is suddenly saying: I will only sign if Germany backs Italy's position on asylum in the European Union. The heads of government are required to act (to solve this).""
Italy is seeking an overhaul of the Dublin Treaty so that there is an automatic distribution of asylum seekers throughout the EU, instead of requiring them to stay in the country where they first touch European soil, as is the case now.
It also wants to change the mandate of Operation Sophia, which at present says that all migrants picked up in the Mediterranean must be taken to Italy.

Italy has become the main route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers arriving by sea since the other main route from Turkey to Greece was largely shut in 2016. However, numbers have fallen dramatically over the past 12 months.

President Milos Zeman's latest spat with one of the few minorities in the European Union member country began two weeks ago when he said that although he despised the former communist regime, at least it made the Roma people work.
His remarks sparked criticism, including from Roma people posting hundreds of pictures of themselves working on social media and asking the president to apologize. He declined, saying that those images were of the one tenth of Roma who actually work.
""I said clearly that I appreciate the 10 percent of Roma who work,"" Zeman said in a live interview streaming at http://www.blesk.cz when responding to a question from a Roma viewer.
""Don't forget, if you want to show solidarity with your ethnic group, those 90 percent (not working), because... they are also influencing their children,"" he said.
There are no statistics supporting Zeman's assertion. Czech NGO, Romea, called Zeman's remarks insulting. The European Roma Rights Centre in Budapest rejected his statements as racist. 
An annual report on the Roma, approved by the Czech government in August, says that as of the end of 2017, there were roughly 240,000 Roma living in the Czech Republic, or about two percent of the population. Half of the 240,000 were estimated to be ""socially excluded"". 
That term refers to people living in places where it is tough to get a job, who also are often heavily indebted.
The report also stated that the Roma population faces strong obstacles in social life, mainly due to prejudice which often prevents its members from getting a job or suitable dwelling.
A separate report showed that as of the end of August, there were a total of 230,000 people out of work in the country of 10.6 million, which enjoys the lowest unemployment in the EU thanks to solid economic growth.
Zeman is not the first Czech official to attack the Roma's work record. Prime Minister Andrej Babis was forced to apologize for remarks he made as finance minister in 2016 that Czech Roma were sent to a concentration camp during World War Two because they refused to work.

With ancestral roots in India, the Roma migrated to Europe in the 10th century and have a history marked by persecution. There are some 11 million Roma living across the continent, particularly in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Spain.

ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday he was closely following the case of missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after Turkish officials said they believed he had been killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 
Erdogan told reporters that authorities were examining camera footage and airport records as part of their investigation into the disappearance last week of Khashoggi, who had been increasingly critical of Saudi Arabia's rulers.
A former newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia and adviser to its former head of intelligence, Khashoggi left the country last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Saudi policy in the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent.
On Tuesday he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but his fiancee, who was waiting outside, said he never came out.
Two Turkish sources told Reuters Turkish authorities believe Khashoggi was deliberately killed inside the consulate, a view echoed by one of Erdogan's advisers, Yasin Aktay, who is also a friend of the Saudi journalist. 
""My sense is that he has been killed...in the consulate,"" Aktay said.
Erdogan said he was personally following the issue, without saying what he believed had happened to Khashoggi.
""Entries and exits into the embassy, airport transits and all camera records are being looked at and followed. We want to swiftly get results,"" he said, adding without explanation: ""My expectation is still positive.""
A Saudi source at the consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless. The consulate has also denied that Khashoggi was abducted.
The United States is seeking information, a State Department official said. ""We are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,"" the official said.
Khashoggi's fiancee could not immediately be contacted but she said in a Tweet that there had been no official confirmation of the Turkish sources' statements. ""Jamal was not killed and I do not believe he was killed,"" Hatice Cengiz posted.
Another Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country.
The source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them. Turkey's Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate.
DEEPENING DIVISIONS
Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
Over the past year, he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post criticizing Saudi policies toward Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained. 
""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,"" he wrote in September. ""To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.""
Two months later, writing about the detentions of scores of Saudi royals, senior officials and businessmen accused of corruption, he said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman dispensed ""selective justice"" and said there was ""complete intolerance for even mild criticism"" of the crown prince.
Khashoggi's disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
Erdogan, whose AK Party is rooted in political Islam, also supported a government in Egypt led by the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia has designated a terrorist movement. 
Erdogan's adviser Aktay told Reuters that Turkish authorities believed the group of 15 Saudi nationals were ""most certainly involved"" in his disappearance.
""The Saudis are saying we can come investigate, but they have of course disposed of the body,"" he said, adding that he believed Saudi statements about a lack of footage from security cameras were insincere.
Saudi Consul-General Mohammad al-Otaibi told Reuters on Saturday that the consulate's own security cameras showed only a live stream and did not record footage, so they could not provide evidence of Khashoggi's movements.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by reports Khashoggi may have been killed inside the consulate.

""The Saudi authorities must immediately give a full and credible accounting of what happened to Khashoggi inside its diplomatic mission,"" the CPJ said in a statement.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's High Court issued a notice to the government on Sunday asking it to justify why a prominent social activist should not be granted bail, in a case widely seen as a test for freedom of speech.
Shahidul Alam, an award-winning photographer, was detained in August on suspicion of spreading ""propaganda and false information"" during widespread student protests.
He was picked up from his home hours after giving an interview to Al Jazeera, in which he accused the government of extrajudicial killings and corruption - accusations the government dismissed.
The 63-year-old had also posted comments on social media saying that a student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling party was trying to attack the protesters - accusations that were also denied.
The High Court on Sunday heard Alam's appeal against the decision of a lower court to deny him bail last month. It issued the notice to the government and asked it to reply within a week, Alam's lawyer Shahdeen Malik told Reuters after the hearing.
Bangladesh's Attorney General Mahbubey Alam appeared in court on behalf of the government, and said bail would hamper the on-going investigation.

Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founder and first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is facing national elections in December.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Many Romanians appeared to boycott a vote on Sunday on whether to enshrine in the constitution that marriage must only be between a man and a woman, as turnout remained low on the second day of a referendum.
The vote is seen as a proxy for the popularity of the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) and has seen campaigners direct slurs at LGBT people.
The conservative European Union member already bars marriage and civil partnerships for same sex couples.
The referendum was brought about by a civil society group, called the Coalition for the Family, which raised 3 million signatures to trigger the vote to ensure gay couples never win the right to marry in the future.
The Coalition received backing from the Orthodox Church and other religions as well as all but one parliamentary party, which endorsed the referendum. 
By 1000 GMT on Sunday, eight hours before polls close, voter turnout stood at just under 12 percent. The vote needs a turnout rate of 30 percent, or more than 5 million people, to be valid by the time the polls close at 1800 GMT.
Ahead of the referendum, dozens of European Parliament members sent an open letter to Romania's prime minister telling her the referendum was a mistake that would promote hate speech against LGBT community.
Dozens of human rights groups have also warned that approval would embolden further attempts to chip away at the rights of minority groups and push Romania onto a populist, authoritarian track.
They have encouraged people to boycott the ballot, with several companies and popular musicians and artists following. A library chain even offered a book discount over the weekend for those who wanted to stay in and read rather than vote.
In villages across the country, people were quoted as saying they had better things to do, such as canning and making wine.
""The PSD staked everything on the referendum, by associating with it and trying to capitalize on it,"" said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.
""Regardless of whether it passes narrowly or if it doesn’t pass, what remains is the fact that many citizens have associated the initiative with the PSD and that is why they boycotted it. Either way, it is a major sanction against the government.""
PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, whose appeal against a criminal conviction in an abuse of office case is due to start on Monday, was undeterred after he voted on Saturday. 
""I voted for what millions of Romanians are asking, for what I believe defines us as a society and a nation,"" he told reporters.
""We all know that for years we’ve been told others know what is best for us better than we do. I believe it is time we decide what kind of society and country we want to have and how we want to live in our country,"" Dragnea said.
Two members of the election committee in his voting station refused to shake his hand.
A poll released on Friday by CURS estimated turnout would be 34 percent - above the needed 30 percent threshold - with 90 percent of those who would turn out to the polls in favor.

Romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001, decades after neighboring countries. It ranks 25th out of 28 EU states based on legislation, hate speech and discrimination against LGBT people, an annual study by ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organization advocating equality, showed.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 09:06AM ET</span>",Wife of Israeli prime minister goes on trial for fraud,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife, Sara, appeared in court on Sunday for the first hearing in the fraud trial against her, in which she is alleged to have misused state funds in ordering catered meals. 
According to the indictment, Sara Netanyahu, along with a government employee, fraudulently obtained from the state more than $100,000 for hundreds of meals supplied by restaurants, bypassing regulations that prohibit the practice if a cook is employed at home.
Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
She was charged in June with fraud and breach of trust and of aggravated fraudulent receipt of goods. If convicted, Sara Netanyahu could face up to five years in prison.
Looking tense, Netanyahu made no comment to reporters who had packed the tiny courtroom. She sat on a bench behind her lawyers. 
""Can we ask them to move the cameras away?"", she asked the lawyer for the other defendant, who replied: ""You're used to it.""
""Not like this,"" Netanyahu answered. She shook her head as the prosecutor described the gravity of her case.
The session, however, dealt mainly with procedural matters. The judge set a meeting with the prosecutors and the defendants' lawyers for Nov. 13 in which he said he hoped all sides could narrow their differences ""or even resolve the case"".
But a settlement at this stage appears remote because the prosecutors would likely demand Netanyahu plead guilty, something her lawyer has ruled out. She was not asked at the hearing to enter a plea. 
Netanyahu’s lawyers contend the indictment does not hold up because the regulations for ordering meals were legally invalid and a household employee had requisitioned the food despite Netanyahu's protestations.
The prime minister, who himself is embroiled in corruption investigations, has called the allegations against his wife absurd and unfounded. 
Sara Netanyahu, 59, has inspired a multitude of headlines in the past over what family spokesmen call an undeserved reputation for imperiousness.
In 2017 the Netanyahus won a libel suit against an Israeli journalist who said Sara once kicked her husband out of their car during an argument. In 2016, a Jerusalem labor court ruled that she had insulted and raged at household staff in the prime minister’s official residence. 
So far, Sara's present legal woes have not politically damaged her husband, now in his fourth term as Israel’s leader and riding high in opinion polls despite the allegations against him. 
Accusations he has made against the Israeli media of orchestrating a politically motivated witch-hunt against him and his wife appear to have struck a chord with his right-wing voter base, which has rallied in support of the 68-year-old leader.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to wavering British voters on Sunday ahead of a defining few months in which she hopes to secure a Brexit deal and face down opponents who say her EU exit plan is too hard, too soft, or just plain wrong.
May, tasked with delivering Britain's exit from the European Union after a 2016 referendum which continues to divide the country, must find a way through deadlocked talks in Brussels and then convince a skeptical parliament to back the outcome.
On Sunday she launched an unusual plea for the backing of center-ground voters who had previously backed the Labour Party but felt alienated by a shift to the left under current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
""I want voters who may previously have thought of themselves as Labour supporters to look at my government afresh. They will find a decent, moderate and patriotic program that is worthy of their support,"" May wrote in an article for the Observer newspaper.
Hot off the heels of a speech at her annual conference which polls showed was well received, May sought to reinforce her message that the end of over eight years of austerity was in sight, and that she was capable of delivering reform beyond Brexit.
Labour called her message on austerity a con and said she was making ""desperate pleas in an attempt to revive her failing administration"".
It looks increasingly likely May will have to rely on the support of so-called 'moderate' Labour lawmakers to win parliamentary approval for whatever Brexit deal she is able to strike with the EU.
On Sunday, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said her 35 lawmakers would likely vote against the deal, and could instead support a second public vote on the terms of Britain's EU exit.
Labour's left-wing leadership have promised to vote against May's deal unless it meets their tests - which it currently is unlikely to do.
The 10 votes of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which May relies on to prop up her minority government are also in doubt, depending on what kind of compromise May has to strike in Brussels to resolve issues over the Irish border.
Critics within May's own party, among them former foreign minister Boris Johnson, want her to ditch the current Brexit plan. However the Sunday Telegraph reported that a sizeable eurosceptic faction could be willing to drop some of their objections to secure a deal.
If May fails to win a vote in parliament, Britain faces an unmanaged exit from the bloc, which businesses and economists fear could badly damage the economy.
The outgoing chief executive of insurance market Lloyd's of London, Inga Beale, said her firm is accelerating Brexit contingency plans to transfer contracts to a Brussels subsidiary as she feel Britain is getting closer to leaving the EU without a deal.

But Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the possible negative consequences for Britain, Ireland and other EU countries meant he thought the chances of securing a deal with the EU were ""good"".

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Relatives of hundreds of people missing after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reacted with anger, sadness and resignation on Sunday to a decision by the state disaster agency to end searches for bodies later this week.
The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down shopping malls, hotels and other buildings in the city of Palu, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But perhaps more deadly was soil liquefaction which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods.
No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds, rescuers say.
The official death toll has risen to 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered, at least 34 in one place alone on Saturday and more on Sunday.
""Many of us are angry that we haven’t found our families and friends and they want to give up?"" said Hajah Ikaya, 60, who says she lost her sister, brother-in-law and niece in the Balaroa neighborhood in the south of the city. They are all missing.
Balaroa was one of areas particularly hard hit by liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, destroying houses and dragging people under the mud and debris.
The disaster agency said earlier liquefaction destroyed 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone with hundreds of people buried in the mud.
""We're Muslim. We need a proper burial, in the Islamic way,” said Ikaya. ""We don’t want this.""
Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta some limited searching might continue but large-scale searches with many personnel and heavy equipment would cease on Oct. 11.
Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues. Surveys would be carried out and people living in vulnerable places would be moved.
""We don't want the community to be relocated to such dangerous places,"" Nugroho said.
Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region's main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city.
Dede Diman, 25, a resident of Petobo, another neighborhood in Palu that was laid waste by liquefaction, said rescuers hadn't even started searching where his sister was lost.
""We're already angry,"" said Diman, who is living in a shelter with his brother and another sister. Their mother was killed and her body found.
""We don't agree with giving up. Even if they give up, we won't. We want to find our sister.”

PRAYERS
Mohammad Irfan, 25, got home to Palu on Sunday, as air services picked up, from his job on Bali island, to help search for his missing grandfather.
""I'd feel very sad if the search mission ends because there are so many still missing and buried,"" he said.
A grieving father was resigned to the search ending without his two-year-old daughter being found.
""What’s the point anyway? At this stage, they're not even recognizable,"" said Ondre, 38, who makes toys for a living.
His wife and two daughters were swept away in the tsunami that hit Palu's seafront after the earthquake. He found the bodies of his wife and older daughter but is still looking for his younger daughter.
""I don’t want her to feel like her father never tried to find her. My soul wouldn’t rest,"" he said by a mass grave atop a hill overlooking Palu's bay as the sun set, where he had come to offer prayers.
Sulawesi is one of Indonesia's five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami.
In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Earlier on Sunday, dozens of Christians gathered outside ruined churches for services to give thanks for their survival and to mourn members of their congregation killed in the disaster.
Indonesia has the world's biggest Muslim population but there are Christian communities throughout the archipelago, including in Palu.
""We are so relieved to be alive but sad because so many of our congregation died,"" said Dewi Febriani, 26, after a service in a tent outside the Toraja Church in Jono Oge village, south of Palu. 
Jono Oge was hit hard by liquefaction with dozens of teenagers at a nearby church and Bible camp killed. Many of lie buried in the mud.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A top Vatican official on Sunday issued a scathing open letter accusing an archbishop who launched an unprecedented attack on Pope Francis of mounting a ""political frame job devoid of real foundation"".
Cardinal Marc Ouellet said in the detailed, three-page letter that calls by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano for the pope to resign because he had allegedly covered up sexual misconduct by a senior American churchman were ""calumny and defamation"".
Ouellet, who heads the Vatican's powerful Congregation for Bishops, issued the letter in response to a bombshell statement on Aug. 26 by Vigano in which he accused a long list of current and past Vatican and U.S. Church officials of covering up for Theodore McCarrick, 88, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., and called on the pope to resign.
Vigano said the pope knew for years about sexual misconduct by McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., with adult male seminarians but did nothing about it.
Ouellet's stinging letter, unusually blunt between churchmen, was a point-by-point rebuttal of Vigano's statements.
He said Vigano, who is in hiding and has issued his accusations exclusively through conservative Catholic media which are traditionally antagonistic toward the pope, had let himself ""be convinced of this monstrous accusation"".
Ouellet, a Canadian, said: ""I conclude, therefore that your accusations are a political frame job devoid of any real foundation.""
He urged Vigano to ""Come out of hiding, repent for your revolt and return to better feelings toward the Holy Father instead of worsening hostility against him"".
He added: ""Should not ministers of the truth above all stay away from calumny and defamation?""
CHURCH IN TURMOIL
Vigano's statement, combined with a recent spate of sexual abuse crises in several countries, has thrown the Catholic Church into turmoil.
In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in nearly 100 years after American Church officials said allegations made in a separate investigation that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated..
That investigation was not related to the accusations that McCarrick, who rose to be a key power broker in the American Church, had engaged in sexual misconduct with adult males for years.
McCarrick has said he had no recollection of alleged abuse of the minor, but has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the seminarians, which allegedly took place mostly at a beach house in New Jersey when he was a bishop in that state.
Vigano alleged that former Pope Benedict, who resigned in 2013, had placed sanctions on McCarrick because of his sexual misconduct with adult males and had ordered him to retire to a life of prayer and penitence and refrain from public ministry.
Vigano claimed that Francis had lifted the sanctions, effectively rehabilitating McCarrick. Ouellet said this was ""false"".
In his letter, Ouellet said there had been no formal sanctions against McCarrick, who had been retired for seven years by the time Francis was elected in 2013. 
But Ouellet acknowledged that he had told Vigano that McCarrick should adhere to ""certain conditions and restrictions because of rumors regarding his past behavior"".
He also denied Vigano's assertion that McCarrick had become a ""great counselor"" to Francis. 
""I find it abhorrent that you take advantage of the clamorous scandal of sexual abuse in the United States to inflict an unheard of and unwarranted"" attack on the pope, Ouellet said.

He was referring to a grand jury report in Pennsylvania in August that found that 301 Catholic priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.

Maltese armed forces said the boat was spotted during a routine patrol. The nationalities of the migrants were not immediately known.
Sunday's group was the biggest to arrive in Malta in a small boat since 61 made it to the island in April. 
The issue of how to handle migrants has split the European Union, although arrivals are down dramatically from their 2015 peak of more than a million.
More than 650,000 people have reached Italy's shores from North Africa since 2014 and Rome has begun to take a rigidly anti-immigration line, saying it will not let any more rescue ships dock unless other EU states agree to take the people.

Malta has also stopped letting rescue ships operated by voluntary organizations disembark unless other EU states agree to take some of the migrants aboard, but that move has boosted migrant arrivals via small boats.

Netanyahu made the announcement at a cabinet meeting, without citing a specific date for the talks with Putin.
Russia said on Tuesday it had upgraded Syria's air defences with the S-300 missile system, after accusing Israel of indirect responsibility for the downing of a Russian spy plane by Syrian forces as they fired on attacking Israeli jets last month. 
Israeli officials have said the new system could be defeated by Israel's stealth fighters and possibly destroyed on the ground, and they have pledged to press on with efforts to prevent military entrenchment by arch-enemy Iran in Syria.
But since the Russian plane was shot down, there have been no reports of Israeli air strikes in Syria.
The apparent pause has raised speculation in the Israeli media that Israel was either holding back at Russia's request or paused the attacks over concern they would fuel tensions with Moscow - the Damascus government's main military backer.
Netanyahu said he had spoken by telephone with Putin ""and we agreed to meet soon to continue the imporant security coordination between our armed forces"".

""Israel will constantly act to prevent Iran from entrenching itself militarily in Syria and transferring deadly weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon,"" he said, referring to the Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim group allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

RIGA (Reuters) - Dissatisfied Latvians rejected the right-of-center ruling coalition in Saturday's parliamentary election but suspicion of the left-leaning pro-Russia party makes it likely the next government will be another formation of ethnic Latvian parties to the right.
The result means a confirmation of the European Union and NATO member's role as a bulwark against Russia in the increasingly hostile relationship between the West and President Vladimir Putin.
Latvians, fed up with corruption and weak democracy in the Baltic country of 2 million, punished the ruling three-party coalition, which lost almost half of its votes, mostly to two newcomers. 
The populist KPV LV and anti-corruption New Conservatives won 14.1 and 13.6 percent respectively to become the second- and third-biggest parties.
""Our voters want a change from the old post-Soviet politics which has been very powerful up to now,"" said Janis Bordans, leader of the New Conservatives. ""They want to have a stable Latvia, but a one which doesn't stagnate.""
The New Conservatives, whose leadership features several former officers from the country's anti-corruption agency, want to beef up law enforcement and get rid of a number of current officials who they say are corrupt.
Bordans said he would like to be the new prime minister. 
""If we count out Harmony then it's logical that we take responsibility. We have to be ready to do it and it is very realistic,"" he said.
The pro-Russia party Harmony, which is supported by ethnic Russians who make up a quarter of the population, took 19.9 percent of the vote but will find it almost impossible to be part of any government.
The ethnic divide is strong in Latvian politics and other parties have always shut Harmony out of government. It has tried to rebrand itself as a Western-style social democratic party but severed official ties to Putin's United Russia party only last year.
""I don't think this is a norm-breaking election. It carries on the tradition we have seen in Latvia that a quarter of the seats go to the Russian-speaking party,"" said Daunis Auers, professor of comparative politics at the University of Latvia, adding that other parties would have no problem shutting out Harmony.
""Now they have no reason to form a government with Harmony. They can form a coalition among themselves,"" he told Reuters.
Before the election, some Latvians were concerned that a strong result for Harmony and the populist KPV could lead to their forming a government and bringing Latvia's foreign policy closer to Putin's Russia. 
The result will lead to a more fragmented parliament of seven parties, of which six won between 10 and 20 percent support each. The forming of a government coalition could take months.
Latvia has long been plagued by corruption and moneylaundering. The country's central bank governor is awaiting trial on charges of accepting a bribe and one of the biggest banks, ABLV, went into liquidation this year after U.S. authorities accused it of laundering vast amounts of money for people from the former Soviet Union. 
""The message that the voters have tried to send is that we're going to have some new faces in politics,"" Janis Ikstens, political scientist at Latvia University, told Reuters. ""And perhaps they’re not happy with the neglect of social needs.""

Harmony will get 24 seats and remain the biggest bloc. It is followed by the New Conservative Party with 16 seats, KPV LV with 15 seats, the National Alliance with 13 seats, Development/For with 13 seats, the Greens and Farmers Union with 11 seats and New Unity with eight seats.

The measures, which allow Iran to join a convention against the funding of terrorism (CFT), still have to be approved by a clerical body before they become law.
Tehran says it has been trying to implement international standards against money laundering and the funding of terrorism set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), but it has struggled to get the measures passed.
Hardliners in parliament have opposed legislation aimed at moving toward compliance with FATF standards, arguing it could hamper Iranian financial support for allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States has classified as a terrorist organization.
FATF has said Tehran has until October to complete the reforms or face consequences that could further deter investors from the country.
""The parliament faces a historic decision ... to act along the interests of the nation and take away any future excuses from the United States (to pressure Iran),"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told parliament before the vote, which was broadcast on state radio. 
Foreign businesses say legislation that includes FATF guidelines is essential if they are to increase investment.
In May, the United States pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Tehran and reimposed sanctions.
Washington has told countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures.

The assailant, the military said, had worked in a factory where the shooting took place.
Israel's national ambulance service said a man and two women were shot in the attack in the Barkan industrial area, where nearly 5,000 Palestinians are employed in Israeli-owned businesses.
A military spokesman, in a conference call with foreign journalists several hours after the incident, said the man and one of the women had died of their wounds.
The other woman shot in the incident was taken to hospital, where doctors said her injuries were not life-threatening.
""This was a serious terrorist attack,"" the military said in a statement. It identified the gunman as a 23-year-old Palestinian from a West Bank village and said he was still at large.
Surveillance camera footage broadcast on Israeli television showed a man armed with a rifle fleeing down stairs and running away from the factory.
Barkan industrial park is next to the settlement of Barkan and was established in the early 1980s.

Most countries consider settlements that Israel has built on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes this.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2018 03:25AM ET</span>","India’s Rohingya refugees struggle with hatred, fear as first group is expelled","By Krishna N. Das
JAMMU, India (Reuters) - Hours after Indian TV channels flashed that the country was deporting seven Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar, Sahidullah said he received a call from his nephew: ""Uncle, please get us out of here. They will send us back too.""
Sahidullah, a Rohingya living in the far north of India after fleeing what he called persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in 2010, said his relative, Sadiur Rahman, 40, was lodged in one of several detention centers for illegal immigrants in the distant northeastern state of Assam.
Rahman, he said, had been incarcerated with his brother and eight other relatives since being caught in 2012 at a railway station as they fled to India via Bangladesh. Sahidullah had taken the same route two years earlier, but like many others had escaped detection.
He said Rahman made the phone call when he was taken out for a routine medical checkup on Oct. 3, the day when India moved the seven Rohingya men out of a similar detention center and took them to the border.
They were handed to the Myanmar authorities the next day, the first ever such deportations of Rohingya here, spreading panic among an estimated 40,000 refugees who have fled to India from its neighbor.
About 16,500 of the refugees, including Sahidullah, have been issued identity cards by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that it says helps them ""prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation"".
India says it does not recognize the cards and has rejected the UN's stand that deporting the Rohingya violates the principle of refoulement – sending back refugees to a place where they face danger.
""Anyone who has entered the country without a valid legal permit is considered illegal,"" said A. Bharat Bhushan Babu, a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs. ""As per the law, anyone illegal will have to be sent back. As per law they will be repatriated.""
In recent days, Reuters interviewed dozens of Rohingya in two settlements, one in the northern city of Jammu and a smaller one in the capital, Delhi, and found communities who feel they are being increasingly vilified.
Many now fear Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government is about to act on its stated position – that it wants to deport all Rohingya Muslims from the country. With a general election due by next May, they worry that targeting them will be a populist tactic used by Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Addressing an election rally in the central state of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday, BJP chief Amit Shah said that all illegal immigrants were ""like termites eating into the nation's security"".
""Elect us back next year and the BJP will not allow a single one of them to stay in this country,"" Shah said, without specifically mentioning any group of migrants.
HATRED GROWING
Sahidullah – who like many Rohingya goes by only one name - is not just worried about his detained relatives but also his family living in a mainly Hindu region of India's only Muslim-dominated state, Jammu & Kashmir, in the country's northern tip.
The restive Himalayan state that borders Pakistan and is home to Muslim separatists battling Indian rule, has the biggest population of Rohingya in the country with around 7,000 people scattered in various makeshift settlements, largely in the Jammu region.
""We came to India because people told us things were better here, there's more work and one could move freely unlike back home,"" said Sahidullah, who works as a cleaner at a car showroom in Jammu city to support his aging amnesiac mother, wife and four children.
""All that's true and we are thankful to India for letting us live here. But hatred against us is growing,"" he told Reuters as he sat on a colorful linen sheet laid on the floor of his self-made wood and plastic-sheet house built on a rented plot of land.
Mohammed Arfaat, a 24-year-old Rohingya youth leader in Jammu, said that locals often accuse them of having links with militants without any proof.
""They want us out of here and that has got our families worried,"" said Arfaat, switching between English and Hindi as nearly a dozen community elders seated around him on the rough concrete floor of a Rohingya house started leaving for Friday prayers. ""Everybody here is aware of the deportation and is afraid.""
Indian authorities said that the repatriation of the seven was a routine procedure and that it sends all illegal foreigners back home.
But the UNHCR voiced deep concern on Friday about the safety and security of those expelled, saying they had been denied access to legal counsel and a chance to have their asylum claims assessed.
""Current conditions in Myanmar's Rakhine state are not conducive for safe, dignified and sustainable return of stateless Rohingya refugees,"" said UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic.
Most Rohingya used to live in Rakhine.
In August last year, attacks by Rohingya fighters on security posts in Rakhine led to a bloody military crackdown that caused around 700,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh.
The United Nations has accused Myanmar of acting against the Rohingya with ""genocidal intent,"" a charge Myanmar refutes, saying its military did not use excessive force and was reacting to militant attacks.
INCREASINGLY UGLY
The atmosphere facing the Rohingya in India has been getting increasingly ugly.
Jammu's Chamber of Commerce & Industry last year threatened to launch an ""identify and kill movement"" against the settlers, which it said pushed the government into taking the issue of Rohingya more seriously.
The chamber's president, Rakesh Gupta, told Reuters on Friday that there was nothing new in taking the law into one's hands if ""someone becomes a threat to our security, to the nation's security, and the security forces don't tackle them"".
In some of the more virulent parts of India’s media, the Rohingya are not only accused of being terrorists but also of trafficking in drugs and humans, and of having the money to elbow out local businesses.
The Pioneer newspaper, which supports the BJP, said in an editorial on Saturday that ""the Rohingya are a problem"", declaring that those that are radicalized Islamist extremists need to be dealt with ruthlessly and the rest are economic migrants that India cannot afford to help.
India, which considers itself a victim of Islamist militancy and is trying to boost economic ties with Myanmar to counter China, said late last year that it shared Myanmar's concern about ""extremist violence"" by Rohingya militants.
India's home ministry has told the Supreme Court that it had reports from security agencies and other authentic sources ""indicating linkages of some of the unauthorized Rohingya immigrants with Pakistan-based terror organizations and similar organizations operating in other countries"".
""It's definitely an election issue,” said Kavinder Gupta, a BJP legislator in Jammu & Kashmir and former deputy chief minister of the state.
""It's our decision to throw them out keeping in mind the security situation of the state,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of a campaign meeting for municipal elections. ""We have made the home ministry aware of the need to send them back to their country.""
Senior Jammu police officials said on condition of anonymity that they had identified all Rohingya in the area in preparation for their eventual deportation. They added they had not found any link of Rohingya with militants.
Around 600 km (370 miles) south of Jammu, residents of a makeshift refugee camp in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh also said they fear deportation.

""We don't want to leave India. Where will we go?"" said Mohammed Harun, a 47-year-old Rohingya elder in Delhi. ""There are refugees from other countries in India too. Why are we being targeted? Why do they send us to jail? It is only because we are Muslims. They don't do this to the other refugees.""

The Taliban set fire to a government building in Wardak's Sayeed Abad district and killed the district police chief along with nine other policemen on Saturday night, a senior police official said.
Repeated assaults on strategically important provinces, such as Wardak and nearby Ghazni, have been a show of strength for the Taliban, underscoring how volatile security remains in Afghanistan two weeks before nationwide parliamentary elections.
Abdul Rahman Mangal, a spokesman for the Wardak governor's office, said the Taliban raided some civilian houses after killing 10 policemen, destroyed newly built checkpoints and cut power to some parts of the city.
Government forces counter-attacked to stop the insurgents from approaching the city, Mangal said.
A statement from the Taliban's main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the insurgents had taken the center of Sayeed Abad and all surrounding security checkpoints, killing numerous members of the security forces and seizing weapons, ammunition and vehicles.
Mohammad Arif Noori, a spokesman for Ghazni's governor, said one soldier was killed by Taliban fighters as they tried to gain control over parts of the province nearly two months after being pushed back from the city by U.S.-backed Afghan forces.
The Taliban attacked Ghazni, a strategically important center straddling the main highway linking Kabul with Afghanistan's south, in August. It was the largest tactical operation launched by the Taliban since they overran the northern city of Kunduz in 2015.
That confrontation killed 150 members of Afghanistan's security forces and 95 civilians, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - An earthquake that struck off the northern coast of Haiti late on Saturday killed at least 11 people and injured more than a hundred when several buildings collapsed in the impoverished Caribbean country, officials said.
The magnitude 5.9 quake was centered about 12 miles (20 kms) west-northwest of the coastal town of Port-de-Paix, at a depth of 11.7 km, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.
The police chief for the northwest region, Jackson Hilaire, said at least seven people were killed and more than 100 injured in Port-de-Paix.
Another four people died in and around the town of Gros-Morne further south, including a boy struck by a falling building, said mayor Jean Renel Tide.
The tremor was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the capital, Port-au-Prince, in 2010, killing tens of thousands of people.
In a post on Twitter, President Jovenel Moise urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency reported the latest quake had caused outbreaks of panic in northern towns.
The agency said Port-de-Paix, Gros-Morne, the town of Chansolme and the island of Tortuga had suffered some of the worst damage. Some houses were destroyed, it said. 
Le Nouvelliste newspaper said one person was killed when an auditorium collapsed in Gros-Morne and that detainees were released from a police holding cell that was damaged.
The tremor also damaged the facade of a church in the town of Plaisance and a house next door collapsed, the paper said.
Saturday's quake was felt in Port-au-Prince but initial reports on Twitter said it had not caused major damage there.

JAKARTA/PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - When up to six-meter (20-foot) tsunami waves crashed into the Indonesian city of Palu last month, Didiek Wahyudi Kurniawan's house near the beach was quickly engulfed with water, leaving his wife and two daughters barely any time to escape. 
""I know there is supposed to be a tsunami warning alarm, but maybe it was outdated? I have no idea. We never get any warning from it,"" said Kurniawan, 46. 
He said he was out at the time but his family escaped by wading through chest-high water to a neighbor's three-storey building. 
While his family was spared, scores attending a beach festival in Palu were among those swept away, adding to the more than 1,600 deaths from the 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami that have been confirmed so far.
Other survivors also said they heard no sirens, even though a tsunami warning was issued and then lifted 34 minutes after the quake, based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, which is on Sulawesi island.
As Indonesia struggles with the aftermath of the devastating quake, the spotlight has again been shone on the apparent lack of preparedness in a sprawling archipelago that suffers regular tremors, lying on the seismically active so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. 
There was a major push in the region to improve warning systems after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 120,000 in Indonesia alone, including establishing a network of 22 warning buoys to detect tsunamis that was put in place with German and U.S. help.
International agencies and countries poured $4.6 billion into the reconstruction of Indonesia's devastated Aceh province on Sumatra island, with new infrastructure such as strategically placed evacuation centers. 
Still, with the first waves in Palu arriving within around four minutes and power and communications knocked out by the quake, text message alerts or sirens would probably not have been enough, even if they were working.
Denis McClean, a spokesman of the U.N. Disaster Risk Reduction agency, told a briefing only public awareness would have saved people under these circumstances.
""It happened very quickly. There wasn't much time for warnings to be disseminated, so it was very much dependent on the level of public awareness in order to save lives.""
""THE EARTHQUAKE IS THE WARNING""
Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said people still often did not know what to do when a disaster strikes.
Unlike in quake-prone countries like Japan and New Zealand, earthquake education and drills are conducted only sporadically in Indonesia. 
""The problem in tsunami early warning systems is not the structure, not its tools, but the culture in our communities,"" Nugroho told reporters.
Palu has some tsunami evacuation route signs, but Mokhtar, a resident, said while he was aware of government sponsored simulations shown on television on what to do in an earthquake, he had not seen any on the ground.
""There is a warning system but on that day there was none. No siren or anything,"" said the 51-year-old civil servant, adding that he has never heard the warning system ever.
Nugroho of the disaster agency said communities sometimes vandalize early warning tools like tsunami buoys.
The network of 22 buoys in Indonesia, which are connected to seabed sensors, have been inoperable since 2012, often due to neglect or vandalism.
Fishermen often used buoys to tie their boats, sometimes damaging sensors, while in one case a buoy was towed by fishermen from its original mooring to another part of the sea off Sulawesi. 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo called this week for the buoys to be repaired or replaced, but experts and officials say investment has also been neglected in other areas.
According to data from the disaster agency, out of about 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place.
Only about 3,100 km (1,920 miles) of evacuation routes have been established against a need for 11,900 km (7,390 miles), while there are only 50 evacuation shelters compared with estimates of 2,200 needed, the data showed.
The speaker of Indonesia's parliament, Bambang Soesatyo, pledged in a statement that at least in the case of buoys, parliament would support the budget for this.
Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said from evidence so far it appeared the tsunami in Palu was generated by a submarine landslide, something most warning systems would not pick up.
""The earthquake is the warning. The first thing you need to do is take cover in a safe space until the shaking stops and then get yourself away from the coast. It's about education,"" said Switzer, stressing that this needed ""to be ingrained in every child in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia"".
Even putting aside the human cost, there are powerful economic arguments for doing more to prepare for disasters.
Udrekh, a disaster expert at Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT), said Indonesia is discussing with Japan whether to invest in seabed cables with sensors that could detect tsunami and earthquakes, similar to a system in Japan. Such cables would be less vulnerable and quicker than buoys and cost 300 billion rupiah ($19.8 million) a year for every 200 km (125 miles), he said.
""We always say for disaster infrastructure that you save $7 for every $1 investment you make, so this is needed and the cost is nothing compared to other infrastructure,"" he said.
He estimated Indonesia lost about 30 trillion rupiah ($2 billion) each year from disasters, but spent too little on disaster mitigation infrastructure and education.
""It's like we never learned from 2004,"" he told Reuters.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2018 11:17PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Turkish police believe Saudi journalist Khashoggi was killed in consulate - sources,"By Orhan Coskun
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared four days ago after entering Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, was killed inside the consulate, two Turkish sources said on Saturday.
""The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" one of the two Turkish officials told Reuters.
The Turkish sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out. 
A Saudi source at the consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless.
The Saudi source said that a security team including Saudi investigators had arrived in Istanbul on Saturday to take part in the investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance.
Saudi Arabia's consul-general told Reuters earlier on Saturday that his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.
Khashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his criticism of Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documents for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside. He has not been heard of since.
Since then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.
The United States is seeking more information, a State Department official said.
""We are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,"" the official said.
A Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country.
The Turkish source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them. Turkey's Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate.
DEEPENING DIVISIONS
Khashoggi's disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said this week that the kingdom would allow Turkey to search the consulate for Khashoggi. But he also criticized Turkey's crackdown following a 2016 failed coup against Erdogan.
On Saturday, Yasin Aktay, Erdogan's AK Party adviser and a friend of Khashoggi, told Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera: ""We demand a convincing clarification from Saudi Arabia, and what the crown prince offered is not convincing.""
He also said what happened to Khashoggi was a crime and those responsible for his disappearance must be tried, Al Jazeera said.
Turkish prosecutors have begun an investigation into the case, officials said on Saturday, and a spokesman for Erdogan's AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.
""The condition of the lost journalist, details on him and who is responsible for this will be uncovered,"" Omer Celik said.
Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
Over the past year, he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post criticizing Saudi policies towards Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.
""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,"" Khashoggi wrote in September 2017. ""To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.""
Two months later, writing about the detentions of scores of Saudi royals, senior officials and businessmen accused of corruption, he said Mohammed bin Salman dispensed ""selective justice"" and said there was ""complete intolerance for even mild criticism"" of the crown prince.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by reports Khashoggi may have been killed inside the consulate.
""The Saudi authorities must immediately give a full and credible accounting of what happened to Khashoggi inside its diplomatic mission,"" CPJ said in a statement. 
On Saturday Saudi Arabia's consul-general in Istanbul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, opened up his mission to Reuters to show that Khashoggi was not on the premises, and said talk of his abduction was groundless. 
Opening cupboards, filing cabinets and wooden panels covering air conditioning units, Otaibi walked through the six floors of the building including a basement prayer room, offices, visa counters, kitchens and toilets as well as storage and security rooms.

He said the consulate was equipped with cameras but they did not record footage, so no images could be retrieved of Khashoggi entering or leaving the consulate, which is ringed by police barriers and has high security fences topped with barbed wire.

Pompeo posted a photograph of himself on Twitter on Sunday waving from the door of his U.S. government aircraft in Tokyo with the caption: ""Next stop #Pyongyang to meet with Chairman Kim and continue our work to fulfill the commitments made @potus and Chairman Kim at the #singaporesummit.""
Pompeo, who was making his fourth visit to Pyongyang, said on Twitter on Friday he would ""continue our efforts to build out a pathway for the denuclearization of (North Korea).""
An official of the State Department was not immediately able to confirm Pompeo's arrival in Pyongyang, from where outside communication can be limited. 
Pompeo visited Tokyo on Saturday and was expected in Seoul later on Sunday. He is also due to visit Beijing before returning to the United States on Monday.
Pompeo said en route to Asia he aimed ""to make sure we understand what each side is truly trying to achieve."" He said he also hoped to agree a ""general date and location"" for a second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim following their first meeting in June.
Kim pledged at his June 12 meeting with Trump in Singapore to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but his actions since have fallen short of Washington's demands for irreversible steps to give up its arsenal.
Pompeo declined en route to Asia to give details of his planned negotiations when asked if he would agree to North Korean demands for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War or to South Korea's suggestion that to break the current stalemate, he should avoid pressing again for an inventory of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Trump has appeared keen on a second summit with Kim, even though recent North Korean statements have suggested the two sides are far from narrowing their differences.
Recently, Pompeo has angered North Korea by insisting that international sanctions must remain in place until it gives up its nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, he said there was unanimous support for this at last week's U.N. General Assembly, even if Russia and China ""had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them."" 
Pompeo's last trip to North Korea did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July hailing progress, only for North Korea to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands."" Pompeo did not meet Kim on that trip.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations last month that continued sanctions were deepening the North's mistrust of the United States and there was no way Pyongyang would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.

In Tokyo, Pompeo met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and said he would coordinate closely with Japan over talks with North Korea and promised to raise the issue of the abductions of Japanese citizens in his meetings in Pyongyang.

KABUL (Reuters) - Najibullah, a 47 year-old shopkeeper in the main bazaar of Kabul's old city, is resisting the widespread pessimism and allegations of cheating that have hung over elections to Afghanistan's often-derided parliament this month.
The Oct. 20 vote, seen by international partners as a dry run for presidential elections next year, has been hampered by chaotic preparations, allegations of fraud and ever-present fears of militant violence. 
But Najibullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name, said it would be a chance to clean up the institution, a hope shared by foreign donors desperate for signs of progress 17 years since the Taliban were ousted.
""Fortunately there are talented, eligible and educated new faces among the candidates that can restore the image of parliament,"" Najibullah said.
The government and Afghanistan's international partners are counting on optimists like Najibullah to ensure the success of a ballot that is already three years overdue.
After a slow start, almost 9 million voters and 2,500 candidates competing for places in the 249-seat lower house have been registered and campaigning began officially late last month. Kabul's concrete blast walls have been plastered with election posters for hundreds of parliamentary hopefuls as well as sitting MPs standing for re-election. 
With Taliban insurgents controlling about one-third of the country, thousands being killed in the fighting and doubts about the success of the U.S. strategy to force the rebels to accept peace talks by stepping up air strikes, the credibility of the Western-backed government is at stake.
""We want to have timely and transparent elections. There is no secret about it,"" said European Union envoy Pierre Mayaudon. ""Both on their own merits - to strengthen institutions - and with a view to the next one, the presidential election.""
Despite some talk of a postponement, President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly insisted the elections will be held on time and both the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the government dismiss speculation of any delay.
""One hundred percent, the elections will take place on (Oct. 20),"" said IEC spokesman Syed Hafizullah Hashimi.
Preparations, however, have been anything but smooth.
Election authorities originally planned to have 7,355 polling centers across the country but only 5,100 will be able to open due to security concerns, according to the IEC. 
For weeks, media coverage has been dominated by reports of fraudulent voter registration and accusations of interference by powerful regional and local strongmen.
Instead of debating policy, most energy has been devoted to wrangling over issues like a new biometric voter verification system which political parties have insisted be introduced at the last minute.
The last of 22,000 handheld biometric verification devices only arrived in Kabul late last month and will be sent out to the provinces in the coming days but no one is sure the $20 million system can be set up by voting day.
TWO GENERATIONS
Samiullah Mahdi, a prominent television journalist running for parliament, admits the process is ""not much trusted"". But he sees the race as a chance to replace a discredited political class of power brokers and local bosses, many who have grown rich on contracts linked to the war.
""Sometimes I feel it's a struggle between two generations,"" he said. ""They have the money, the power, the guns and the political power but they think mainly about past glories and past grievances."" 
""If we have fair elections, people will be able to vote for a new generation that thinks of the future.""
Under the constitution, parliament reviews and ratifies laws but has little effective power and has become a byword for the rampant abuse that has put Afghanistan near the bottom of Transparency International's world corruption index.
According to a United Nations report from May, ""Afghanistan's legislature is part of the corruption problem and has for the most part avoided trying to be part of the solution."" Thieving parliamentarians are stock joke figures for social media commentators and television comedians.
""People are fed up, they want change,"" Mahdi said. ""Some think, 'Why do we need parliament?' but that's because we've had bad members of parliament.""
Thirty five candidates of the 2,500 have been barred from standing by the IEC because of suspected links to armed groups, or involvement in cases of murder, extortion or rape. Many more, who face similar accusations, remain on the list.
Nobody is expecting the election to be free of fraud or violence but if the vote does not take place before Afghanistan's harsh winter weather sets in, a nationwide ballot will be impossible until next year.
Persistent rumors in Kabul suggest that if the biometric system cannot be set up in time, a delay may be necessary. Foreign donors fear that if that happens, the credibility of Afghanistan's fledgling democratic institutions may be fatally undermined.

""Even though there will be limitations, it is better than a new postponement of the elections, so they must happen on that particular day,"" the EU's Mayaudon said.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Former Nigerian minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014, on Sunday announced that she will run for president next year. 
Ezekwesili, a former vice president for Africa at the World Bank, issued a statement announcing her intention to run. Nigeria's presidential election is scheduled to take place in February 2019. 
Ezekwesili, 55, served in Nigeria's government between 2000 and 2007, first as minerals minister and later education minister. 
President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in 2015, has been selected by the ruling party as its candidate. The main opposition People's Democratic Party plans to select his opponent at its convention on Sunday. 
""I want to run for, and win, the 2019 presidential election to serve and put the citizens first by mobilizing and taking decisive actions on a number of big ideas that will help all of us build an exceptional nation,"" Ezekwesili said in a statement.
Africa's most populous country, which is also the continent's top oil producer, emerged from recession early last year. But growth remains sluggish and inflation has remained high, above the central bank's single-digit target range. 
Ezekwesili's emailed statement made no reference to affiliations to a political party and did not provide details of specific policies she would support. She said she planned to tour the country. 
""Governance keeps worsening. So we the citizens have decided to get into the political arena to make things right,"" she said.
Ezekwesili, one of the founders of civil society organization Transparency International, was considered for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her anti-corruption work. 
She is known more recently for her work as co-founder of Bring Back Our Girls, a campaign which seeks to raise awareness about some 270 girls who were kidnapped from their school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 by Islamist group Boko Haram. 
The campaign brought international attention to the girls' plight. 
Many of the Chibok girls managed to escape in the hours following their abduction or were released in the last few years, including 82 who were released in an exchange deal that included several imprisoned Islamist insurgents. About 100 of the girls are still missing and their condition is unknown.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroonians head to the polls on Sunday in an election widely expected to extend the 36-year rule of President Paul Biya and confirm his place as one of Africa's last multi-decade leaders.
A victory for Biya, who has ruled since 1982, would usher in a seventh term for the 85-year-old and see him stay until at least the age of 92, bucking a tentative trend in Africa where many countries have installed presidential term limits. The only current African president to have ruled longer is Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
It would maintain a long held status quo in the oil and cocoa producing Central African country where, despite relative economic stability and growth of over 4 percent a year since Biya was last elected in 2011, many of its 24 million citizens live in deep poverty. Most have only known one president. 
Looming over the polls is a secessionist uprising in the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions that has cost hundreds of lives and forced thousands to flee either to the French-speaking regions or into neighboring Nigeria. Ghost towns remain, where the few who have stayed say they are afraid to go out and vote.
Some opposition parties have united in an effort to bolster support and harness discontent about the country's crumbling infrastructure and about Biya, who they say has ruled Cameroon like a personal fiefdom for too long. The president goes years without convening cabinet meetings and spends long stretches out of the country with his wife Chantal, most often holidaying in Switzerland. 
""There are many problems. There are no roads, no hospitals. We are poor. Biya must go,"" said 31-year-old businessman Emmanuel Bassong during an opposition rally in the capital Yaounde on Saturday. 
The odds, and history, are against the opposition, including the main candidate, Joshua Osih of the Social Democratic Front. In 2011, Biya won with 78 percent of the vote in an election that the United States state department described as ""flawed"" and ""marked by irregularities."" 
The African Union and other organizations are monitoring Sunday's vote, but opposition candidates have already complained of efforts to fix the election in Biya's favor. 
Biya's home advantage is clear across the hilly, green capital, where thousands of posters lining the roadside and draped down the side of high-rise buildings declare ""the force of experience"" of the incumbent. Tailors sell fabric bearing Biya's face that they make into dresses and suits seen all over town. 
Billboards advertising other candidates meanwhile are almost totally absent.
Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary on Saturday laughed off the idea of the opposition posing a threat to Biya. 
""The likelihood of his victory is beyond reasonable doubt. I am confident that the game is already done,"" he said.
Separatists have vowed to stop the polls from taking place in the English-speaking regions, home to 5 million people, about one-fifth of the population. Residents in those areas told Reuters that they would not vote anyway because of the insecurity. 
The crisis points to a central problem of Biya's rule: his long bid to centralize a hugely diverse population in a country founded in 1961 on the promise of federalism and autonomy for its regions. 
In 2016, Anglophone lawyers and teachers protested against the marginalization of minority English speakers in their professions. The government's heavy-handed clampdown, in which unarmed civilians were shot dead, radicalized many. Armed groups formed in the lush forests of the west. 
Biya did not visit the English-speaking regions during his campaign. 
Separatists have vowed to stop the polls from taking place on Sunday and have blocked the main highways. Spokesman Bakary said that the separatists were ""daydreaming"" if they thought they could stop the polls and that the government has put measures in place to ensure they go ahead. 
Military vehicles were stationed throughout the northwest town of Bamenda on Friday, residents said, and shops and banks are closed. 

""The streets are empty. I don't think I will go and vote,"" one local said. Since I started voting in 1997, the elections have not changed a thing.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Melania Trump concluded her trip to Africa on Saturday by voicing support for her husband's controversial Supreme Court pick and urging people to pay less attention to what she wears. 
The U.S. first lady said the message of her tour to Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt was to show the world that ""we care."" 
The stylish former model also said she did not always agree with her husband’s tweets and shared her opinions with him directly, even though he did not always follow her advice.
The four-country trip was a coming out of sorts for the U.S. first lady on the world stage. It was her first major solo trip abroad and a rare example of a time when she has answered questions by reporters on a variety of topics.
Speaking in Cairo on the tour's final leg, Trump praised her husband's Supreme Court choice, Brett Kavanaugh, and said she was glad he and his accuser had a chance to be heard following allegations of sexual assault prior to Saturday's Senate approval of his nomination.
""I’m glad that Dr. Ford was heard. I’m glad that Judge Kavanaugh was heard,"" Trump said, referring to psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her.
Trump declined to say whether she believed Ford.
""We need to help all the victims, no matter what kind of abuse they had,"" she said. ""I’m against any kind of abuse.""
The first lady rarely talks to reporters, and she chose a historic site to do so, near the Great Sphinx. 
Asked about her wardrobe choices, the first lady lamented the fact that her clothes drew more attention than her work on children's issues.
“I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,” she said, before posing for pictures in front of some of Egypt's greatest landmarks.
Trump drew some criticism for wearing a white pith helmet during a safari in Kenya because of its association with the exploitation of Africans. That type of hat was favored by 19th century European colonialists.
It was not the first time her clothing choices have sparked controversy.
The first lady spurred outrage earlier this year when she wore a jacket bearing the words “I really don’t care, do u?” during a trip to a Texas shelter that housed migrant children separated from their parents. 
CONTROVERSY DISMISSED 
Trump flew to Cairo from Nairobi earlier on Saturday on the last stage of her visit to Africa. President Trump has been quoted as saying immigrants from Africa came from ""shit-hole countries,"" though he has denied making the remark.
""Nobody discussed that with me (during the trip), and I never heard him saying those comments. And that was anonymous source and I would leave it at that,"" she said.
The first lady said she did not always agree with her husband's tweets and shared her opinions with him. He listened sometimes, and sometimes did not, she said.
“I give him my honest opinion and honest advice,"" she said. ""I have my own voice and my opinions, and it’s very important for me that I ... express what I feel.”
Trump received a warm welcome from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his wife, Entissar, at the presidential palace in Cairo before she headed to visit the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx.
She wore slacks and a tie as she stepped off the plane in Cairo, where she proceeded to the presidential palace, an ornate cream stone building with arabesque designs.
Trump made a brief stop at the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy in downtown Cairo, driving through streets nearly deserted because of a national holiday marking the 45th anniversary of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.
Trump has focused on her signature issue of campaigning for children with stops at a hospital, primary school and an orphanage.

Speaking near the Sphinx, Trump said that the message of her trip has been to show ""that we care. And we want to show the world that we care.""

The town of Azaz lies in a part of northern Syria that Turkey's army helped rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad to capture in 2016. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the explosion happened in an industrial area of Azaz. 
The number of dead is likely to rise, it said, because other people were seriously injured. 
In recent weeks there have been a number of blasts in the parts of north-west Syria along the border where Turkey trains and pays for a unified armed force of Syrian rebels.
Northern Syria has become a haven for large numbers of displaced people who have sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in the country, or who do not want to live under Assad.

""The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr. Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" one Turkish official told Reuters.
The sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out. Saudi Arabia's consul-general told Reuters on Saturday his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.
Khashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his critical views on Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documentation for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside. He has not been heard of since.
Since then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.
Earlier on Saturday Turkish officials said prosecutors had begun investigating Khashoggi's disappearance and a spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's consul in Istanbul opened up his mission on Saturday in an effort to show that prominent Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, who vanished four days ago, was not on the premises and said that talk of his kidnapping was baseless.
Reuters journalists toured the six-storey consulate in northern Istanbul which Khashoggi entered on Tuesday to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. His fiancee, who had waited outside, said he never came out. 
Turkish officials have said they believe he remains inside the consulate, and Ankara said on Saturday prosecutors had begun an investigation into his disappearance. Saudi Arabia says he left the consulate on Tuesday after completing his paperwork.
""I would like to confirm that...Jamal is not at the consulate nor in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the consulate and the embassy are working to search for him,"" consul-general Mohammad al-Otaibi said in an interview at the consulate. 
""We are worried about this case.""
Khashoggi had lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year, saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Saudi policies including the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent in which dozens of people have been detained. 
Human rights groups have called on Saudi Arabia to verify his whereabouts. Human Rights Watch said if Saudi Arabia had detained Khashoggi without acknowledging it, his detention would constitute an enforced disappearance.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg earlier this week that Saudi authorities would allow Turkey to search the consulate, but Turkish officials have not yet entered the premises. 
Otaibi said there were no legal charges against Khashoggi at the consulate, and he gave a tour of the building to Reuters to demonstrate that the missing journalist was not on the premises.
NO CAMERA FOOTAGE 
Opening cupboards, filing cabinets and wooden panels covering air conditioning units, Otaibi walked through the six floors of the building including a basement prayer room, offices, visa counters, kitchens and toilets as well as storage and security rooms.
He said the consulate was equipped with cameras but they did not record footage, so no images could be retrieved of Khashoggi entering or leaving the consulate, which is ringed by police barriers and has high security fences topped with barbed wire.
The building has two entrances at the front and back, and Otaibi said Khashoggi could have left from either side. 
""If those who say he was kidnapped are focusing on his being in the mission, these are just rumors that have no proof,"" he said. ""And we unfortunately regret some of the statements that have been made by Turkish officials who insist that (Khashoggi is) in the consulate ... without it being built on facts."" 
The spokesman for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party vowed that authorities would uncover the whereabouts of Khashoggi and the details of his disappearance, saying the case was highly sensitive for Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha. 
Otaibi said authorities in the two countries were in contact. ""Let us leave some time and a chance for both sides to see results"".
The idea that Khashoggi may have been abducted at the consulate was ""disgusting"", he said. ""The idea of kidnapping a Saudi citizen by a diplomatic mission is something that should not be put forward in the media.""
Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.

Over the past year he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post, criticizing Saudi policies toward Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.

Relatives of the Tuam babies say more should be done to recover and identify the infants' remains and to determine how they died.
At the head of the cortege was Peter Mulryan, a man in his seventies who lived in the home until he was four and believes that his sister may lie buried among the bones of babies and toddlers found in a disused septic tank in the grounds.
An official inquiry said in 2017 that there were ""significant quantities"" of remains at the site, which were dated to the period when the mother and baby home operated.
According to researchers who compared the number of death certificates issued to recorded burials, almost 800 children could be interred in the grounds. 
""I've a sister in that septic tank in Tuam and I want her, and the rest, out of there for a proper DNA test and to be handed back to their siblings,"" said Mulryan.
""We want to give them the proper Christian burial they were denied.""
The discovery of the unmarked graves horrified Ireland, reviving anguish over how women and children were once treated at state-backed Catholic institutions.
The infant mortality rate at Church-run institutions was significantly higher than in wider Irish society, with death certificates mostly blaming infections like measles, gastroenteritis, bronchitis, tuberculosis, meningitis and pneumonia.
Addressing the gathering on Dublin's O'Connell Street, Kevin Higgins, a lawyer who has acted on Peter Mulryan's behalf, called for an inquest and post-mortems to determine how the children in the Tuam home died.
""The government has set its face against a inquest into the cause of death of each individual child. They do not want the truth to emerge. From those remains, there will be evidence, even now, of maltreatment and neglect.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has ordered a ""thorough study"" of all documents in Holy See offices concerning disgraced former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Vatican said on Saturday in its first response to accusations that have shaken the Catholic Church.
In a statement, the Vatican appeared to be committing itself to examine the paper trail on the McCarrick case, quoting from speech Francis made in 2015 in which he said ""We will follow the path of truth wherever it may lead"".
The latest crisis began in August when Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican's former ambassador to the United States, said in a bombshell document that the pope knew for years about sexual misconduct by McCarrick with adult male seminarians but did nothing about it.
Vigano accused a long list of current and past Vatican and U.S. Church officials of covering up for 88-year-old McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., and called on the pope to resign.
The letter, combined with a recent spate of sexual abuse crises in several countries, has thrown the Catholic Church into turmoil.
In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in nearly 100 years after American Church officials said allegations made in a separate investigation that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated..
That investigation was not directly related to the accusations that McCarrick, who rose to be a key power broker in the American Church, had engaged in sexual misconduct with adult males for years.
CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION
American Church leaders have called for the Vatican to launch an investigation, known as an ""apostolic visitation,"" into how McCarrick could have risen steadily through the ranks of the U.S. Church although many people knew about his alleged misconduct with adults.
Saturday's Vatican statement appeared to be a partial response to the U.S. bishops' request for an investigation as well as to Vigano's demands that the Vatican release documents in its archives related to McCarrick.
It said information already known about McCarrick in the United States would be combined with a ""a further thorough study of the entire documentation"" in Vatican archives ""in order to ascertain all the relevant facts, to place them in their historical context and to evaluate them objectively.""
But the Vatican statement also appeared to suggest that wrong decisions and mistakes may have been made regarding McCarrick in the past.
""The Holy See is conscious that, from the examination of the facts and of the circumstances, it may emerge that choices were taken that would not be consonant with a contemporary approach to such issues,"" the statement said, without elaborating.
Vigano alleged that former Pope Benedict, who resigned in 2013, had placed sanctions on McCarrick because of his sexual misconduct with adult males and had ordered him to retire to a life of prayer and penitence and refrain from public ministry.
Vigano claimed that Francis had lifted the sanctions, effectively rehabilitating McCarrick.
But Vatican officials pointed out that McCarrick continued to lead a public life even during Benedict's papacy while he was supposedly under sanctions, traveling many times to the Vatican and meeting Benedict himself.
Last week, Benedict's doctrinal chief, Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, said he knew nothing about any formal or informal sanctions against McCarrick.

McCarrick has said he had no recollection of alleged abuse of the minor, but has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the seminarians, which allegedly took place mostly at a beach house in New Jersey when he was a bishop in that state.

Sanaa residents told Reuters dozens were arrested, including 16 female students. 
The students were released at the end of the day after signing a pledge not to take part in demonstrations again, one of them said, asking not to be identified for fear of retribution.
She said female Houthi supporters ""attacked us with electric shock batons and clubs, supported by armed men"".
""They beat me until I fell to the ground and I received an electric shock in the back when I stood up again. I wasn't able to move when they took me to the police station,"" she said. 
The Iran-aligned Houthis took control of Sanaa in 2014, ousting the internationally-recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. A Saudi-led U.S.-backed international military coalition intervened in 2015 to restore it. 
""Security services in the capital detained a number of mercenaries tasked by the aggressors to plant rumours and disturb public peace,"" the Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said.
Both sides of the Yemen conflict have been accused of serious human rights violations. 
Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries, on which many depend, as foreign exchange reserves dwindle.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Merkel calls for end to conservative in-fighting to halt poll slide,"By Andreas Rinke
KIEL, Germany (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that the conservatives must end their in-fighting to reverse slides in the polls before two regional elections this month.
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party have struggled to maintain a united front on immigration policy and the fate of the scandal-hit domestic intelligence agency.
Polls indicate the CSU will lose its absolute majority in the Bavarian parliament in an election in the southern state on Oct. 14, bleeding support to the ecologist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Support for Merkel's CDU is also projected to fall, to around 29 percent, in an election in the state of Hesse two weeks later. The party won 10 percentage points more in the election five years ago in Hesse, where it governs with the Greens.
""I know that through our dispute we have contributed to making the polls look as they do,"" Merkel told the CDU/CSU youth wing in a speech in the northern city of Kiel. ""Voters don't appreciate it if we argue and they don't even understand what we're arguing about.""
Merkel's authority has been waning since an inconclusive election in September last year that produced the worst result for her conservatives since 1949.
Her first attempt to form a government with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) was unsuccessful, forcing her to turn to the center-left SPD to secure a fourth term.
She had to make painful concessions to the SPD, including ceding the prized finance ministry, to get the party to reverse its decision to be in opposition and join the government as coalition partners.
She has since faced calls from her own party to name a successor.
The CDU/CSU youth wing on Saturday demanded a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms that a chancellor can serve to three.
Merkel rejected this idea, saying it would breach the constitutional rights of lawmakers to have the freedom to vote for any chancellor candidate they want.
SEEHOFER TO STAY ON
Merkel's coalition has been lurching from one crisis to another.
In the summer, CSU leader and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer brought the government to the brink of collapse with a threat to turn back migrants at the border with Austria if they had already applied for asylum elsewhere in the European Union.
Seehofer's hardline on immigration has not helped his to CSU reverse a slide in support in Bavaria, the main gateway for migrants coming to Germany.
Voters in the wealthy state appear to be unimpressed with his anti-immigration rhetoric.
Those opposed to Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to some one million, mainly Muslim asylum seekers, are turning to the AfD.

Dressed in traditional black garb and white hats, the small crowd chanted and shouted into megaphones, pledging loyalty to Assad, while Syrian soldiers, hundreds of meters away, across a security fence and on the opposite side of a valley, yelled back in support.
The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam and whose adherents in Syria have long been loyal to the ruling Assad family.
Emil Masoud, 38, who lives in the village of Massade, said they gathered to ""celebrate the final stages of the war ... and to celebrate with our people in Syria the final stage of victory.""
Israel has largely stayed on the sidelines of Syria's seven-year civil war.
The border itself has been mostly calm, with occasional stray fire from Syria or brief exchanges, though heavy fighting could be easily heard and seen in the distance.
Israeli Druze, some of whom have influence in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the military, have at times urged Israel to intervene across the frontier, where hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed and millions driven from their homes during the civil war.
The Golan was part of Syria until Israel captured it in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the territory in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally.

Once willing to consider returning the Golan for peace with Syria, the Israelis have in recent years argued that the war in Syria and the presence there of an Iranian garrison backing Damascus show they need to keep the strategic plateau.

In the five months since the parliamentary election, there has been no sign of the concessions sought by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri that would enable the formation of a unity government that can get to work on badly needed economic reforms. Politicians are warning that Lebanon faces an economic crisis. 
The main sticking point in negotiations has been seen as how to satisfy the competing demands of Maronite Christian President Michel Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) on the one hand, and their Maronite rival Samir Geagea and his Lebanese Forces party on the other.
On Friday the Christian parties clashed over how power should be divided in the government, casting doubt over Hariri's prediction on Thursday that an agreement would be reached soon.

""We have gone back to zero,"" Berri told Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar. ""There had been signs of a resolution, but after yesterday's statements I have become pessimistic.""

On Wednesday, eight Turkish soldiers were killed and two were wounded after a roadside bomb in the southeastern province of Batman was detonated by outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants.
Speaking to members of his ruling AK Party at the start of a two-day summit in the outskirts of Ankara, Erdogan said the PKK would pay the price for the eight soldiers.
""Do we have eight martyrs? Then let those terrorists know that they will pay the price for this with at least 800,"" he said. ""We will finish them by going into their dens, their holes. We will end them in Sinjar and in Qandil.""
The comments marked Erdogan's strongest warning of a potential offensive against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq in recent weeks.
Turkey has in recent months carried out strikes on PKK bases in northern Iraq, especially its stronghold in the Qandil mountains, but warnings of a ground offensive into the area had largely died down following the June elections.
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union, has waged an insurgency against the state since Turkish the 1980s. 
Violence in the largely Kurdish southeast has worsened since the collapse of a ceasefire in 2015 and the government has carried out widespread operations to capture the militants in Turkey as well.

Over the past two days, Turkish authorities have detained 137 people over suspected links to the PKK in operations across the nation, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday.

TIKRIT/FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and 14 wounded when a bus carrying workers at a small oil refinery in northern Iraq was blown up by an improvised explosive device, police said.
The bus was at the Siniya refinery, near Iraq's largest oil refinery of Baiji in the predominantly Sunni Salahuddin province, when it exploded, Baiji police said on Saturday.
Separately, three civilians and a policeman were injured when a parked car exploded in a market area in Falluja within the western, also Sunni, Anbar province, security sources said.
No group has claimed responsibility for either attack, but Islamic State militants are active in both provinces.
Iraqi forces declared victory over the hardline Sunni Islamist group in December after retaking all the territory it held in a four year war, but its fighters are waging a guerrilla-style insurgency.
Security sources said the attack in Falluja was the first since Iraqi forces retook the city from the militants in 2016. 
It came only after Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella network of mostly Shi'ite militias, started operating within the city, residents and tribal leaders said.
PMF forces have long been stationed at checkpoints around the city and in the entire province but had not entered the city proper before.

According to the latest polls the ruling coalition of the Union of Greens and Farmers, the National Alliance and the Unity party looks to be well short of forming a majority government.
Ethnic Latvian parties have resolutely kept the pro-Russia Harmony party from power in the former Soviet republic as they sought ever closer ties with the West.
But dissatisfaction with Latvian politicians, widely seen as corrupt and inefficient, has seen the government parties lose voters to KPV LV, a populist party that has promised a fresh and more efficient government. [nL8N1WL3LB]
Its leader, Artuss Kaimins, whose popularity has soared as he railed against corrupt politicians, has sent mixed messages on whether he would rule out a deal with Harmony, set to be the biggest party due to its support base among the Russian-speaking minority.
""I will be one of those good people who elect bad politicians,"" said Raivis, a man in his late thirties, before casting his vote for Harmony in a Riga suburb.
""I try not to think about it because it's been so complicated that it's hard to understand who's playing the chess board."" 
Latvia, a member of the European Union and NATO, shares a 276-kilometre (167 miles) border with Russia which makes it a frontline state in the increasingly hostile relationship between the West and President Vladimir Putin.
NATO currently has more than 1,000 troops deployed in the Baltic country of 2 million and even the potential of a minor shift in allegiance in Latvia will worry both Brussels and Washington. 
Harmony wants to remain in the EU and NATO but have closer economic ties with Russia and only canceled a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party last year.
With Russian speakers making up a quarter of the population, Harmony looks to remain the biggest party, according to the polls, followed by the Union of Greens and Farmers and KPV LV.

Polling stations close at 1700 GMT with a preliminary official result expected around 0100 GMT Sunday morning.

Sporadic clashes erupted between Afghan soldiers and Taliban insurgents who were trying to gain control over parts of Ghazni province nearly two months after being pushed back from the city by U.S.-backed Afghan forces, officials added.
Mohammad Arif Noori, the governor’s spokesman in Ghazni, said fighting was ongoing and the Afghan army had deployed helicopters to prevent the militants from entering the city center.
""We are fully prepared to attack them. This time the province will not fall into the hands of the Taliban,"" Noori said.
Five militants were killed as they were planting bombs on three bridges on the Kabul-Kandahar highway, Noori added. 
Residents of Qarabagh district, 55 km (35 miles) south of Ghazni city, said the militants had set up checkpoints and did not allow vehicles to pass through several residential areas.
The attack on Ghazni was a show of strength for the Taliban, underscoring how volatile the security situation remains two weeks before the parliamentary elections.
Polling has already been called off in Ghazni province after the Taliban overran it in August and besieged the city for five days. 
That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians dead, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, said officials then.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - More than a week after a major earthquake hit the west coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi island, rescuers workers were focusing on Saturday on what looks sure to be a long, difficult search for bodies, many buried in appalling morasses of debris and mud.
President Joko Widodo has said all of the victims of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that struck on Sept. 28 must be found.
The official death toll from the quake and the tsunami it triggered has risen to 1,649, but will certainly increase.
Most of the dead have been found in the region's main urban center, the small city of Palu. Figures for more remote areas, some just re-connected to the outside world by road, are trickling in.
No one knows how many people were dragged to their deaths when the quake triggered soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that turns the ground into a roiling quagmire. Communities in the south of Palu were particularly hard hit.
The national disaster agency says 1,700 homes in one neighborhood alone were swallowed up. Many hundreds of people are now entombed in slowly drying mud churned with heaps of debris and vehicles.
In the Balaroa neighborhood of Palu, rescuers found 34 bodies on Saturday, and laid them out in a row of blue and orange bags, among them 10-year-old Dede Aulianisa.
Her parents recognized her from the clothes she was wearing when the quake struck.
""I'm certain it's her. She was wearing the exact scout uniform, with a sweater with the words 'Geng 97',"" her father, Anwar, who like many Indonesian goes by only one name, told Reuters.
""When the land split, she happened to be on the side that collapsed,"" he said. ""She was such a happy child. Very intelligent. Her teachers loved her and she had many friends.""
The most intact structure in the area was a battered two-storey house, pitched over at nearly 45 degrees with one side buried and a blue vehicle in the car port.
In the Petobo neighborhood nearby, a team of French rescue experts began hunting through an expanse of debris, looking for hands, feet or any body parts of victims sticking out of the mud.
Arnaud Allibert and four other members of the group Pompiers Humanitaires Francais were the first rescuers to venture into that area.
The team will scour the debris and find and retrieve bodies at the surface, to clear the way for excavators to dig deeper.
""If we see body parts sticking out, we're going to dig to get the body out ... It's a long-term job, but after that, they'll come with the heavy machinery,"" Allibert told Reuters.
Graphic: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo
'FIVE MONTHS' 
Allibert said it would take a long time to find all the bodies.
""It might take 4 to 5 months to remove all the soil, and that's with the excavators,"" he said. ""The excavators can't take huge amounts of soil because there are bodies underneath, you have to scrape the earth carefully.""
Traumatized survivors are desperate for help.
""There are so many corpses around here,"" said Irwan, 37, a resident of Petobo, standing amidst the ruins.
""So many are gone,"" he said, reeling off a list of his missing relatives including a sister, an aunt and cousins.
Amidst the shock and grief, some better news emerged.
The lives of many villagers at the epicenter of a quake were spared because they had been terrified by a smaller tremor that hit earlier and had run outside.
A coastal strip dotted with villages north of Palu was cut off for nearly a week by landslides blocking its single road. But the way is now open and aid is trickling in to the area that rescue workers feared had been obliterated.
While destruction is extensive, with many houses destroyed, villagers said countless lives were saved by a 6.1 magnitude quake that struck about 20 km (12 miles) to the south three hours earlier.
""Luckily most people were already outside,"" said Rahman Lakuaci, chief of Lende Tovea village in Sirenja district.
Authorities have yet to conduct a tally of casualties in districts near the epicenter, but Lakuaci estimated dozens of people had been killed.
Indonesia has traditionally been reluctant to be seen as relying on outside help to cope with disasters, and the government shunned foreign aid this year when earthquakes struck the island of Lombok. 
But it has accepted help from abroad for the disaster in Sulawesi.
Despite that, Allibert said it had been difficult to get permits for Sulawesi.
Michael Lesmeister, director of Germany's ISAR-Germany rescue group, said landing permits for his staff and cargo had come through and, after a three-day wait, they were set to install a water-purification system in Palu.
Deputy Foreign Minister Abdurrahman Mohammad Fachir told a briefing in Jakarta ministries were coordinating to facilitate the arrival of aid.

STRBSKE PLESO, Slovakia (Reuters) - Slovakia must produce deeds not words to stamp out corruption and mafia-style crime, the prime minister said, after the murder of a journalist investigating EU subsidy fraud rattled the nation and prompted the resignation of his predecessor.
Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said the killing in February of 27-year-old reporter Jan Kuciak, who was found shot dead at his home along with his fiancee, had tarnished Slovakia's image.
Kuciak brought attention to Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links and their alleged subsidy fraud in eastern Slovakia.
Pellegrini said his cabinet had initiated legislation to strengthen the independence of the police chief to tackle corruption. He said his government was looking at new systems to prevent subsidy fraud.
""We will not tolerate any mafia in Slovakia. Not in the field of (agricultural) subsidies, not in the field of EU funds. We will apply a zero-tolerance policy,"" he said.
""We have to produce deeds, not words to restore trust in this government among those people who have lost it,"" Pellegrini said.
After almost a decade-and-a-half in the European Union, Slovakia has seen living standards jump among its 5.4 million people, thanks to strong economic growth driven by automotive production.
But many people complain about perceived public corruption often involving well-connected businesspeople.
Kuciak's murder led to massive nationwide protests against corruption and the government, prompting the resignation of longtime prime minister Robert Fico. However, his government coalition remains intact, led by his former deputy Pellegrini.
Police made their first arrests in the case after raids last week, but prosecutors have yet to detail motives in the killing.
""The arrests of the (suspected) murderers are not the end of the investigation,"" Pellegrini said on Friday on the sidelines of the Globsec Tatra Summit at a Slovak mountain resort.
""The only catharsis will be to identify who ordered the murder, convict him or her and deliver a fair verdict,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
Slovakia is a member of the Visegrad group of central European countries - along with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland - that have battled with the EU executive over migration policy in recent years. 
Their opposition to Brussels-imposed quotas to re-distribute asylum seekers led to the plan being dropped.
But Pellegrini said the Visegrad group, whose members are among the EU's fastest economic growth engines, should not be labeled ""troublemakers"" and disputes should be resolved through dialogue. 
Hungary and Poland have been under the threat of facing the bloc's punitive Article 7 procedure over rule of law concerns that could eventually strip them of voting rights.
""I strongly believe... that dialogue will lead to concessions on both sides that will result in an agreement, avoiding the vote and activation of Article 7 that bans a member state from voting... That would be very bad,"" he said.

Hundreds of fishmongers are packing up and preparing to leave Tsukiji for a gleaming new $5 billion market set to open on Thursday on reclaimed land farther from central Tokyo.
The most expensive fish - a 162-kg (357.15 lb) tuna - sold for 4.3 million yen ($37,818) at the early morning auction, Kyodo News said. Business at Tsukiji officially ended at noon.
""I am very grateful and happy that we could have continued business smoothly all these years until today. I would like to thank Tsukiji from the bottom of my heart,"" Hiroyasu Itoh, chairman of the seafood wholesalers' association, told reporters.
The 83-year-old Tsukiji market drew tens of thousands of visitors a year to its warren of stalls with exotic species of fish and fresh sushi. But it had become dilapidated and unsanitary, city officials said in planning the move to a new site in Toyosu, a man-made island in Tokyo Bay.
A survey taken by a group opposed to the relocation found that more than 80 percent of Tsukiji fish traders were against the move to Toyosu.
Takeshi Ohashi, a 44-year-old former Tsukiji worker, went to the market with his wife to bid farewell. 
""I am sad to see Tsukiji close but I do look forward to seeing what the land will be used for after this and how Tokyo will develop going forward,"" Ohashi said.
The old Tsukiji site will provide temporary parking for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and eventually become a tourist center.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif was ordered jailed on Saturday for 10 days after being arrested in a corruption case, his lawyer said, meaning he will not be able to campaign for his party ahead of crucial by-elections next week.
Sharif is the younger brother of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison by an anti-corruption court after the Supreme Court removed him from power. 
Friday's arrest of Shehbaz Sharif by agents of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in Lahore involved a case of alleged corruption in a low-cost housing scheme when Sharif was chief minister of Punjab province.
A NAB court on Saturday heard charges that Sharif in 2014 illegally canceled a contract with a construction company and sought to award it to another company, allegedly for a bribe.
The court ordered him remanded in custody for 10 days to be interrogated, his lawyer Azam Nazir Tarar said.
Hundreds of activists from Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz gathered outside the court, chanting pro-Sharif slogans as police and army Rangers guarded the venue.
Sharif denies any wrongdoing, and his brother has denounced corruption cases against him and other party leaders as politically motivated. 
Lawyer Tarar said that Sharif was improperly arrested on a warrant that was kept secret. Sharif went to the court for questioning in another corruption case involving a water purification scheme but instead was arrested on the housing project warrant.
""They cannot arrest the leader of the opposition in this manner,"" the lawyer said.
Ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was arrested 10 days before the July 25 general election, which was won by cricket star turned politician Imran Khan, who now leads the new government. He was released from prison last month pending an appeal.
The Sharifs' Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz came in second place in the general election. Their party denounced the polls as rigged, alleging the military and courts tipped the scale in favor of Khan's party, a charge the army and judiciary deny.
The PML-N says that the arrest of Shehbaz Sharif was intended to weaken the party before by-elections to be held on Oct. 14.
The by-elections are for 11 parliamentary seats and 19 provincial assembly seats.
The voting could affect the slim majority Khan's coalition government holds in parliament, though many of the constituencies are considered strongholds of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. 

The contests are considered to be closer in the provincial assemblies and could result in the PML-N winning back control of Punjab.

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he would coordinate closely with Japan during denuclearization talks with North Korea and promised to raise the issue of the abductions of Japanese citizens in his meetings in Pyongyang. 
""We will have a fully coordinated, unified view of how to proceed, which will be what is needed if it is going to be successful in denuclearizing North Korea,"" Pompeo told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. ""We will bring up the issue of the abductees as well,"" he said. 
Abe thanked Pompeo, who arrived in Tokyo on Saturday, for coming to Japan before he meets North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Sunday.
Pompeo also said Japan and the United States were in a position to finalize a trade agreement after Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the issue in New York last month.
The two sides have agreed to start trade talks in an arrangement that, for now, protects Japanese automakers from further tariffs, seen as a major threat to the export-dependent economy. Trump is unhappy with Japan’s $69 billion trade surplus with the United States - nearly two-thirds of it from auto exports - and wants a bilateral agreement to address it.
Despite Kim's pledge to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, Japan, Washington's key ally in Asia, still considers North Korea to be a ""dire threat,"" and is pushing ahead with plans to bolster its ballistic missile defenses with Aegis Ashore batteries that can target warheads in space.
Tokyo also insists that North Korea give a full accounting of Japanese citizens it abducted to train as spies and return any who are still alive before it agrees to normalize ties. A restoration of ties could lead to Japan releasing what could be billions of dollars of war reparations and economic assistance to its impoverished neighbor.
Pompeo will travel to Seoul after leaving Pyongyang and will head to Beijing before returning to the United States on Monday.
Speaking to a pool reporter en route to Tokyo, Pompeo said his aim in Pyongyang was ""to make sure we understand what each side is truly trying to achieve."" He also said he hoped to be able to agree a ""general date and location"" for a second summit between Trump and Kim following their first meeting in Singapore in June.
Pompeo's last visit to North Korea failed to make progress with Pyongyang denouncing him for making ""gangster-like demands.""
Recently, he angered North Korea by insisting that international sanctions must remain in place until it gives up its nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, he said there was unanimous support for this at last week's U.N. General Assembly, even if Russia and China ""had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them.""

He declined to say if he would agree to North Korea's demand for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War or to South Korea's suggestion that he avoid pressing again for an inventory of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons to break the stalemate.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanians began voting on Saturday on whether to change the constitution to comprehensively ban same sex marriage in a two-day referendum that rights activists say has stirred hate speech against LGBT people.
The conservative state is already one of the only EU members to bar marriage or civil partnerships for same sex couples. 
But supporters of the proposal, including the Orthodox Church and all but one parliamentary party, say they want to go further and change the constitutional definition of marriage from a union of ""spouses"", to one exclusively of a man and a woman to stop gay couples winning the right to marry in the future.
Dozens of human rights groups, which are encouraging people to boycott the ballot, have warned that approval would embolden further attempts to chip away at the rights of minority groups and push Romania onto a populist, authoritarian track.
A poll released on Friday by CURS estimated a turnout of 34 percent - above the needed 30 percent threshold - with 90 percent in favor of the change. 
A group called the Coalition for the Family collected 3 million signatures to enable the change. The lower house of parliament voted in favor last year and the senate followed in September, making the referendum the last needed stage. 
Some Coalition campaign posters urged people to vote ""Yes"" to defend family values or run the risk of gay couples stealing or adopting their children. A separate advert said a ""No"" vote would enable a man to marry a tree.
""Many fear that what has happened in other countries, such as legalizing marriage between a man and an animal, could happen here,"" the leader of the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD), Liviu Dragnea, told television station Romania TV.
LOOSE CONTROLS
Days before the vote, the government relaxed anti-fraud monitoring and limited options for challenging the result, while the country's broadcasting regulator eliminated a cut-off date for campaigning.
""There are ... no efficient, applicable mechanisms to verify fraud for this referendum,"" independent think tank Expert Forum (EFOR) said, adding the conditions have created ""a climate of distrust in the fairness of the process"". 
Some opposition politicians and activists have accused the PSD of using the vote as a smokescreen to divert attention from its leader's legal problems, and its clashes with the European Commission over the rule of law.
Dragnea's appeal against a conviction in an abuse of office case begins on Oct. 8, one day after the vote.
""The plan is clear: creating an anti-European sentiment in Romania that Liviu Dragnea can use when European officials ask him not to destroy the judicial system, rule of law and anti-corruption fight,"" former Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos said.
The government has dismissed the accusations and the Orthodox Church has said a ""Yes"" vote would be Christian, democratic and patriotic. 

Romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001, decades after neighboring countries and LGBT discrimination is widespread.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Candidates began their last day of campaigning on Saturday for Brazil's most polarized presidential race in decades that could elect a far-right former army captain who promises to crack down on corruption, ease gun laws and defend Christian family values.
Front-runner Jair Bolsonaro, 55, has surged on widespread anger over rising crime, a drifting economy and the prospect of the leftist Workers Party returning to power.
His closest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party, whose leader is in jail for receiving bribes.
Final opinion polls on Saturday will show whether Bolsonaro has enough support to win the election outright on Sunday. If no candidate gets a majority, the race will go to a second-round run-off between the two top vote-getters on Oct. 28.
Bolsonaro, who is recovering from a near-fatal stabbing at a rally one month ago, appealed to Brazilians to vote for him in a live Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) feed for his home on Friday night. 
He asked them to give him a majority to avoid a second vote, which some polls have shown his leftist challenger winning.
Haddad's support relies on the popularity of his mentor, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was barred from running due to a corruption conviction. Haddad will campaign on Saturday in Bahia state in the northeast of Brazil where Lula is still a hero because his government did much to relieve poverty. 
About 26 percent of voters say they have yet to decide who to vote for, according a Datafolha poll released on Thursday. It showed outright victory by Bolsonaro was still possible but not likely.
""We will accept the result whatever it is, there should be no doubt of that,"" Bolsonaro said. 
The assurance was aimed at calming fears he would call for a military coup if he lost. Bolsonaro, who is backed by a group of retired generals, said last week he would only accept victory.
A Bolsonaro government would speed up the privatization of state companies to reduce Brazil's budget deficit and relax environmental controls for farming and mining. It would also block efforts to legalize abortion, drugs and gay marriage. 
In an interview published on Friday by the newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo, one of the candidate's top economic advisers said Bolsonaro would push ahead with privatizing state power firm Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras.
However, former army General Oswaldo de Jesus Ferreira pledged to keep state oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, in government hands.
Hydroelectric dam projects on the Tapajos river in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) basin that were stopped due to environmental concerns would be discussed again, Ferreira said. 

But he said the expansion of soy, corn and sugar cane plantations would not be allowed in the Amazon region, where environmentalists say deforestation is on the rise again.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police are investigating the disappearance of Interpol chief, Meng Hongwei, who was reported missing after traveling from France to his native China, and they have placed his wife under protection after threats, the interior ministry said on Friday.
Meng's wife contacted police in Lyon, the French city where the international police agency is based, after not hearing from him since Sept. 25, and after receiving threats by phone and on social media, the ministry said. 
A person familiar with the investigation into the disappearance said the initial working assumption of Western investigators was that Meng had antagonized Chinese authorities in some way and had been detained as a result.
""France is puzzled about the situation of Interpol's president and concerned about the threats made to his wife,"" the ministry said.
Meng's wife, who has remained in Lyon with their children according to police sources, was receiving protection, it said. ""Exchanges with Chinese authorities continue,"" the ministry added.
China has not commented officially on Meng's disappearance and there was no mention of him in official media on Saturday. 
China's Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
There have been several cases in recent years of senior Chinese officials vanishing without explanation, only for the government to announce weeks or even months later that they have been put under investigation, often for suspected corruption. 
It was not clear why Meng, 64, who was named Interpol's president two years ago, had traveled to China. 
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an unnamed source as saying Meng had been taken for questioning as soon as he landed in China, but it also was not clear why.
French police are investigating what is officially termed in France a ""worrying disappearance"". 
Interpol, which groups 192 countries and which is usually focused on finding people who are missing or wanted, said it was aware of reports about Meng's ""alleged disappearance"".
""This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China,"" the agency said in a statement. 
'BIZARRE'
Roderic Broadhurst, a professor of criminology at Australian National University, said Meng's disappearance would be ""pretty disconcerting"" for people in international bodies that work with China, and could ultimately damage China's efforts to develop cooperative legal assistance measures with other countries.
""It is bizarre,"" Broadhurst said on Saturday, adding that China was likely to ""brush off"" any political damage that it would cause to Beijing's involvement in international bodies.
""It's a price that might have to be paid, but I guess they would see that as a cost worth bearing,"" Broadhurst said.
Presidents of Interpol are seconded from their national administrations and remain in their home post while representing the international policing body.
Meng is listed on the website of China's Ministry of Public Security as a vice-minister, but lost his seat on its key Communist Party Committee in April, the South China Morning Post reported.
Meng has almost 40 years' experience in criminal justice and policing, and has overseen matters related to legal institutions, narcotics control and counter-terrorism, according to Interpol's website.
Interpol staff can carry special passports to help speed deployment in emergency situations but that would not have given Meng any specific rights or immunity in his home country. 
When Meng was named Interpol's president in Nov. 2016, human rights groups expressed concern that Beijing might try to leverage his position to pursue dissidents abroad. Beijing has in the past pressed countries to arrest and deport to China citizens it accuses of crimes, from corruption to terrorism.
At the time, Amnesty International called Meng's appointment ""at odds with Interpol's mandate to work in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" 

Diplomats say the role of Interpol president is largely ceremonial, with day-to-day work carried out by its secretary general, Juergen Stock, and his staff.

Defense Minister General Salvador Cienfuegos spoke to reporters during a visit to the town of Teloloapan in the crime-ridden state of Guerrero, where much of the heroin trafficked to the United States is produced. 
Legalization ""is already on the table. I think it can be a way out of the problem,"" Cienfuegos said when asked about violence in the state and proposals to regulate opium production.
Olga Sanchez, the designated interior minister of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has said the next administration will explore regulating opium production for pharmaceutical use.
Guerrero's governor has backed the idea and state lawmakers sent a draft bill to the federal congress in August.
""But it is a subject that will have to be debated. In principle, it seems to me that it is correct,"" Cienfuegos said.
He expressed worries about how to guarantee the safety of farmers if they stop selling drugs to gangs and start providing opium to the government in order to produce morphine.
Leftist Lopez Obrador, who won July's election by a landslide and takes office on Dec. 1, is proposing major changes to the drug war strategy. He has suggested a negotiated peace and amnesty for non-violent drug dealers, traffickers and farmers.
Lopez Obrador is expected to name a new defense minister to replace Cienfuegos soon.

Mexico has been mired for nearly 12 years in a bloody, military-led battle against drug gangs. Cartels have fragmented into warring groups and murders have risen to record levels.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A declaration to end the 1950-53 Korea War could be a ""slippery slope"" to questioning the need for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea, the deputy head of the U.N. Command overseeing the Korean armistice said on Friday, ahead of new talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
Canadian Lieutenant-General Wayne Eyre said North Korea's push for such a declaration could be a ploy to divide the U.S.-South Korea alliance and secure the withdrawal of the 28,500 U.S. troops based in the South.
""You have to question why North Korea is pushing so hard for that end-of-war declaration,"" he told an event at Washington's Carnegie Institute for International Peace.
""The optimistic would say that he (North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) needs it for a domestic audience so he can change his ways and have a new approach; the pessimist would say it’s another way to split the allies apart."" 
While saying that the current mood of detente and negotiation had given hope for a process ""moving forward towards a lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula, Eyre said the North Koreans were ""experts at separating allies.""
""So what could an end-of-war declaration mean? Even if there is no legal basis for it, emotionally people would start to question the presence and the continued existence of the United Nations Command,"" he said.
""And it’s a slippery slope then to question the presence of U.S. forces on the peninsula.""
Eyre spoke as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headed for his fourth visit this year to North Korea, seeking to break an impasse in denuclearization talks and clear the way for a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. Pompeo is due in Pyongyang on Sunday local time, or Saturday U.S. East Coast time, after a stop in Japan.
North Korea had long sought a formal end to the Korean War to replace the armistice that stopped the fighting but left it and the U.S.-led U.N. Command still technically at war. 
At a June 12 summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore, the U.S. leader pledged security guarantees for North Korea if it abandoned nuclear weapons that potentially threaten the United States.
Trump has said he wants ""at some point"" to bring back U.S. troops from Korea..

South Korean President Moon Jae-in is seeking an end-of-war declaration by the year-end, arguing it would encourage North Korea to denuclearize. Washington has argued that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 07:49PM ET</span>",Backing from senators puts Kavanaugh on track for U.S. Supreme Court,"By Richard Cowan and Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, looked headed for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday after two crucial senators said that sexual misconduct accusations against the judge would not prevent them from voting to confirm him.
If Kavanaugh is approved in a final Senate vote, likely on Saturday, Trump will have achieved a victory in his drive to consolidate conservative dominance of the nation's highest court and move the American judiciary rightward.
Two key senators, Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin, both seen as swing votes, said they would support Kavanaugh, after weeks of debate about sexual violence and the nominee's character and temperament that gripped the nation. 
A sharply partisan battle over the nomination became an intense personal and political drama when university professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students in Maryland in 1982. 
Collins, in remarks on the Senate floor explaining her decision to back Kavanaugh, said Ford's accusations against him ""fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard."" 
As protesters in a Capitol Hill hallway shouted, ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"", Manchin told reporters an FBI investigation, which did not find corroborating evidence of Ford's accusations, was thorough.
“I believe Dr. Ford. Something happened to Dr. Ford. I don’t believe the facts show that it was Brett Kavanaugh, but I believe something happened,” Manchin said. 
Two other women also made accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh in the 1980s. He denied those accusations, as well as Ford's, in angry testimony to a Senate committee.
About 100 demonstrators were arrested on Friday in Senate office buildings, the Capitol Building, and outside the Supreme Court, the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. More than 300 were arrested on Thursday.
If confirmed, Kavanaugh would tip the court's balance to a 5-4 conservative majority in possible legal battles ahead over contentious issues such as abortion rights, immigration, and Trump's attempt to ban transgender people from the military. 
Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the U.S. Senate, and with the two key senators choosing to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, the confirmation looked locked-in late on Friday. 
Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, a group that opposes Trump’s judicial nominees, said Kavanaugh would join the court ""with a cloud over his head."" 
""He will be an illegitimate justice, and his confirmation will mark a point of no return for the Supreme Court's reputation as the one, apolitical branch of government,""  Fallon said.
HEADED FOR THE COURT
In theory, Kavanaugh could be confirmed, sworn in and sitting on the mahogany bench in the traditional black justice's robe by Tuesday, when the court is next in session. White House officials have said Kavanaugh would be sworn in swiftly. 
The Kavanaugh fight has riveted Americans just weeks before Nov. 6 elections in which Democrats are trying to take control of Congress from the Republicans.
Several recent polls show that Republican enthusiasm about voting, which had lagged behind Democrats, jumped after a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week.
But Democrats say women angered at the Kavanaugh accusations will turn out in large numbers to vote out Republicans.
Trump, himself accused by numerous women during the 2016 presidential election of sexual misconduct, tweeted his approval of the Senate vote on Friday, saying, ""Very proud of the U.S. Senate for voting 'YES' to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh!"" 
Senators had backed Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, in a procedural vote earlier on Friday that moved the Republican-controlled Senate toward a definitive decision. 
Trump has made appointing conservative judges a major plank of his presidency, and last year his nominee Neil Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate. 
Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee was broadcast live on television last Thursday and captured the attention of some 20 million people watching on broadcast and cable networks. 
In an angry rebuttal later that day, Kavanaugh said the accusations were part of a ""political hit"" by Democrats. 
His nomination became a flashpoint in the #MeToo social media movement against sexual harassment and assault. Trump mocked Ford on Tuesday during a political rally in Mississippi, further angering Democrats and women campaigning for an end to sexual violence. 
The FBI sent Congress documents detailing additional interviews about Kavanaugh that the agency conducted at the request of some Republican and Democratic senators.
While the documents have not been made public, Republicans said they did not back up sexual assault allegations by Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California.
Similarly, Republicans said the FBI found nobody to support assault claims by Deborah Ramirez, who was a classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale University in the 1980s.

Democrats called the FBI report a whitewash and said the White House placed constraints on the FBI, which did not speak to many potential witnesses.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 07:38PM ET</span>",Pompeo doesn't see China tensions hurting North Korea talks,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - China will be part of the solution to the North Korean crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday, brushing aside the possibility that worsening U.S. tensions with Beijing could hamper efforts to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
Speaking to a pool reporter en route to his fourth visit this year to North Korea, Pompeo said the aim of his talks in Pyongyang at the weekend would be ""to make sure we understand what each side is truly trying to achieve.""
He said he also hoped to be able to agree a ""general date and location"" for a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Asked whether increasing tensions with China would hamper his efforts after Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday signaled a tough new approach to Beijing going beyond a bitter trade war, Pompeo said China had consistently made clear it wanted to see North Korean denuclearization.
""And they have said in spite of places where we have disagreements and other things - we have had disagreement on trade and the like - that they are determined to support our efforts to see this through to its completion, consistently since we first began this process,"" he said.
""We know that China is going to be part of the solution, that'll ultimately be when we get to the end,"" he said. ""If we do this well we will have signed a peace treaty that ends the armistice, that China will be part of that.""
Kim pledged at an unprecedented June 12 meeting with Trump to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but his actions since have fallen short of Washington's demands for irreversible steps to give up an arsenal that potentially threatens the United States.
Pompeo declined to give details of his planned negotiations when asked if he would agree to North Korean demands for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War or to South Korea's suggestion that to break the current stalemate, he should avoid pressing again for an inventory of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Pompeo's last trip to North Korea did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July hailing progress, only for North Korea to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands.""
Pompeo has angered North Korea recently by insisting that international sanctions must remain in place until it gives up its nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, he said there was unanimous support for this at last week's U.N. General Assembly, even if Russia and China ""had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them.""
Pompeo will visit Japan on Saturday before heading to Pyongyang, where he is due to arrive on Sunday morning local time, or on Saturday evening U.S. East Coast time.
After a stop in Seoul, Pompeo is due to head to China on Monday.

He said that in Beijing, if it was like previous visits, he would meet the Chinese government's top diplomat, Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi, and his predecessor Yang Jiechi.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - White Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday for the 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald, touching off celebratory street demonstrations in a case that had laid bare tensions between the black community and police.
Van Dyke, 40, was also convicted of 16 counts of aggravated battery, one count for each of the shots fired. McDonald, 17, was killed while armed with a knife as he walked down the center of a street in the third-largest U.S. city.
Jurors said they faulted Van Dyke for escalating the conflict when he could have waited for more police assistance, such as an officer with a non-lethal Taser weapon.
Van Dyke sat emotionless as the verdict was read. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Vincent Gaughan immediately revoked bail and Van Dyke was escorted out of the courtroom and into Cook County Jail.
He faces up to 20 years in prison for the second-degree murder conviction and up to 30 years for each of the 16 counts of aggravated battery.
His conviction seemed to quell any potential unrest of the kind that has occurred in other U.S. cities in recent years when white officers have been cleared of charges in the shooting deaths of black men.
""The end of this trial brings an opportunity for the community to come together,"" special prosecutor Joseph McMahon told reporters. 
Police killings of mostly unarmed black men elsewhere in the United States helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement and became an issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
Chicago had its own unrest when a police dashboard camera video was released more than a year after the shooting which occurred on the night of Oct. 20, 2014. 
The video showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald as he walked down the middle of the street, veering slightly away from the officer. The aftermath led to the dismissal of the city's police superintendent and calls for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign. 
After Friday's verdict, small, peaceful demonstrations assembled in central Chicago. About 100 people marched toward a gathering spot.
""Whose streets? Our streets!"" some chanted. One protester bellowed into a megaphone: ""This is what black power looks like.""
""We are in celebration mode but we also want to hold more people accountable,"" said one of the protesters, Darius Parker, 28, who estimated the crowd would have been 10 times larger had Van Dyke been acquitted.
The 12-person jury, which included one black person, began deliberations on Thursday afternoon.
After failing to reach a verdict on Thursday night, they began anew on Friday, finding enough mitigating circumstances to convict Van Dyke of second- rather than first-degree murder, jurors told reporters.
""In Van Dyke's mind, he was doing the right thing. He was experiencing an extreme threat ... he needed to protect himself,"" one man on the jury told reporters. The jurors who spoke to reporters were not identified by name.
But jurors were swayed by the video, which prosecutors showed repeatedly during the three-week trial and which jurors reviewed during deliberations.
""We kept watching the video where he kept making the steps forward,"" said another juror. ""We watched that more than once. More than three times."" 
Van Dyke testified in his own defense, saying he feared for his safety and fired because McDonald was advancing on him. Both the officer and his lawyers argued that the angle of the video did not reflect the incident from Van Dyke's perspective.
But Van Dyke's testimony seemed rehearsed and ""we just didn't buy it,"" a third juror said. 
Defense lawyer Daniel Herbert said he would appeal and push for a change of venue, which was denied to the defense in this trial. 

""We knew coming into it with a Cook County venue in this case with the Cook County jury there was not a chance in the world we were going to come away with a complete not guilty,"" Herbert told reporters.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday blocked the Trump Administration from placing conditions on public safety grants to further its crackdown on illegal immigration, and he ordered the grant money to be released to California ""sanctuary cities.""
However, while Judge William Orrick in San Francisco found that the conditions placed last year on public safety grants by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions were unconstitutional, he stayed a nationwide injunction pending appeal.
The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.
The grant conditions required recipients to provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents access to jails and prisons, provide notice when detainees were being released and certify that information was being shared with federal authorities. 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued the administration in August 2017. The state argued that putting the conditions on the $28 million in federal funds it expected would undermine law enforcement and deter police cooperation by immigrants, a major population in the state.
Scores of jurisdictions around the United States have adopted some form of ""sanctuary city"" policies, which generally prohibit cooperation with immigration officials. U.S. President Donald Trump had made a removing illegal immigrants a key campaign pledge and he often criticizes the sanctuary cities. 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles have successfully sued the Trump Administration over the conditions on the public safety funds, known as a Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, and those cases are pending appeal.
The use of nationwide injunctions by U.S. District Courts have been a major roadblock to numerous Trump policies, and the appeals in the sanctuary city cases may provide an avenue for the administration to curtail their use by lower courts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is actively considering waivers on sanctions it will reimpose next month for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil, a U.S. government official said on Friday. 
The administration withdrew from a deal over Tehran's nuclear program in May and is unilaterally reimposing sanctions on Iran's crude oil consumers on Nov. 4. The sanctions aim to force Tehran to stop its involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and halt its ballistic missile program. Iran says it has abided by the 2015 nuclear deal, which was struck with five other world powers, besides the United States. 
The administration is ""in the midst of an internal process"" of considering exceptions called SRE waivers, or significant reduction exemptions, said a government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
It was the first time a U.S. official said the administration was in the process of considering waivers. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in India last month that the administration would consider waivers and that some buyers of Iranian oil would take a ""little bit of time"" to unwind their trade with Iran.
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Thursday that the administration's objective was that there be no waivers and ""exports of Iranian oil and gas and condensates drops to zero."" He added that the administration would not necessarily achieve that.
The administration is ""prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis,"" the official said. 

The comments followed news that India, Iran's No. 2 oil customer after China, will buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November. It was an indication that India will continue purchasing crude from Iran, despite the Trump administration's push to get countries to stop their purchases.

Slovakia has long stood with others in central Europe in opposition to EU executive attempts to push mandatory relocation quotas. 
In an interview on the sidelines of the Globsec Tatra Summit in the Slovak mountains, Pellegrini said Slovakia was a rich enough country to be able to take care of ""ten, twenty or thirty children"" currently placed in a refugee camp in Greece. 
""We are politicians but when we look at the suffering of the Syrian orphans, currently being taken care of by another member state, I think we should be more humane,"" Pellegrini said.
""Slovakia's economy, Slovakia's society, or Slovakia's culture can't be threatened by several dozen orphans who would be placed in our children's homes ... They would learn our language and our culture,"" he added.

Slovakia at times in the past has taken in some asylum seekers, including temporarily housing hundreds from neighbouring Austria while their requests were being assessed.

SARAJEVO/BANJA LUKA (Reuters) - Protests organized in Bosnia's two largest cities on Friday by a pair of fathers demanding the truth about the alleged murders of their sons overshadowed rallies for Sunday's general election.
The young men's parents and the opposition accuse the authorities of being involved in what they say were murders that were concealed by police and prosecutors for political reasons.
Wide public support for the two grieving fathers has bridged Bosnia's ethnic divisions, reflecting discontent with a political system and judiciary mired in corruption and party dominance in the 23 years since the country's 1992-95 war ended.
Final rallies ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections were scheduled for Friday evening, coinciding with protests in the capital Sarajevo and the northwestern town of Banja Luka.
But the main opposition bloc in the autonomous Serb Republic, the Alliance for Victory (SzP), canceled its gathering in Banja Luka, as did two opposition parties in Sarajevo, in a show of solidarity with the grieving families.
The two fathers - Davor Dragicevic, a Serb from Banja Luka, and Muriz Memic, a Muslim Bosniak from Sarajevo - decided to hold simultaneous protests before the vote to put pressure on the judiciary to speed up proceedings into their sons' deaths.
""Let's make the revolution with pens,"" Memic urged several thousand protesters in Sarajevo, referring to Sunday's election. The protesters chanted ""We want justice"" and carried placards demanding ""Justice for Dzenan"". Some cried. 
The protest in Banja Luka was delayed after armed Bosnian Serb police stopped buses carrying supporters from other towns. Traffic in the city center was halted and police cruised the streets in armored vehicles. 
Dragicevic first said protesters would blockade the city unless all their supporters were allowed to join them, but the protest later went ahead and ended without incident. 
""The Interior Ministry organized the murder of David Dragicevic,"" his father said, naming the officials allegedly involved. ""This is a criminal state, criminal police."" 
About a 20,000-strong crowd chanted ""Killers!"" and booed when he mentioned Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, whose SNSD party held its final rally at a square just few miles away attended by few thousand supporters. 
Dodik has said the death is a matter for prosecutors but that he sympathizes with the family's pain.
The Serb Republic authorities have repeatedly accused the opposition of trying to make political gains from the case. 
Dragicevic, who along with his supporters has held daily protests for more than six months, said his 21-year-old son, who was found dead in March in a creek in Banja Luka a week after he went missing, was captured, tortured and brutally murdered. 
The police said he had drowned and had alcohol and drugs in his system.
In Sarajevo, 22-year-old Dzenan Memic died of wounds to his head in 2016 and the prosecution first said he was murdered. Prosecutors later declared that new evidence showed he had been killed in a car accident but his family has never accepted the decision, saying a murder was covered up.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church under Patriarch Filaret is leading a drive to establish a national church independent of the Russian Orthodox Church in the face of strong opposition from Moscow.
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill wrote to all branches of the Orthodox world, calling for talks to discuss the situation around church life in Ukraine.
The Bulgarian Church's Holy Synod, its top executive body, however, said in a statement only that Kirill's letter would be submitted for consideration by a special commission - effectively a stalling move.
The Ukrainian church split from its Russian parent following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, but Filaret has stepped up his drive for an independent national church since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in the eastern Donbass region.
The row in Orthodox Christianity has deepened with the Russian Church saying it will no longer take part in structures chaired by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Turkey, the global spiritual leadership of Orthodox Christians, whose backing the Ukrainians are seeking for their independence bid. 
The Eastern Orthodox Church is the second largest Christian denomination worldwide with more than 250 million members. But unlike the Roman Catholic Church it has no supreme leader comparable to the Pope but instead is composed mainly of de facto national churches, each led by a patriarch.

""I love working with him. You know, you have to accept that any friend will say good things and bad things,"" Prince Mohammed said in a Bloomberg interview published on Friday.
“We believe that all the armaments we have from the United States of America are paid for, it’s not free armament. So ever since the relationship started between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America, we’ve bought everything with money,” Prince Mohammed added.
Trump made the comments at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday. Despite the harsh words, the Trump administration has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, which it views as a bulwark against Iran’s ambitions in the region.
Trump made Saudi Arabia his first stop on his maiden international trip as president last year.
Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter and the de facto leader of OPEC, which has been criticized by Trump for high oil prices.

ABU DHABI/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will allow Turkey to search its consulate in Istanbul for prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who has been missing for three days after entering the diplomatic mission earlier this week.
""The premises are sovereign territory, but we will allow them to enter and search and do whatever they want to do. We have nothing to hide,"" Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a Bloomberg interview published on Friday.
He said Khashoggi had left the building not long after he entered. Asked if Khashoggi faces charges in Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed said it was first important to discover where he was.
“If he’s in Saudi Arabia, I would know that,” he added.
Human rights groups have called on Saudi Arabia to verify Khashoggi's whereabouts after Turkish and Saudi authorities offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there is no evidence he left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying that he exited the same day.
Khashoggi, who has lived in self-exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his critical views, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documentation for an forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancée, who waited outside.
If Saudi Arabia had detained Khashoggi without acknowledging it, his detention would constitute an enforced disappearance, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. It called on Turkey to deepen its investigation into the case.
""The burden of proof is on Saudi Arabia to produce evidence for its claim that Khashoggi left the consulate alone, and that Saudi agents have not detained him,"" said Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson.
Press freedom watchdogs also raised red flags, while the Washington Post, which has regularly featured Khashoggi's writing since last year, published a blank space where his column would normally appear.
""Given the Saudi authorities' pattern of quietly detaining critical journalists, Khashoggi's failure to emerge from the Saudi consulate on the day he entered is a cause for alarm,"" said Sherif Mansour, Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Sophie Anmuth, head of the Middle East desk for Reporters Without Borders, called on both governments to ensure Khashoggi reappears quickly.
""Until otherwise demonstrated, he is still inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the Saudi authorities are responsible for his safety and well-being,"" she said in a statement.
Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancée, told Reuters he had been concerned about a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom, but assumed he was safe outside the country.
Turan Kişlakçı, a friend who heads the Arab Turkish Media Association, said Khashoggi received assurances from Saudi officials before his visit that he could enter safely.
Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters that Khashoggi remained in the consulate and the authorities were negotiating with the Saudis to resolve the issue.
The consulate said it was working with the Turkish government to ""uncover the circumstances"" of his disappearance.
Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
Over the past year, he has written columns inveighing against Saudi policies toward Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.
Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt said the newspaper had reached out to ""anyone we think might be able to help locate him and assure his safety,"" including U.S., Turkish and Saudi officials.

Saudi Arabia is ranked 169th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index, a few places behind Turkey. All public protests are banned in the kingdom, as are political parties.

The Israeli army said it was defending against members of the crowd who were throwing grenades and explosives at its soldiers.
Thousands of Palestinians had gathered for a weekly protest along Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Islamist group Hamas.
Gaza's Health Ministry said three Palestinians, including a 12-year-old boy, were shot dead by Israeli forces. At least 126 others were wounded by bullets, it said.
Israel's military said in a statement that some Palestinians were ""throwing explosive devices and grenades, rolling burning tires and hurling rocks"" at its soldiers and the border fence. A group even crossed the fence into Israel to throw grenades before returning to the Gaza Strip, it said.
No Israelis were wounded.
Israeli army gunfire has killed at least 195 Palestinians since the border protests began in March, Gaza medics say. An Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper. Tracts of Israeli land have been burnt up by incendiary materials flown over the border by kite or balloon.
Gaza protesters demand an end to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade and rights to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948.

Israel accuses Hamas of orchestrating the protests to provide cover for attacks and distract from Gaza’s economic plight, allegations it denies. Hamas seized control of Gaza from Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 and has since fought three wars with Israel, most recently in 2014.

STRBSKE PLESO, Slovakia (Reuters) - There is a better than 50 percent chance that the European Union reaches an agreement this month with Britain on its withdrawal from the bloc but any deal needs to respect the EU's four essential freedoms, Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said on Friday.
In an interview on the sidelines of the Globsec Tatra Summit in the Slovak mountains, Pellegrini said a deal could not ignore the indivisibility of the freedoms of movement of labor, goods, services and capital.
The priority is to have the framework of a deal agreed when EU leaders meet in mid-October, ahead of a November summit where final technical details can be worked out, he said. 
""We cannot accept that the United Kingdom would want to make only the freedom of the free movement of goods valid,"" he told Reuters. ""We can respect either the full package or nothing."" 
Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with Britain is ""very close"", diplomatic sources told Reuters on Friday, in a sign a compromise on the most contentious issue of the future Irish border might be in the making.
The two sides are trying to push a divorce deal as well as an outline agreement on post-Brexit relations over the line in time for leaders' summits scheduled for Oct. 17-18 and Nov. 17-18.
""We have make the maximum effort to have a general agreement (on withdrawal) on the table in October,"" Pellegrini said.
He said he was still optimistic and the bloc was acting as one, adding that there was little time to spare with Britain's scheduled exit from the EU less than six months away in March.

""We cannot drag out talks forever. The date of exit is coming near and we have to have clarity at least in November,"" he said.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Latvia election to test anti-Russian resolve,"By Johan Ahlander and Gederts Gelzis
RIGA (Reuters) - Latvians are set to vote on Saturday in parliamentary elections in which the rise of an anti-establishment party will test Riga's long-standing role as one of West's bulwarks against Russia.
Latvia, a member of the European Union and NATO, shares a 270-kilometer (167 miles) border with Russia which makes it a frontline state in the increasingly hostile relationship between the West and President Vladimir Putin.
NATO currently has more than 1,000 troops deployed in the Baltic country of 2 million and even the potential of a minor shift in allegiance in Latvia will worry both Brussels and Washington. 
Latvia's mainstream parties have resolutely kept pro-Russian politicians from power as they sought ever closer ties with the West. At the last election, Harmony, a party whose main support is from Latvia's ethnic Russian minority, won the most seats but was excluded from power when the other parties refused to include it in any deal due to its ties with Russia.
But the populist KPV LV party and its leader Artuss Kaimins, whose popularity has soared as he railed against corrupt politicians, has sent mixed messages on whether he would also rule out such a deal. 
""We are at a crossroads. Either we will form a new government or they will,"" said Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis of the Union of Greens and Farmers party.
A KPV-Harmony ruling alliance would represent ""a rather radical change of Latvia's position toward the European Union and toward our security matters which, I think, is very dangerous,"" he said. 
Kucinskis' conservative government coalition looks well short of winning a majority. Recent polls suggest Harmony will remain the biggest party, followed by the Union of Greens and Farmers and Kaimins' KPV LV. 
Harmony, which currently holds 24 out of the 100 seats in parliament, recently rebranded itself as a Western-style Social Democratic party, saying it is committed to the European Union and NATO. 
But it only ended its official cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia Party last year, raising concerns its transformation is only skin deep. 
Harmony could be used by Russia to influence EU affairs, said Andis Kudors, executive director of the Centre for East European Policy Studies.
""It (Harmony) is like a kind of Trojan horse in (the) European Union when we speak about common European Union foreign policy in regards to Russia."" 
The KPV backs EU and NATO membership, but its vague election program has left many wondering what could happen if it takes power.
Kaimins, who declined several requests from Reuters for interviews, has said he is open to working with Harmony if it condemns Russia's role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine and drops demands for Russian-language education in Latvian schools.

Harmony has not ruled out working with any party and has said KPVs voters will have to be respected.

Mayor Nir Barkat said on Thursday he had developed a plan to end the Jerusalem operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which aids Palestinians displaced by the 1948 war of Israel’s founding and to millions of their descendants, and to replace them with Israeli services.
UNRWA has faced a financial crisis since the United States in August announced it was cutting aid to the body, calling it an ""irredeemably flawed operation"" with an ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries"".
Barkat, on Twitter, said the U.S. decision created an opportunity to change the current situation, which he said would otherwise ""perpetuate the 'refugee problem' and encourage incitement"".
UNRWA, in a statement, said it ""expresses its concern about recent statements made by the mayor of Jerusalem on its operations and installations in East Jerusalem"".
""UNRWA has continuously maintained operations in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem since 1967 with the cooperation and on the basis of a formal agreement with the State of Israel, which remains in force,"" it said.
It said it provided education, health, relief and social services in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want as a capital of a future state.
Barkat said that under his plan the municipality would take over education, welfare and health services. ""We provide services for all residents alike - there are no refugees in our city,"" he said.
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital. The government's Central Bureau of Statistics says it has a population of 900,000, including about 340,000 Arabs.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past called for UNRWA to be dismantled.

BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo/CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts/OSLO (Reuters) - Denis Mukwege, a doctor who helps victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nadia Murad, a Yazidi rights activist and survivor of sexual slavery by Islamic State, won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
They were honored for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.
""Denis Mukwege is the helper who has devoted his life to defending these victims. Nadia Murad is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others,"" the Committee said in its citation.
""Each of them in their own way has helped to give greater visibility to war-time sexual violence, so that the perpetrators can be held accountable for their actions.""
Mukwege heads the Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congo city of Bukavu. The clinic receives thousands of women each year, many of them requiring surgery from sexual violence.
Murad is an advocate for the Yazidi minority in Iraq and for refugee and women's rights in general. She was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.
""Rape in war has been a crime for centuries. But it was a crime in the shadows. The two laureates have both shone a light on it,"" Dan Smith, Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told Reuters.
Mukwege, a past winner of the United Nations Human Rights Prize and the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, dedicated his Nobel award to all women affected by rape and sexual violence.
He has performed surgery on scores of women after they had been raped by armed men, and campaigned to highlight their plight. He also provides HIV/AIDS treatment as well as free maternal care. 
Although the Second Congo War, which killed more than five million people, formally ended in 2003, violence remains rampant, with militias frequently targeting civilians.
The Panzi Hospital has also been the target of threats, and in 2012 Mukwege's home was invaded by armed men who held his daughters at gunpoint, shot at him and killed his bodyguard.
Shortly before that attack, he had denounced mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo and impunity for it in a speech at the United Nations. 
""He has risked his life to help women survive atrocity,"" said SIPRI's Smith.
Mukwege was in the operation room when he was told the news.
Later, speaking at a news conference at the hospital, he said the prize was an important recognition of many women's trauma. 
""Dear survivors all over the world, I would like to tell you that through this prize, the world is listening to you and rejects indifference, the world refuses to stand idly by in the face of your suffering,"" he said.
Wivine Moleka, a member of Congo's ruling PPRD party, said Mukwege was more than just a doctor.
""He is a humanist who has taken the pain of women into consideration, pain in their flesh and in their soul. The prize sends a strong signal to everyone about these women who are raped every day,"" she said.
SURVIVAL
Murad said she shared the award ""with all Yazidis with all the Iraqis, Kurds and all the minorities and all survivors of sexual violence around the world"".
""For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by Daesh,"" she said in a statement to Reuters, using an Arabic term for Islamic State. 
Murad was 21-years-old in 2014 when Islamic State militants attacked the village where she had grown up in northern Iraq. The militants killed those who refused to convert to Islam, including six of her brothers and her mother.
Along with many of the other young women in her village, she was taken into captivity by the militants, and sold repeatedly for sex as part of Islamic State's slave trade. 
She escaped captivity with the help of a Sunni Muslim family in Mosul, then IS's de facto capital in Iraq, and became an advocate for the rights of her community around the world.
In 2017, Murad published a memoir of her ordeal, ""The Last Girl"". She recounted in harrowing detail her months in captivity, her escape and her journey to activism. 
""At some point, there was rape and nothing else. This becomes your normal day,"" she wrote. 
The United Nations has called the assaults launched by the Sunni militants against the religious minority in northern Iraq a campaign of genocide. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated her on the award, and Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, said: ""It is the victory of good and peace over the forces of darkness.""
Murad, who is also a Sakharov Prize winner, is the second youngest Nobel Prize laureate after Malala Yousafzai.
SPEAK UP
The award follows a year in which the abuse and mistreatment of women in all walks of life across the globe has been a focus of attention. 
Asked whether the #metoo movement, a prominent women's rights activist forum, was an inspiration for this year's prize, Nobel Committee Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said: ""Metoo and war crimes are not quite the same. But they have in common that they see the suffering of women, the abuse of women and that it is important that women leave the concept of shame behind and speak up.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the award was part of a growing movement to recognize the violence and injustice faced by women.
""Let us honor these new Nobel laureates by standing up for victims of sexual violence everywhere,"" he said in a statement.
The prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.

CHERNOBYL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine unveiled a solar plant in Chernobyl on Friday, just across from where a power station, now encased in a giant sarcophagus, caused the world's worst nuclear disaster three decades ago.
Built in a contaminated area, which remains largely uninhabitable and where visitors are accompanied by guides carrying radiation meters, 3,800 panels produce energy to power 2,000 apartments. 
In April 1986, a botched test at reactor number 4 at the Soviet plant sent clouds of nuclear material billowing across Europe and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.
Thirty-one plant workers and firemen died in the immediate aftermath of the accident, mostly from acute radiation sickness.
Thousands more later succumbed to radiation-related illnesses such as cancer, although the total death toll and long-term health effects remain a subject of intense debate. 
""It's not just another solar power plant,"" Evhen Variagin, the chief executive of Solar Chernobyl LLC, told reporters. ""It's really hard to underestimate the symbolism of this particular project.""
The one-megawatt solar plant is a joint project by Ukrainian company Rodina and Germany's Enerparc AG, costing around 1 million euros ($1.2 million) and benefiting from feed-in tariffs that guarantee a certain price for power. 
It is the first time the site has produced power since 2000, when the nuclear plant was finally shut down. Valery Seyda, head of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, said it had looked like the site would never produce energy again. 
""But now we are seeing a new sprout, still small, weak, producing power on this site and this is very joyful,"" he said.
Two years ago, a giant arch weighing 36,000 tonnes was pulled over the nuclear power station to create a casement to block radiation and allow the remains of the reactor to be dismantled safely.
It comes at a time of sharply increasing investment in renewables in Ukraine. Between January and September, more than 500 MW of renewable power capacity was added in the country, more than twice as much as in 2017, the government says. 
Yulia Kovaliv, who heads the Office of the National Investment Council of Ukraine, said investors want to reap the benefits from a generous subsidy scheme before parliament is due to vote on scrapping it in July next year. 
""Investors expect that in the renewable energy sector facilities launched before 2019 will operate on the current (beneficial) system of green tariffs,"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Odessa in September. 
""And that is why investors want to buy ready-to-build projects in order to complete construction before that time.""

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",What is Russia's GRU military intelligence agency?,"By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - The West has accused Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) of running what it described as a global hacking campaign, targeting institutions from sports anti-doping bodies to a nuclear power company and the chemical weapons watchdog.
What is GRU and what does it do?
What is the GRU?
Russia's military intelligence service is commonly known by the Russian acronym GRU, which stands for the Main Intelligence Directorate. Its name was formally changed in 2010 to the Main Directorate (or just GU) of the general staff, but its old acronym - GRU - is still more widely used.
Its published aims are the supply of military intelligence to the Russian president and government. Additional aims include ensuring Russia's military, economic and technological security.
The GRU answers directly to the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, each of whom are thought to have access to Russia's portable nuclear briefcase.
Russia's two other main intelligence and security services were both created from the Soviet-era KGB: the Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, and the Federal Security Service, or FSB.
What are the GRU's capabilities?
According to a Western assessment of GRU seen by Reuters, the GRU has a long-running program to run 'illegal' spies - those who work without diplomatic cover and who live under an assumed identity for years until orders from Moscow.
""It has a long-running program of 'illegals' reserved for the most sensitive or deniable tasks across the spectrum of GRU operations,"" the assessment said. 
The GRU is seen as a major Russian cyber player.
""It plays an increasingly important role in Russia’s development of Information Warfare (both defensive and offensive),"" according to the Western assessment.
""It is an aggressive and well-funded organization which has the direct support of – and access to – [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, allowing freedom in its activities and leniency with regards to diplomatic and legislative scrutiny,"" according to the assessment.
The GRU also has a considerable special forces unit. They are the elite of the Russian military. 
""I don't like rankings but the GRU is in the top levels of this business,"" Onno Eichelsheim, director of the Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service, told Reuters. ""They are a very real threat.""
What are Western claims about GRU?
- The United States sanctioned GRU officers including its chief, Igor Korobov, for cyber attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Russia denied meddling in the election. 
- Britain said two GRU officers attempted to murder former GRU double agent Sergei Skripal with Novichok. Russia denied any involvement.
- Britain said GRU was behind the BadRabbit attack of 2017, the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, and attacks on the computer systems of both the Foreign Office and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in 2018. Russia said the accusations were fiction.
- The Netherlands said it caught four GRU cyber spies trying to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It said the same group, known as unit 26165, had targeted the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17.
- The United States charged seven GRU officers with plots to hack the World Anti-Doping Agency which had exposed a Russian doping program.
- GRU played a significant role in the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the conflict in Ukraine and the 2008 conflict with Georgia. 
Note: The GRU does not have its own public web site and does not comment publicly on its actions. Its structure, staff numbers and financing are state secrets. 
What is GRU's history?
Russian spies trace their history back to at least the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th Century, who established a feared espionage service.
The GRU was founded as the Registration Directorate in 1918 after the Bolshevik Revolution. Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services, which saw it as a rival.
While the once mighty KGB was broken up during the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the GRU remained intact.
GRU officers played a significant role in some of the key junctures of the Cold War and post-Soviet history - from the Cuban Missile crisis to Afghan war and the annexation of Crimea.

The public was given a rare chance to see parts of the GRU’s Moscow headquarters when Putin visited it in 2006. He was shown taking part in shooting practice.

Scottish lawmakers opposed to Brexit filed a petition with Scotland's Court of Session last year to show that Britain has a unilateral option of staying in the world's biggest trading bloc, once the outcome of Brexit is known.
They argue that while there is no legal doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 EU member states, it should seek to establish a legal right to do so unilaterally, whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not.
The news comes as Britain appears to be on the brink of an agreement with Brussels over its decision to leave the European Union, diplomatic sources said on Friday.
Because no country has ever left the EU before, the exact meaning of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which regulates withdrawal from the EU is untested.
""We have our hearing on November 27 at 9am"" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This shows the ECJ is moving at breakneck speed on this case."" 
The ECJ, which rules on the meaning of EU law, hopes to make a decision on the case before Christmas, a source close to the case told Reuters on Thursday. No one at the ECJ was available to comment.

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - Hundreds of members of a conservative Hindu group in southern India will lie down at the entrance of a hill temple to stop women of menstruating age from entering, its chief said, even after the top court last week lifted a centuries-old ban.
The government of the state of Kerala is bracing for a face-off between the protesters and women and girls aged 10-50 who want to visit the Sabarimala hill temple, which attracts tens of millions of pilgrims every year, when it re-opens on Oct. 17.
The state's police force has asked neighboring states to provide policewomen for the protests because some of its own have refused to be rostered for duty because they support the ban.
Last week, India's Supreme Court lifted the ban, saying it was upholding rights to equality of worship.
The temple authorities had said the ban was essential to the rites related to the temple's chief deity, Ayyappan, considered eternally celibate.
""Hundreds of our men will lie down at the entry point of the hill when the temple opens at 5 pm on Oct. 17"" for the pooja, or prayer ceremony, said Rahul Easwar, chief of the Ayyappa Dharma Sena. The group of devotees is fighting the lifting of the ban and he is the grandson of a former chief priest at Sabarimala.
""Those women who come to worship defying the temple custom will have to walk through our bodies,"" Easwar told Reuters, adding the protest was not against the judiciary but against the move by the state to implement the order hastily.
His group would file a plea on Friday seeking a review of the verdict, Easwar said, urging the state government to maintain the status quo while that is being considered.
The Communist party-led state government has accepted the order and vowed to provide protection to women visiting the shrine.
The state has witnessed sporadic protests from devotees, including women, since the order and both of India's main political parties, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress, have been critical of the lifting of the ban.
Congress is staging a day-long fast in Pathanamthitta district, which is home to the temple, on Friday.
""The political parties are trying to fish in troubled waters,"" said P. Geetha, a prominent women's activist, who has been demanding gender equality at Sabarimala.
She said that they were taking advantage of the protests for political gain and that those supporting the ban were trying to make Sabarimala a conflict zone to dissuade women of menstruating age from going there.
The police chief of Pathanamthitta district, T. Narayanan, said preparations are being made to implement the order.

""We have taken note of the protests. We will assess the situation next week and come out with the measures to be taken for the security at Sabarimala,"" Narayanan said.

The indictment cited by police said the five had founded in 2016 a group called the ""Vietnam National Coalition"" that was intent on overthrowing the state.
The group's chairman, Luu Van Vinh, had written posts on social media ""saying that the current political regime of Vietnam was outdated and would be eliminated"", the Ministry of Public Security said on its official news website.
Vinh was handed a 15-year jail term, while the others were given lighter sentences, but even after their release they will all face additional three years of house arrest, the police said.
Reuters could not immediately reach the lawyers for the five. VnExpress online newspaper reported that Vinh had not pleaded guilty at the trial.
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party does not tolerate criticism and is particularly sensitive to organized groups of dissidents.
State media reports cited the indictment as saying that the coalition ""distorted the guidelines and policies of the (Communist) Party of Vietnam"".
Vietnam earlier this year had jailed several members of a pro-democracy group, having accused them of ""anti-government activities"". 
Several members of the Viet Tan, a U.S.-based human rights group that Vietnam regards as a ""terrorist"" body, have also been jailed in Vietnam over the recent years.

Abiy assumed power in April after his predecessor resigned following three years of unrest. Abiy ""will lead the ruling party until the next congress"", his chief of staff Fitsum Arega wrote on his Twitter feed.
The re-election of Abiy, by a secret ballot at the end of the coalition's three-day congress, was expected. 
Six months ago Abiy took the helm of the once Marxist-Leninist EPRDF at a moment of crisis for the coalition that has ruled Ethiopia with an iron fist since toppling a military regime and taking power in 1991. 
The changes that he has introduced since taking office include making peace with arch-foe Eritrea, freeing political prisoners, pledging to open up the state-controlled economy and promising to overhaul the security services.

There has also been a surge in violence along ethnic lines since he came to power, however.

Moscow said on Tuesday it had delivered the surface-to-air missile system after the downing of a Russian spy plane by Syrian forces in September. Russia accused Israel of being indirectly responsible for that act because the Syrian forces had been firing at attacking Israel jets. 
""France notes with concern the delivery by Russia of sophisticated anti-aircraft capabilities for the benefit of the Syrian regime,"" Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von Der Muhll told reporters in an online briefing.

""Amid regional tensions, the delivery of such equipment by Russia contributes to maintaining the risk of military escalation and removing the prospect of a political settlement of the Syrian crisis,"" she said.

For the first time in decades, this year's line-up of Nobel prizes does not feature a literature award after a rape scandal saw a string of members resign or withdraw from the Academy's work in protest, leaving it unable to decide on a winner.
The Academy said in a statement it had appointed Eric Runesson, a Swedish supreme court judge, and Iranian-born novelist and poet Jila Mossaed as new members.
There had been calls for the resignation of Academy member Katarina Frostenson, who is married to the man at the center of the scandal, but the issue was not mentioned in the statement.
Her husband Jean-Claude Arnault was sentenced to two years in prison for rape on Monday. He has denied all allegations against him and is appealing the verdict.
The head of the Nobel Foundation told Reuters last week it could drop the Academy from awarding the literature prize if it did not make further changes in the wake of the scandal.
The Academy's handling of the row prompted two of its 18 members to resign and several others to cease taking part in the Academy's work, including Frostenson.
With the headcount falling as low as 10 and statutes demanding at least 12 for important votes, such as for electing new members, some of those who have ceased working at the Academy agreed to take part in the vote to fill vacant seats.
It remains short six working members, though only two of them have formally resigned.

Five months since a parliamentary election, Lebanese politicians remain unable to agree on how to share out ministerial portfolios in the new unity government that Hariri is trying to form.
Hariri said on Thursday the new government, expected to comprise 30 ministers, would be formed within a week to 10 days because the economy could not tolerate further delay. He called on all sides to make concessions.
But Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) leader Gebran Bassil, in a televised news conference on Friday, stuck by his demand that the FPM bloc get six portfolios in the new government. The FPM is the biggest Christian party in parliament.
Bassil, currently foreign minister in the caretaker government and a political ally of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, also gave no ground in demanding a separate share of five cabinet seats for President Michel Aoun, the FPM's founder and Bassil's father-in-law.
His comments signaled no compromise with the Lebanese Forces party, Lebanon's second largest Christian party and a staunch opponent of Hezbollah. Bassil said the LF should get three cabinet posts, based on the legislative election result.
The LF, which nearly doubled its MPs in the election, says it is entitled to a third of the Christian representation in government. The competing demands of the LF and FPM are seen as the biggest obstacle to an agreement. 

Lebanese officials are warning the heavily indebted state faces economic crisis. The IMF wants to see immediate and substantial fiscal adjustment to improve the sustainability of Lebanon's public debt, which stood at over 150 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2017.

Gruevski was sentenced in May after a trial heard he had used his influence over a member of the tender commission to promote one car dealer to supply the Mercedes. Gruevski received a kickback from the dealer, prosecutors said.
The case is the first of five against Gruevski brought by a special prosecutor appointed to investigate corruption allegations against the former government as part of an agreement among political parties brokered by the European Union. 
The court said on Friday the ex-prime minister's appeal was ""unfounded"". The start of his prison term is pending a court order. 
""This is a classical political persecution,"" Gruevski told reporters after the ruling was announced on Friday. 
Macedonia was thrown into political turmoil in 2015 when opposition parties accused the prime minister and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people.
Gruevski, the former leader of the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party, stepped down as prime minister in 2016 after 10 years in power. His departure and new elections were part of the EU agreement between his ruling VMRO-DPMNE and opposition parties.
Macedonia's hopes of joining the EU and NATO have been in limbo since a referendum on Sunday on changing the country's name to the ""Republic of North Macedonia"".

Voters backed a plan to change the name and so end a long dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's entry into the international organizations. But the referendum failed to achieve the 50 percent turnout required for the result to be valid.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India agreed a deal with Russia to buy S-400 surface to air missile systems on Friday, the two sides said, as New Delhi disregarded U.S. warnings that such a purchase could trigger sanctions under U.S. law.
Although there was no public signing, the deal was sealed during President Vladimir Putin's ongoing visit to New Delhi for an annual summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""The deal was signed on the fringes of the summit,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters. The contract is estimated to be worth more than $5 billion and gives the Indian military the ability to shoot down aircraft and missiles at unprecedented ranges. 
The United States has said countries trading with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors would face automatic sanctions under a sweeping legislation called Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
A State Department spokesperson said this week that the implementation of the sanctions act would be focused at countries acquiring weapons such as the S-400 missile batteries.
Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on China's military for its purchase of combat fighters as well as the S-400 missile system it bought from Russia this year.
India is hoping that President Donald Trump's administration will give it a waiver on the weapons systems which New Delhi sees as a deterrent against China's bigger and superior military.
""The (two) sides welcomed the conclusion of the contract for the supply of S-400 long range surface to air missile system to India,"" India and Russia said in a joint statement at the end of the talks. 
The two countries also signed eight agreements covering space, nuclear energy and railways at a televised news conference. ""We always arrive to India with great pleasure as we know that we are surrounded here in the environment of very frank friendship, business cooperation,"" Putin said. 
Russia will also help India in its plans to mount a manned space mission by 2022. 
""India gives the highest priority to ties with Russia, in fact in a changing world, our ties have become more important,"" Modi said.

For all the warm words, ties with Moscow are a lot less central to Delhi than they were during the Cold War years, as India has diversified arms purchases, closing $15 billion of deals with the United States over the last decade.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 07:46AM ET</span>",South African finance minister says he deeply regrets Gupta meetings,"By Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene apologized on Friday for visiting the home of the Gupta brothers - friends of scandal-plagued former leader Jacob Zuma - as pressure mounts on one of President Cyril Ramaphosa's key allies.
Nene has become an increasingly divisive figure after testimony he gave at an inquiry into allegations of corruption by the Guptas on Wednesday left some commentators describing him as a ""hero"", while his detractors called for his resignation. 
Nene told the inquiry that he was fired by Zuma for blocking deals that would have benefited the Guptas, particularly a $100 billion nuclear power deal with Russia that could have crippled Africa's most developed economy.
Some political analysts praised Nene for refusing to bow to the wishes of Zuma and his powerful business allies.
However, Nene also revealed for the first time that he had held several meetings with the Guptas at their home in Johannesburg, a confession his opponents said tarnished his anti-graft credentials.
The Guptas brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - have been accused of using their ties with Zuma to siphon off billions of rand in state funds and of inappropriately influencing cabinet appointments. Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing.
Nene said he never helped the Guptas. 
""I was wrong in meeting the Guptas at their residence and not in my office or at least a public place,"" Nene said in a statement, adding that he should have disclosed the meetings earlier.
""These visits do cast a shadow on my conduct as a public office bearer. I deeply regret these lapses and beg your forgiveness.""
""MONUMENTAL DISASTER""
Nene said in the statement he visited the Gupta family residence between 2010 and 2014, when he was deputy finance minister and later finance minister. Zuma fired Nene in December 2015, but Ramaphosa re-appointed him finance minister in February this year.
""It's a monumental disaster and doesn't cast him in a good light at all. Whether he takes a leap forward and decides to resign is unlikely,"" said political analyst Khaya Sithole.
Nene's opponents, including the radical opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), say he was involved in corrupt deals with the Guptas when he was deputy finance minister and head of the state pension fund. The EFF has called for his resignation.
Nene was the highest profile figure to give evidence at the probe into alleged influence-peddling by the Gupta family.
""Nene has managed to put some blue water between him and the Guptas but he is in an awkward position,"" said Daniel Silke, director of Political Futures Consultancy.

""This coming clean is a positive signal. But government does need to show a sustained commitment to transparency and a commitment to cleaning up governance.""

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",A disciple of Brazil's dictatorship moves closer to the presidency,"By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - In 1993, Congressman Jair Bolsonaro strode to a podium in Brazil's lower house and delivered a speech that shook its young democracy: He declared his love for the country's not-so-distant military regime and demanded the legislature be disbanded.
""Yes, I'm in favor of a dictatorship!"" Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, thundered at fellow lawmakers, some of whom had joined guerrilla groups to battle the junta that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. ""We will never resolve grave national problems with this irresponsible democracy!"" 
On Sunday, Brazilians will cast ballots in a presidential election that could elevate Bolsonaro to the head of the world's fifth most populous country. A political gadfly who has flitted through nine minor parties in a 27-year career, his views have changed little since that day in the capital of Brasilia.
But his jeremiad message – that Brazil is a dysfunctional basket case that needs an iron-fisted ruler to restore order – is resonating with Brazilians dispirited by the nation's soaring crime, moribund economy and entrenched political corruption.
Violent criminals? Bolsonaro says shoot them all. Political enemies? Them too. Corruption? A military coup will drain the swamp if the judicial system won't, he says. The economy? Bolsonaro wants to privatize state-run companies to keep politicians away from the till.
MOMENTUM IN THE POLLS
The 63-year-old is surging. He leads a crowded field of 13 candidates heading into the first round of elections on Oct. 7 with 35 percent of likely votes, according to the latest survey by polling firm Datafolha. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will go head-to-head on Oct. 28. Pollsters give Bolsonaro a roughly 30-percent chance of winning the race outright this weekend; some say privately his chances might be even better than that.
If there is a second round, Bolsonaro's opponent is likely to be Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party. Datafolha shows them tied in a potential runoff.
Many Brazilians are sounding alarms about Bolsonaro's autocratic views and those of his vice-presidential running mate, recently retired Army general Hamilton Mourao, who says Brazil's Constitution can be torn up and rewritten without input from citizens.
Then there are the federal hate speech charges leveled against Bolsonaro for his racist, homophobic and misogynist rants. His highlight reel includes a spat with a congresswoman whom Bolsonaro said was not attractive enough for him to rape.
Bolsonaro's campaign did not respond to Reuters' requests for an interview.
But supporters insist that tens of millions of Brazilians are silently rooting for Bolsonaro, even if some will not admit it to friends or pollsters.
Brazilians from all walks of life applaud his vow to make life miserable for armed gangs that have made them prisoners in their own homes. Many welcome his promise to loosen gun laws so average citizens can protect themselves. Business people like his recent embrace of free-market economics.
Young people are enthralled by his caustic put-downs of rivals on social media. Polls show Bolsonaro is performing well with female voters, despite being labeled a misogynist by many.
Evangelical Christians, who comprise a quarter of the electorate, are particularly enamored of Bolsonaro, a Catholic who has promised to rid schools of sex education, derail gay rights and thwart any attempts to loosen strict abortion laws. Some see his recent survival of a near-fatal knife attack on the campaign trail as a sign that Bolsonaro, whose middle name Messias means ""Messiah,"" was sent by God to lead them.
Others view him as the only option to prevent the return to power of the Workers Party, or PT, whose founder, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva, is serving a 12-year prison sentence for graft and money laundering.
Teenager Gilson Barbosa Silva, who hails from a tough district of Sao Paulo, says his disgust with the PT is such that he will begrudgingly vote for Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party.
""The options are depressing … (but) he is the only fresh option,"" the heavily tattooed 18-year-old said.
Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Sao Paulo business school, said Bolsonaro has deftly capitalized on polarization that has deepened with Lula's downfall.
""The roots of his support are in the political radicalization that has flourished in Brazil,"" Melo said. ""Jair Bolsonaro is a symbol of this transition.""
FROM MILITARY TO POLITICS
Some pundits call Bolsonaro a ""Tropical Trump"" because of his large social media following, pugnacious demeanor and multiple wives. Steve Bannon, the U.S. president's campaign guru, has likewise advised Bolsonaro.
But longtime political observers of Brazil – where full democracy has been the exception to a succession of authoritarian regimes in the last century – say Bolsonaro is a unique creation raised in the long shadow of the country's most recent dictatorship. 
Bolsonaro celebrated his ninth birthday just days before the 1964 coup. The son of an untrained dentist, he opted for the military and in 1977 graduated from the Black Needles Military Academy, Brazil's equivalent of West Point.
His Army career was undistinguished. Bolsonaro landed in the brig for a couple of weeks in 1986 after a Brazilian news magazine published his complaints about paltry military pay. But his words tapped into widespread discontent among rank-and-file soldiers. He parlayed that support into a seat on Rio de Janeiro's city council in 1988, then a spot in Congress two years later.
Bolsonaro's legislative achievements are thin: He has authored just two bills that became law. Still, he has never been tarnished by corruption.
Now, after nearly three decades in politics, Bolsonaro is riding a tsunami of voter frustration that may carry him to the presidency.
Brazil is still hobbling from its worst recession in decades; 13 million are unemployed. Crime has exploded and drug violence has touched every corner of the country. Last year saw nearly 64,000 murders, the most on record. The epic bribery investigation that jailed Lula exposed a pay-to-play political culture of staggering proportions.
Disgust with Brazil's leaders is palpable. Only 13 percent of Brazilians are ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with democracy overall, according to the most recent annual poll by Latinobarometro, a Chilean think tank.
That toxic environment has Bolsonaro's backers, much like U.S. voters who sent Donald Trump to the White House, hoping he will be a walking grenade that explodes the system from within.
""If he can lessen graft and get rid of the old, corrupt foxes who rule our political system, then four years from now we will have more candidates who put Brazil's interests above their own,"" said Raphael Enohata, a 26-year-old graduate engineering student at the University of Sao Paulo. ""He is just the beginning of the transition we want.""
Drug gangs are also high on Bolsonaro's hit list.
""We cannot treat criminals like normal human beings who need to be respected,"" Bolsonaro said in August. He said law enforcement should pump suspects with ""10, 15 or 30"" bullets each, then ""be given awards"" for their efforts.
A few days later at a rally, Bolsonaro grabbed a cameraman's tripod and mimicked shooting a rifle. ""We are going to gun down all these Workers Party supporters!"" he shouted as the crowd cheered wildly.
His campaign said it was a joke. But Bolsonaro is serious about what he sees as his destiny.

""God called me to this race,"" he said upon accepting his party's nomination. ""My mother gave me the middle name Messiah. But I alone will not be the savior of the Brazil. Who will save it is all of us, together.""

The Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt endorsed a lower court's decision to reject an appeal by Armin Meiwes to have his life sentence converted into a suspended sentence.
In a tale that horrified Germany, Meiwes found his victim, Bernd-Juergen Brandes, over the Internet. Brandes, an IT manager, had posted an advert for someone to ""obliterate his life and leave no trace"".
Brandes traveled by train to meet Meiwes in the western town of Rotenburg in March 2001. There, Meiwes videotaped himself severing Brandes' penis with a knife before both men tried to eat it.
Bleeding profusely, Brandes fell unconscious. With the video recorder still rolling, Meiwes laid him out on a bench, kissing him on the lips before plunging a knife into his throat.
The Frankfurt court said its ruling may not be appealed.
It was asked to review a decision by a lower court in Kassel to reject Meiwes' appeal for a suspended sentence, arguing that experts had advised he was not fit for life outside prison.
He suspended the victim on a meat hook and froze 30 kg of flesh in parcels and later ate some with cabbage and potatoes.
A German court had initially convicted Meiwes of manslaughter and sentenced him to eight years in jail in 2004.
But in 2006 a Frankfurt court overturned that conviction and threw out the defense argument that Meiwes had acted on his victim’s request, a crime similar to euthanasia which in Germany carries a maximum prison term of five years.
That Frankfurt court had said Meiwes was psychologically ill but fully aware of his actions. 
In October 2008, the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, Germany's top court, ruled that Meiwes must serve a life sentence for murder.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez faces growing pressure from within his Socialist Party to call an early election, before scandals besetting his four-month-old minority government undermine a surge in voter support.
Riding high in the polls, Sanchez aims to serve a full term to mid-2020 as he focuses on approving next year's budget and countering renewed independence moves in the Catalonia region.
But last week his science minister was forced to deny media reports he cheated on his taxes, days after a recording emerged of the justice minister using a homophobic slur. 
Two other ministers have already been pushed out, one over a report she plagiarized her university degree, and a second over a 10-year-old tax fine. Both denied wrongdoing.
""This was not in the script,"" a top party official said on condition of anonymity. ""There is no consensus in the party on what we should do.""
The official and a second Socialist party source said some of its senior members, fearful the scandals are beginning to alienate voters, were lobbying Sanchez to go to the polls now to shore up his government while he still can.
The Socialists control fewer than a quarter of parliamentary seats but, according to a poll published last month, lead their nearest rivals - the conservative People's Party (PP) - by around 10 percentage points. 
MORE UNCERTAINTY FOR EU? 
A snap election would add to political uncertainty in the European Union at a time when Britain is about to leave and populist parties across the continent campaigning for European Parliament elections are advocating a weakening of the bloc's structures.
Spanish elections would also be likely to reignite debate over Catalonia's secession ambitions, a further potential headache for advocates of closer EU unity.
On the domestic front, the controversies over his cabinet team are particularly embarrassing for Sanchez, given he came to power on the back of a corruption scandal, ousting former PP leader Mariano Rajoy with a no-confidence motion in June.
The sources said the negative publicity could complicate Sanchez's efforts to pass the 2019 budget, which Catalonia's pro-independence leader would scupper if he made good on a threat to withdraw the support of national MPs aligned with him. 
Sanchez, who has ruled out any moves toward independence by the wealthy northeast region, told Reuters in an interview last month that wrangling over Catalonia could cut short his administration.
The government has indicated that, to avoid a parliamentary standoff, it might abandon its own budget and stick to the one laid out by Rajoy, but analysts say any stalemate over finances could equally provide an excuse to call an election.
""Sanchez needs a reason to bring the election forward that distances him from the scandals about the ministers,"" said Pablo Simon, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III university.
If the September poll were translated into parliamentary seats, the Socialists, while still in a minority, would be in pole position to form a ruling coalition or another minority government.
But without a budget crisis to peg it on, bringing forward the vote could have a political cost. 
""Calling elections is a sign of weakness,"" said Narciso Michavila, director of polling firm GAD3.

If Sanchez keeps going to 2019, another big test awaits with municipal elections in May.

EKONA, Cameroon (Reuters) - A unit of Cameroon's special forces edged up the winding main road of what used to be a functioning village, past the rusted shell of a burnt-out lorry loaded with smashed beer bottles, past an abandoned church and a shuttered bar. 
Ekona's thousands of residents have fled fighting between the army and separatist militias in the Southwest region in recent weeks, leaving behind the only testimony they could: squat, tin-roofed houses gutted by fire, power lines strewn on overgrown verges and, above all, silence.
""It is weird. There used to be shops here, it used to be normal,"" said Captain Guy Herve Onambele, surveying the wreckage from his jeep protected by military trucks full of soldiers.
""The separatists used to come here and hide. A lot of people from the area joined the secessionists.""
Army officials generally play down the impact that a year-old armed secessionist insurgency has had in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions and say that an offensive this year has pushed back the threat. Yet on Thursday, soldiers from Cameroon's Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR), sporting full combat gear, vigilantly scanned Ekona's roadsides for threats, their automatic rifles raised. 
Residents in the area are not convinced either. 
SHELTER
In the weeks preceding Sunday's presidential elections, towns and villages in the region have been drained of life as thousands seek shelter in the French-speaking cities of Douala and Yaounde.
Armed separatists have vowed to stop the election in English-speaking areas, potentially disenfranchising about one in five voters and, ironically, helping President Paul Biya, who heads a Francophone-dominated government, extend his 36 years in power.
In the once thriving city of Buea, 10 km (6 miles) from Ekona, most stores are closed on the order of separatists who want to shut down all activity in the region as part of their bid to halt the polls there. Those that do not close risk the ire of the insurgents. 
The bus station, normally a busy hub for surrounding villages, is empty, its muddy lot filled with litter. Bullet casings are scattered at the scene of recent firefights. Old fires have scarred the tarmac of the now quiet streets. 
""You can see for yourself,"" said 29-year-old clothes seller Diale Florence in the Mile 16 area of Buea, gesturing at an upturned car in a puddle, burned white after an attack three weeks ago that the army says was orchestrated by separatists.
""Everyone has left.""
""FRYING POPCORN""
Buea, the Southwest region's spacious, green capital, sits on the eastern flank of Mount Cameroon, a volcano which rises from the rubber and banana plantations of the plains high above the dense treeline before being lost in rings of lowering cloud. 
The sight used to attract tourists from across the world. Then the Anlgophone crisis hit. Protests calling for better treatment of the English-speaking regions by the French-speaking majority in 2016 were shut down by the military. The movement became radicalized after civilian deaths and armed groups calling for separation emerged. 
The plantations are now emptied out, leaving bananas to rot on the trees. Cassava, potatoes and corn are wasting unharvested in the farms, local residents said. 
Since 2016, Buea's population has fallen from 200,000 people to about 10,000 today, said local traditional chief Derick Woteva Wambo. 
""The schools have been closed for two years, the children are at home,"" said Wambo. That includes his seven-year-old daughter who is so used to the sound of gunfire that she says it sounds like the fighters are ""frying popcorn again"". 
Wambo has become accustomed to violence too. At 6:30 on the morning of Sept. 27, he received a call saying the military had shot some suspected separatist fighters in a nearby house. The army denies this. 
When he arrived an hour later, he entered the house to find six young men, one in a chair, another slumped behind a door, all shot dead. A seventh man had been taken away, he said. 
And yet, after a year of trauma, he took in the scene with little emotion. 

""For me it was normal,"" Wambo said. "" I have seen this before.""

On the last day of campaigning, final opinion polls ahead of Sunday's vote are likely to show the most polarized election in a generation going to a run-off vote between Bolsonaro and leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad.
""This is wrong. Bolsonaro is avoiding his duty to the population. Anyone who hides from debate and does not show up lacks the qualities needed to govern a country,"" said former finance minister Henrique Meirelles, who is running for the ruling MDB party.
In an interview with TV Record that is owned by a supporter, evangelical Christian bishop and media mogul Edir Macedo, Bolsonaro slammed his rival for being a ""puppet"" of jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, was confirmed as top of the Workers Party ticket three weeks ago, replacing Lula, who was barred from running due to a corruption conviction.
Earlier, in a live speech over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Bolsonaro rejected accusations he was racist, sexist and homophobic, though he has faced charges for hate speech against these groups.
The former army captain has surged in the election, even though his party is very small, because he has tapped into the anger of Brazilians with rampant political corruption and rising crime.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, is running on a law-and-order platform and would ease gun controls so Brazilians can arm themselves against criminals.
He has won massive support from the fast-growing evangelical community by vowing to block the legalization of abortion, gay marriage and drugs.
Brazilian markets have rallied on the prospect of Bolsonaro stopping a return to power by the Workers Party, which investors blame for plunging Brazil into its worst recession in 2015-2016.

Yet Bolsonaro's economic positions remain unclear. Last week he asked his economic advisor Paulo Guedes and his running mate retired general Hamilton Mourão to hold off on making public statements after contradictions emerged over economic policy.

Abdul Raziq, the Kandahar police chief, said Taliban militants had mounted an attack in the Maroof district when security forces responded with an airstrike on Thursday.
""They (Taliban) tried to flee and got mixed up with villagers at a wedding procession. The airstrike killed four civilians, including women and children, and 10 Taliban militants,"" Raziq told Reuters.
Kandahar province, on the border with Pakistan, is a major center of opium cultivation and a stronghold of the Taliban.
Taliban insurgents often hide in civilian homes after staging attacks on government targets and use civilians as human shields to escape.
Afghan officials said the incident was still being investigated and it was unclear whether the casualties had been caused by Afghan or U.S. aircraft, both of which flew missions in support of the operation.

A High Court judge said in the ruling that Diane Rwigara and her mother, who was arrested along with her last year, would be released immediately but that they were not allowed to leave the capital Kigali ""without authorization"".
As the judge read the ruling to the courtroom which was packed with diplomats, journalist and relatives of the two women who were wearing light pink prison uniforms, the room erupted into cheers and several people shouted ""Praise to God!"". 
Rwigara and her mother were jailed in October 2017 on charges of incitement and forgery that were widely seen as politically motivated. 
The 37-year-old businesswoman and activist has repeatedly accused Kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his Rwandan Patriotic Front's near total hold on power since it fought its way to office to end a genocide in 1994.

The court's ruling comes several weeks after Rwanda freed Victoire Ingabire, an opposition leader who had served six years of a 15-year jail term, after Kagame exercised his power to grant a pardon.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",EU negotiators see Brexit divorce deal 'very close': sources,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's Brexit negotiators see a divorce deal with Britain as ""very close"", diplomatic sources said, a signal that a compromise might be in the making on the most contentious issue of the future Irish border. 
The EU signaled on Thursday it was engaging with new proposals emerging in Britain on avoiding extensive Irish border checks after Brexit, a potential deal-breaker in the unprecedented talks to end Britain's four decades in the bloc.
A member of EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's team told a briefing with national diplomats in Brussels late on Thursday that a divorce deal with Britain was ""very close"", according to two sources at the meeting. 
Their comments sent sterling to a 10-week high versus the euro.
The two sides are trying to push the divorce deal as well as an agreement on post-Brexit relations above the line in time for two leaders' summits scheduled for Oct. 17-18 and Nov. 17-18. 
Under the plan in the making, the EU would get assurances that the emergency Irish border fix would be indefinite, while Britain would get its way in having all of the United Kingdom - rather than just Northern Ireland - stay in a customs union with the bloc should the border 'backstop' be triggered.
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, speaking in Brussels on Thursday, has stressed no new proposals have been made on paper and that they should come well ahead of the EU summit in less than two weeks to leave enough time for analysis.
Sources in Brussels say the devil is in the detail. 
Such a compromise would leave the EU worrying that Britain could use Northern Ireland's special access to the bloc's single market to sell cheaper goods that would not adhere to labor, environment and other standards. 
The bloc worries that London would use whatever special trade fix is agreed for Northern Ireland as a building block for the overall future trade relationship to win an unfair competitive edge.
CANADA +++
One senior EU diplomat said the bloc could seek to attach additional conditions to any such agreement but they have not yet been specified. 
For Britain, the problem is agreeing to checks on goods and livestock with Northern Ireland, something the province's Democratic Unionist Party - on which British Prime Minister Theresa May relies to govern - strongly opposes.
Britain's Brexit ministry said on Friday London's new proposals on the Irish border would preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom.
While the EU is pushing London on the Irish conundrum, the 27 states remaining in the bloc are also fleshing out their proposal of future ties with Britain. A member of Barnier's team was due to present his outline to 27 EU ambassadors in Brussels later on Friday. 
The chairman of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, on Thursday said a ""Canada +++"" was on offer, meaning an advanced free trade agreement coupled with close security ties and tight cooperation on global affairs, among others. 
Another senior EU diplomat said the EU would propose ""zero tariffs and zero quotas"" in trade with Britain after Brexit, which would go beyond what the bloc has with Canada.
Such a proposal goes down well with May's critics at home who advocate a more uncompromising cut from the EU than she is seeking. For the bloc, however, the Irish emergency break would still be an essential part of any such offer. 

Any deal between May and fellow EU leaders must be endorsed by both the EU and British parliaments, another hurdle to clear to avoid the most damaging scenario of Britain leaving the bloc with not much in place to mitigate the economic shock.

The ministry had urged the FCC to withdraw its invitation to Andy Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, which was formally banned by Hong Kong authorities last month.
It was the first outlawing of a political organization since Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Nigerian opposition to pick presidential candidate as northwest takes center stage,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's main opposition party, which this weekend selects its candidate to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari in an election in February, is aiming to make his northwestern power base a main battleground in the contest.
To do so, however, it needs to secure the backing of powerful figures in the northwest and to ensure the party does not fracture over its choice of candidate, analysts said.
Many of the 13 candidates for the People's Democratic Party (PDP) nomination defected from Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in recent months. 
Seven have ties with states in the northwest, mostly as current or past governors, bolstering the party in a traditional Buhari stronghold. 
At stake in the primary election is the chance to face him in a presidential contest which will determine who controls a country that is Africa's top oil producer, has one of the continent's biggest economies, and plays a key role in regional wars against Islamist insurgents. 
The northwest, the most densely populated region in the country of 190 million people, is shaping up to take center stage in the race.
""In past elections, Buhari got almost half of his vote from the northwest and the region will be even more important this time,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
""A lot of people from other regions who voted for Buhari first-time in 2015 are likely to turn their back on him.""
The region is traditionally the center of the Muslim voter base as Nigeria's three most senior Islamic leaders - the sultan of Sokoto, the emir of Kano and the emir of Gwando - are based there.
Buhari, a northern Muslim, who won the 2015 election at the fourth attempt, took 1.9 million votes in Kano state compared to 215,779 secured by Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner.
An unofficial agreement aimed at rotating power between the mainly Muslim north and mostly Christian south, means a northern candidate is likely to be selected by the opposition. 
The northerners in the primary contest include the governor of northwestern Sokoto state Aminu Tambuwal, former Kano governor Ibrahim Shekarau, ex-Kaduna governor Ahmed Makarfi, and former Sokoto governor Attahiru Bafarawa. 
""Assuming that the PDP remains united, this could put them back on the map in the northwest, a region where the party scored on average merely 16 percent in 2015,"" Teneo's Liewerscheidt said.
PDP national publicity secretary Kola Ologbondiyan dismissed the suggestion that supporters of unsuccessful candidates may not back the person selected.
""We are all going to work together to ensure the victory of our candidate,"" he said.
The dent in Buhari's popularity can largely be attributed to the economy.
Nigeria entered its first recession in 25 years in 2016, mainly caused by lower oil prices and attacks in the Niger Delta crude production region.
It emerged from recession early last year but growth remains sluggish and inflation has remained high, above the central bank's single digit target range. 
The impact of the economic downturn of recent years is, for some on the streets of the north's commercial hub Kano, a reason to reject Buhari.
""Everything went back under Buhari, there's no progress or development,"" said Yusuf Yakubu, who left Buhari's party in June 2017 and joined the PDP.
""If you go to the market, the traders will tell you the economy has collapsed under this administration. There is really nothing Kano can hold up and say 'This is how we've benefited under Buhari',"" he said. 
But many others on the streets of the city felt that the president, who is from the neighboring state of Katsina, should be given a second term. 
""Perhaps we all would not be in Kano state by now if not for his administration. Maybe, we would have all been chased out of this state by Boko Haram,"" said Abdullmuminu Gezewa, praising the government's security record.

Footage on private broadcaster Channel 10 showed police investigators entering Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem. Police and the prime minister's office declined to comment.
Army Radio said the focus on Friday would be on two cases in which police have recommended indictments against him.

No charges have been brought against the Israeli leader, who denies any wrongdoing and has called the allegations baseless. 
It will be up to Israel's attorney general to decide whether to file charges. Partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition have stood by him, saying they are awaiting the attorney general's next moves.

Netanyahu has also been questioned in a third case in which police allege that the owners of Israel’s largest telecom company provided favorable coverage of him and his wife on a news website they controlled in return for special treatment favors from communications regulators.

Oleg Sentsov, who says his conviction was politically-motivated, has been on hunger strike since May in protest over Russia's human rights record and his case has been taken up by politicians and writers in the West who say he was unjustly jailed and should be freed.
A native of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula who opposed the region's annexation by Russia in 2014, Sentsov has been jailed for planning terrorist attacks, which he denies.
""Oleg Sentsov has ended his hunger strike,"" the TASS news agency cited Valery Maksimenko, the deputy head of Russia's prison service, as saying. ""He had agreed to start eating.""
Maksimenko was quoted as saying that diet experts were working with Sentsov, who has lost considerable weight, to ensure he started eating in a way that would allow him to make a return to full health.
A Russian military court sentenced Sentsov to 20 years in a maximum security prison in 2015 after finding him guilty of setting fire to two offices in Crimea, including one belonging to Russia's ruling political party. Sentsov was also convicted of plotting to blow up a statue.

Sentsov, 42, pleaded not guilty at the time and denounced his trial as politically motivated. The European Union said the case was ""in breach of international law"" and the U.S. State Department called it a ""clear miscarriage of justice"".

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is likely to skip an international fleet review in South Korea next week, Japanese media on Friday, after Seoul asked Tokyo to reconsider flying its ""Rising Sun"" flag on a warship, the latest spat over the countries' colonial history.
Japan's relations with both South and North Korea have long been strained by lingering resentment over its colonization of the peninsula, territorial rows and the issue of girls and women forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that Japan's defense ministry was considering whether to take part, but public broadcaster NHK said Tokyo had already told Seoul it was unlikely to do so. 
Many people in both Koreas see the red-and-white flag as a symbol of Japan’s past military aggression and its colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. 
""The 'Rising Sun' flag is a war-crime flag that the 20th-century Japanese imperialists used when executing their barbaric invasions into our nation and other Asian nations,"" North Korea's state-controlled Uriminjokkiri website said.
""Planning to enter flying the 'Rising Sun' flag is an unbearable insult and ridicule to our people.""
In South Korea, articles about the controversy are among the most widely read on social media, with the president's office receiving 250 petitions for the Japanese ship to be barred. 
On Friday, the South Korean Navy said Japanese naval ships flew the ensign when they participated in fleet reviews in 1998 and 2008, but it had asked all ships at this year's event to display national flags and the South Korean flag. 
The ""Rising Sun"" ensign, used by the Japanese Imperial Navy in campaigns around Asia and the Pacific before and during World War Two, was adopted by the Maritime Self-Defence Force in 1954.
Variations of the flag are used by the Ground Self-Defence Force and on the fatigues of some Japanese sailors, but some South Koreans liken it to Nazi symbols such as the swastika.
Japanese officials had signaled the flag would be flown, despite the protests. 
""Hoisting of the Maritime Self-Defence Force ensign is required by law,"" Katsutoshi Kawano, the chief of staff of the Self Defence Forces, told reporters on Thursday.
""Members take pride in the ensign, and we will never go there with the flag unhoisted."" 
South Korea's foreign ministry had ""conveyed our stance that the Japanese side should fully consider the Rising Sun flag's emotional connotation to our people,"" Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said. 
Japan is a key player in United States-led efforts to isolate and punish North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
But it has remained a major target of criticism, despite warming ties between Pyongyang and Seoul as the North's leader Kim Jong Un engaged in a flurry of diplomacy this year, when he also met leaders of the United States and China.

Japan and South Korea often trade barbs over disputed islands known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korea.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","In Macau, Portuguese elites feel squeezed out by Chinese influence","MACAU (Reuters) - Nearly 20 years have passed since Portugal handed Macau over to China, and although colonial culture still infuses parts of daily life, the influence of the territory's Portuguese elite is declining rapidly as the special administrative region becomes increasingly closer to mainland China. 
Authorities say they want the world's largest gambling hub to diversify into a trade and business center for Portuguese-speaking countries including Brazil, Portugal and Angola, but there is a gaping disconnect, Portuguese residents say.
Two Portuguese top legal advisers, renowned for their expertise and training of local judges and prosecutors, were abruptly dismissed in August, far ahead of retirement age. And legislation this year proposed Portuguese judges should be removed from sensitive cases altogether. 
""They say everywhere that Portuguese are part of Macau and are always welcome, part of the history. In fact, what they are doing is not what they are saying,"" said Alvaro Rodrigues, a lawyer in Macau. 
The removal of Paulo Taipa and Paulo Cardinal, both of whom served for more than 20 years in the government, is a bad signal, said Rodrigues, who came to Macau 28 years ago from Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony in Africa. 
The head of Macau's legislature, Ho Iat Seng, who orchestrated their dismissal, said in September it was because of ""restructuring.""
Ho has been touted as a candidate for Macau's chief executive in 2019. Ho and Macau's Legislative Assembly office did not respond to requests for comment. 
""Both of the jurists have for the past few years been openly criticizing the Macau government and stating that many of the laws that the Legislative Assembly pass violate the Basic Law,"" said assembly member Jose Coutinho.
For example, he said, a law on government salaries runs afoul of the Basic Law by discriminating against low-level civil servants.
Like neighboring Hong Kong, Macau operates under China's ""one country, two systems"" policy. Its Basic Law is supposed to allow a high degree of autonomy and greater liberties like a free press and an independent judiciary. 
The legal system is broadly based on Portugal's. But influence from the Chinese mainland is squeezing it, experts said, in an accelerated version of the scenes unfolding in Hong Kong.
""We can feel it. If you look to the legislation that has been passed in recent years, we understand that there is a big influence from the first system (China) on the second system (Macau),"" said Pedro Cortes, a lawyer in Macau.
Jorge Neto Valente, head of the Macau's Lawyers Association, said freezing out Portuguese judges violated the Basic Law and created a sort of patriotism test based on their feelings toward China.
And in the business community, many worry about increasing interference - an issue that could hurt the casino industry. Casino executives say they are closely watching what official policy will be as their licenses begin to expire in 2020.
CHINESE REALISM
These days, the only real remaining elements of Portuguese influence are colonial architecture and its distinctive cuisine.
Portuguese and Chinese are both official languages in Macau, but there are signs that Chinese is being prioritized in government. 
There are no longer any Portuguese judges in Macau's criminal court, and they account for around 10 percent of the city-state's 49 jurists. 
Courts have largely stopped providing Portuguese translations. During the trial of Sulu Sou, Macau's youngest lawmaker, and Scott Chiang on charges of aggravated disobedience their lawyers, Jorge Menezes and Pedro Leal, were denied translation of a 66-page Chinese ruling.
The judge said Sou and Chiang ""took the risk"" of hiring Portuguese lawyers and should have considered language when making their decision.
Experts said the government was increasingly hiring only Chinese for jobs as lawyers, advisers and jurists.
Rita Assis Ferreira, a lawyer in Portugal and representative of PLMJ Law Firm in Macau, said this was part of a long-term government plan to promote Chinese policies after the handover.
""I don’t see this as bad or dramatic; it's what we agreed 20 years ago with China mainland,"" she said. 
José Luis de Sales Marques, Macau's mayor from 1993 to 2001, who now heads Macau's Institute of European Studies, was also more optimistic. He said the government supported the teaching of Portuguese, despite closer assimilation to the mainland's laws and administration. 

""We have to see that there is this formula 'One Country, Two Systems' and the real meaning of that ... is one country,"" he said. ""This is the kind of realism that we have to have.""

Rumors of Duterte's health woes re-emerged after the 73-year-old president, known for a busy schedule and long speeches, missed two official events on Wednesday, including a meeting with the cabinet. 
In a televised speech Thursday night, Duterte told top security officials he went to a private hospital for a procedure as his doctors wanted to get more tissue samples.
He did not elaborate but said in the same speech: ""I will tell you if its cancer"".
""The result of the examination, whether or not it can be made public will depend on what they find out,"" Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque told a news briefing, citing a provision in the Philippine constitution on public disclosure of the president's health conditions. 
""The president is not inclined to hide anything about his health. I assure the public, the president will not hide anything. If it is serious, he will inform the nation.""
Under Philippine laws, if a sitting president dies in office, permanently disabled or removed through impeachment, the vice president succeeds to serve the remaining years in a six-year, single term.
Vice President Leni Robredo, a leader of the political opposition, was elected separately in 2016 and could fuel uncertainty in the succession process given the highly polarized political climate.
Roque said he was kept ""in the dark"" about the president's trip to a hospital, which he said was for an endoscopy procedure.
""Endoscopy was recommended, from his own words, because they wanted to be sure that there was a growth and they wanted to know more about the growth"", Roque said. ""That is the context of why he said 'if its cancer'"", he said.

Lee Myung-bak faced charges that he accepted around $10 million in illegal funds from institutions like Samsung and his own intelligence service, fuelling ongoing concerns over the cozy ties between government and business leaders. 
The Seoul Central District Court found Lee guilty of embezzlement of about 24.6 billion won ($21.77 million) from a private auto parts maker headed by his brother, and accepting bribes from Samsung and others, fining Lee 13 billion won in addition to the jail sentence. 
""Such actions from the president, the head of state and the leader of the executive branch, can be severely condemned as it does not stop at violating the fairness and integrity of the presidential office but undermines trust in the entire public office,"" judge Chung Kye-sun said. 
Lee, 76, has denied any wrongdoing, saying the investigation that led to the trial was politically motivated ""revenge"" by current President Moon Jae-in, who came to office vowing to clean house after the Park scandal and who has previously criticized Lee over an investigation into another former president, Roh Moo-hyun.
Moon served as Roh’s chief of staff, and the two liberal leaders had a close relationship before Roh committed suicide in 2009 after being questioned on corruption allegations during Lee’s presidency.
Lee was not in attendance at the verdict, which was televised live. Prosecutors had sought a 20-year sentence for Lee.

Erik Prince, whose company came to prominence during the war in Iraq, has been lobbying officials about his proposal to privatize parts of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan for more than a year.
On a recent visit to Kabul, he lobbied several Afghan political figures and gave interviews to media outlets including Tolo News, Afghanistan's largest television station, as well as the New York Times, to discuss the plan.
President Ashraf Ghani, approaching presidential elections in April, has repeatedly rejected the proposal and on Thursday his national security adviser issued a statement condemning what he called a ""destructive and divisive debate"".
""Under no circumstances will the Afghan government and people allow the counterterrorism fight to become a private, for-profit business,"" the statement said.
In August, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis also rebuffed the idea, saying: ""When Americans put their nation's credibility on the line, privatizing it is probably not a wise idea.""
Afghan officials say that any move to replace U.S military advisers with private contractors would further undermine government legitimacy and fuel Taliban accusations that the war was being conducted for the benefit of foreign interests.
Speaking half seriously, one senior security official said recently: ""If they did that, even I would join the Taliban"". 
Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL whose sister Betsy De Vos serves as Education Secretary in President Donald Trump's administration, would have retired Special Forces troops from the United States and allied nations embed with Afghan forces, replacing U.S. and NATO military advisers.
The plan was originally broached last year as Trump was considering a new strategy for Afghanistan but it was not adopted and instead, Washington ordered thousands more U.S. troops to be sent to boost existing forces.
The United States currently has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, serving in the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission as well as in separate counter-terrorism operations against militant groups like Islamic State.
Under the strategy announced just over a year ago, the extra troops and greatly increased air strikes against the Taliban are intended to force the insurgents to the negotiating table.
A brief ceasefire in June raised hopes of a possible breakthrough with the Taliban but progress towards any kind of peace deal has since been slow and fighting has continued with increasing Afghan military casualties, raising questions about the success of the strategy.

Trump has since been reported to be unhappy about the lack of progress, prompting fears among some diplomats that he could reverse course and order U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, a move that would risk a collapse of the Western-backed government.

The collision, which occurred at 5:50 p.m. (1530 GMT) on Thursday during peak rush hour travel, left 32 passengers with serious but not critical injuries.
""The injured commuters were taken for medical attention at various hospitals,"" Metrorail said in a statement.
""A board of enquiry will be instituted soon to determine the root cause of the accident.""
In January, a similar train accident on the outskirts of Johannesburg injured 200 people.
South Africa has the continent's largest railway network, but it has been plagued by mismanagement and under-investment that has seen train use dwindle despite it being the cheapest form of public transportation.
In a report, the government's Rail Safety Regulator said that, in the 2016/17 financial year, 495 people lost their lives on the country's railways and 2,079 were injured. The death toll was up 5 percent from the previous year.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court has jailed a 70-year-old barber for seven months over a violation of the country's royal insult law, the first such conviction since the law was adopted this year.
A court found Ban Samphy, 70, a member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), guilty on Thursday after he shared a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post about King Norodom Sihamoni in May, his daughter, Ang Vongpheak, 45, said. 
""He was sentenced to a year in prison for insulting the king but only seven months will be enforced,"" Yin Srang, a spokesman for the court in the northern province of Siem Reap, told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
In February, Cambodia's parliament unanimously adopted the law forbidding insults to the monarchy. Rights groups expressed concern at the time that the law, similar to one in neighboring Thailand, could be used against critics of the government.
Last year, the Supreme Court dissolved the opposition CNRP at the government's request. It was found guilty of plotting to take power with the help of the United States - an accusation the party has denied.
In July, the ruling party Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen won a general election that critics said was flawed because of a lack of a credible opposition, among other factors.
Ang Vongpheak expressed disappointment at Thursday's verdict.
""I'm not happy with the court decision but I don't know what we can do,"" she said.

Trade in ivory and pangolin is illegal in Vietnam, but wildlife trafficking remains widespread.
Police found more than two tonnes of ivory and six tonnes of pangolin scales hidden in a plastic waste container at Tien Sa port in the central Vietnamese city of Danang on Thursday, the government said in a statement.
The container, owned by Vietnam's Thien Truong Su Co., originated from Nigeria, according to the statement. Calls to Nguyen Xuan Su, the company's general director, went unanswered on Friday.
The raid came days after authorities at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi said they seized nearly a ton of ivory and pangolin scales hidden in cargo boxes, also sent from Nigeria.
Nguyen Van Thai, director of Save Vietnam's Wildlife said pangolin trafficking has been on the rise over recent years. 
""Most of pangolin scales seized in Vietnam originate from Africa and are bound for China, which is the bigger market"" Thai told Reuters, adding that part of the shipments were for the Vietnamese market.
Thai said some Vietnamese people believe that consuming ground pangolin scales is good for their health, particularly for issues with the liver, bones, and for mothers to produce milk for newborn babies.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Scouts Australia apologized on Friday to victims of sexual abuse in its organization after an official inquiry found widespread abuse in religious and state-run institutions.
The apology came in response to a five-year, government-appointed inquiry into child sexual abuse that delved into more than 8,000 cases of sexual misconduct.
""We failed you, and we apologize for the pain that this has caused,"" Scouts chief commissioner Phil Harrison said in a video message.
""It's a genuine and heartfelt admission that for some young people, their time in Scouting was a negative experience, and we are truly sorry for this,"" said Harrison.
Scouts Australia has more than 54,000 members under 18 years old.
The inquiry did not reveal the numbers of children harmed by Scouts Australia workers, but it heard evidence that a former scout leader in New South Wales state indecently assaulted two boys in the 1990s. He was convicted of the offences in 2013.
As well as offering an apology, Scouts Australia said it will adopt all recommendations from the inquiry, unlike the Catholic Church in Australia which said in August it would oppose a recommendation that priests be forced to report child abuse when they learn about it in confessional.
The Catholic Church has apologized to abuse victims and paid A$276 million ($276.00 million) in compensation to thousands of child abuse victims since 1980, the inquiry heard.
The Australian government this year established a redress scheme that offers abuse victims up to A$150,000. 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to deliver a rare national apology to abuse victims on behalf of the government later this month. 
In 2008, then Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized to members of the ""Stolen Generation"" of indigenous Australians, who were forcibly taken from their families and communities when they were young under assimilation policies.

The U.S. State Department called for the release Tomas Nunez Magdariaga, a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the island's largest dissident groups. 
He had been convicted on ""false charges and convicted ... in a sham trial"", it said.
UNPACU leader Jose Daniel Ferrer says Nunez was sentenced to a year in jail for allegedly making threats to a security agent - a charge the agent later recanted, according to Ferrer. 
""We understand his health is in a critical state, and that the authorities have denied his family the opportunity to see him,"" the State Department said in a statement.
The Cuban government has not commented publicly on the case and did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Havana considers all dissidents to be agents of the United States. It regularly detains them for a few hours or days, as part of what critics and human rights groups describe as a long-running campaign of harassment and repression.
In August, authorities accused Ferrer of attempting to run over a government official and arrested him but released him after 12 days.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - A week after a major earthquake brought devastation to Indonesia's Sulawesi island, Hasnah has trouble remembering all of the dead relatives she's trying to find in the tangled expanse of mud and debris that used to be her neighborhood.
Hasnah, 44, is from Petobo, a village on the southern outskirts of the city of Palu, where last Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a phenomenon called soil liquefaction, which turned the ground into a churning sea of mud.
""More than half of my family are gone,"" Hasnah told Reuters as she sobbed. ""I can’t even count how many. Two of my children are gone, my cousins, my sister, my brother in law and their children, all gone.""
The official death toll from the quake and tsunami it triggered stands at 1,558, but it will certainly rise as more bodies are recovered in Palu, where most of the dead have been counted.
Figures for more remote areas, some still cut off by destroyed roads and landslides, are only trickling in, if at all.
No one knows how many people were dragged to their deaths in the roiling quagmire in Petobo and nearby areas south of Palu, which were particularly hard hit by liquefaction.
The national disaster agency says 1,700 homes in one neighborhood alone were swallowed up and hundreds of people killed.
""I saw our homes being sucked into the earth. The earth was like a blender, blending everything in its way,” said Hasnah, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name.
""I’m lucky to be alive but I feel like I don’t want to be.""
Hasnah said she has sufficient food and water for now, but she's furious that a search and rescue operation in her area only began on Thursday.
""I’m so disappointed. They said they would come with the heavy machines but they didn’t. They lied.""

'DO IT OURSELVES'
Sick of waiting for help, villagers themselves have been searching, Hasnah said.
""We’ve mark the possible bodies with sticks. You can see a foot sticking out, but there's no one here to dig them out."" 
The first signs of recovery are evident in Palu. Electricity has been restored and some shops and banks have reopened and aid and fuel are arriving.
Doctors have been flocking to help from other parts of Indonesia.
The Budi Agung hospital has a capacity of 134 beds with about 20 more set up in a tent outside. They are all full.
Doctors said many patients have been at high risk of infection because they were buried in mud. 
""At this point, the emergency cases have been handled. Most of the surgeries were for broken bones. But the number and nature of injuries was far worse because of the liquefaction and mud,"" said one doctor, Muhammad Riendra.
""All the wounds were dirty.""
Rescue workers are pushing into outlying districts, where residents say they have been scavenging for coconuts, bananas and cassava.
Villagers rushed a Red Cross helicopter that landed in a flood plain in Sigi district, south of Palu, on Friday to drop off blankets and tents, a Reuters witness said.
They scrambled for the supplies unloaded from the back of the aircraft as its rotors spun.
Sulawesi is one of the archipelago nation's five main islands, and like the others, is exposed to frequent earthquakes and tsunami.
