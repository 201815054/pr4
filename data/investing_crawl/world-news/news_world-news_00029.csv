The accident happened three days after 10 Flamengo youth players died and three others were injured when their lodgings caught fire.
Bangu, one of the oldest and most traditional clubs in Rio, were training at a military athletics center when the blaze started after lunch. 
The fire was quickly brought under control but two players were taken to hospital suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation, the military said in a statement.
Bangu could not be reached for comment about the blaze, which TV Globo said may have started in an air conditioning unit.
Friday's fatal fire at the Ninho do Urubu also started when an air conditioning unit caught fire.
Flamengo did not have permits to build the temporary lodgings in the training center that caught fire, although the club denied there was any relation between their ignoring the warnings issued by the city government and the fire itself.
Another five of the dead teenagers were buried on Monday in towns and cities across Brazil.
The boys, all aged between 14 and 16, were at Flamengo training with the youth team and hoping to make it to the professional ranks.
One of the three boys injured in the fire was released from hospital on Monday but two others are still under observation, one of them in serious but stable condition.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido, said on Monday his team had delivered a first cargo of the humanitarian aid that has become a flashpoint in his tussle with President Nicolas Maduro, without specifying how it had received it.
Guaido, who has been recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate president over the past month, tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by stacks of white pots of vitamin and nutritional supplements. He did not say from where or whom they came.
""Today we delivered the first donation, or the first cargo of humanitarian aid, albeit on a small scale, because you know they have blocked the border for the time being,"" Guaido, 35, said in televised remarks in Caracas on Monday evening.
Venezuela's opposition has been coordinating an effort by Western nations, companies and organizations to deliver aid to Venezuela where malnutrition and preventable disease have proliferated in recent years as the economy has nosedived.
Maduro has said this is part of a U.S.-orchestrated strategy to undermine and ultimately overthrow him. He says he will not allow this ""show.""
The United States last month recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader after he declared himself president. Guaido argued Maduro's re-election last year was a sham. The United States has since been joined by a majority of Western nations.
Senior U.S. officials last week heralded their country's efforts to move aid to Venezuela's doorstep, after U.S. supplies were among those delivered to the first collection point established, in the Colombian border town of Cucuta.
There has been no sign of the aid that is being stockpiled in Cucuta leaving the warehouse.
Guaido, who has appealed to the military to allow in the aid, has said it will be collected at points in Brazil and a Caribbean island as well as Cucuta.
Brazil has not yet commented on whether aid is being gathered at any point there.
Leaders of the indigenous Pemon community in the Venezuelan town that contains the only paved border crossing into Brazil have told Reuters they are determined to let aid pass through when and if it arrives.
Meanwhile, Lester Toledo, coordinator of international humanitarian aid for the opposition, told Reuters on Monday he received approval from the Netherlands to speak with the local governments of Aruba and Curacao about setting up an aid center there.

""(Guaido) will announce the day when, from Colombia, from the islands by sea, and from Brazil the humanitarian aid will arrive simultaneously,"" Toledo said.

Emelien, one of Macron's most loyal aides, said on Monday he would leave in late March or early April, while affirming that his departure was unrelated to the so-called Benalla affair.
Alexandre Benalla, the former security advisor, was eventually sacked after footage emerged of him beating demonstrators last May, but the affair left lingering suspicions of an attempted cover-up.
The outcry intensified after it emerged that Benalla had continued to travel on diplomatic passports after he was fired. In a recording taped after his sacking and published last month, Benalla was also heard discussing the support he continued to enjoy from administration figures, including Emelien.
Emelien's exit follows those of Macron's communications advisors Sylvain Fort and Barbara Frugier, and political strategist Stephane Sejourne.
Benalla is under renewed scrutiny over detailed press reports that he brokered security contracts worth 2.2 million euros ($2.5 million) with two Russian oligarchs close to President Putin, before and after he left the Elysee, and may have misled a Senate committee about his role.
French prosecutors said on Friday they had opened a corruption probe of one of the contracts, concluded with Russian tycoon Iskander Makhmudov.
Benalla did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Elysee officials also declined to comment, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginia Democrats pressured Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to resign on Monday over accusations of sexual assault, which he denies, but held off on pursuing impeachment, with the Republican speaker of the state House urging restraint.
Fairfax is one of three top state Democrats engulfed by scandal this month. Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring have also faced criticism after admitting they wore blackface in the 1980s.
Patrick Hope, a Democratic member of Virginia's House of Delegates, said he believed Fairfax should have resigned already after two women accused him of sexual assault but added he would not move immediately on his weekend call for impeachment proceedings.
Adding to the pressure, much of the lieutenant governor's staff have resigned since the second accuser came forward on Friday, according to his spokeswoman, Lauren Burke. They included his policy director and his scheduling director, as well as the executive director and a fundraiser at his political action committee, the Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper reported.
The accusations of racist behavior or sexual assault against the three men have rattled party leadership in a swing state that likely will play a pivotal role in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Democrats have been gaining power in the Southern (NYSE:SO) state in the last few election years.
Party leaders in Virginia and across the nation have called for Northam and Fairfax to resign. They have been more forgiving toward Herring, largely because he came forward on his own to admit having performed in blackface at a 1980 college party, rather than waiting for someone to accuse him.
Northam and Herring are white; Fairfax is black.
Hope, the white Democratic lawmaker who had called for Fairfax's impeachment, renewed his call for the lieutenant governor to resign while saying he was discussing whether impeachment was the best solution.
""Fairfax should have already resigned,"" Hope said in a statement. ""The message being sent to victims of sexual assault is chilling."" He said he believed Fairfax's two accusers.
The scandals may cost the Democrats their chance to take over control of the legislature in November's elections, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. He said the scandals have eroded voters' faith in the party to put forward good candidates, and any perceived racial disparities in consequences may cause further harm.
""You've got three of them in trouble, and then potentially the African-American goes and the two whites stay,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""There could be complete justification for that, but it looks terrible.""
'VOLATILE SITUATION'
House Speaker Kirk Cox, the Republican who would become governor if all three Democrats resigned, said it was too soon to say whether he would support impeachment.
""We need to be very careful with the high standards of impeachment,"" he told reporters. A majority of House members would have to vote to impeach for the proceedings to move to the Senate. A two-thirds majority in the upper chamber would be needed to remove someone from office.
Northam has insisted he would not resign over a 1984 medical school yearbook picture, which showed a person in blackface next to another wearing the robes and hood of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan. Northam denied being in that picture but admitted to dressing in blackface for a social event that same year.
Blackface traces its history to 19th-century minstrel shows that mocked African-Americans, and is seen as offensive by many Americans - though its use continued in U.S. popular culture through to the early 21st century.
About 39 percent of white Americans say it is at least sometimes acceptable to don blackface for a Halloween costume, while 37 percent believed it was never acceptable, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted mostly before Northam's admission and released on Monday. Only 18 percent of black Americans agreed it was at least sometimes acceptable, while 53 percent said it was never acceptable. (https://pewrsr.ch/2tgHl88)
Fairfax has said sexual encounters with both women were consensual.
Members of the legislature's black caucus are also seeking an investigation that does not immediately involve impeachment.

""We don't know how to do that yet,"" Delegate Lamont Bagby, the caucus chairman, said in an interview.

An army source was quoted by state news agency SANA as saying that the ""Israeli enemy"" also hit several sites along border villages close to a 1974 demilitarized zone on the Golan frontier, which with Russian support, the Syrian army regained control from rebels last year. 
Asked about the reported Quneitra strikes, an Israeli military spokeswoman declined comment.
State media earlier said the sites in Quneitra that were hit by Israel came from several tank artillery rounds.
Residents familiar with the area said that the sites targeted fall within the strategic area known as the ""Triangle of Death"" connecting the southern Damascus countryside with Deraa and Quneitra provinces.
The area is a bastion of Iranian-backed militias led by Lebanon's Hezbollah group. The Israeli missile strike coincides with Tehran celebrating the 40th anniversary of the fall of the Shah and the Islamic revolution.
In many cases the deployment of the militias in the area relies heavily on recruitment of local youths, according to two Western intelligence sources.
They say Shi'ite Hezbollah group has consolidated its new front in southern Syria and entrenched Iran's influence since the defeat of Sunni rebels who were once backed by Washington, Jordan and Gulf states.
Israel has mounted attacks in Syria as part of its effort to counter the influence carved out there by Iran, which has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the war that erupted in 2011.
Iranian and Iran-backed groups including Lebanon’s Hezbollah that have deployed in Syria and now maintain a large presence in former rebel-held areas and territory regained from Islamic State militants in eastern Syria, according to regional military experts.
In January, Israeli warplanes carried out a strike on what they called an Iranian arms cache in Syria.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would ramp up its fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.
A senior Israeli official said in September Israel had carried out more than 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years.
With an election looming in April, Israel has been increasingly open about carrying out air strikes.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",Spanish government readies removal of dictator Franco's remains,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist government aims to approve a decree next Friday ordering the removal of dictator Francisco Franco's remains from a grand mausoleum outside Madrid, a senior government official told Reuters on Monday.
More than 40 years after he died, the Franco era remains a sensitive subject in Spain. The plan to move his remains divides Spanish society and political parties, and has been delayed several times over the past months. His family opposes the exhumation. 
Once the removal order has been approved, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government will give Franco's family 15 days to choose a place for the dictator's remains to be reburied, according to eldiario.es website. 
During Franco's 1939-1975 rule, tens of thousands of his opponents were killed and imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent. As many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the preceding civil war.
Transforming the ""Valley of the Fallen"" site, marked by a 152-metre (500-foot) cross on a mountainside and criticized as Europe's only remaining monument to a fascist leader, into a memorial to victims of the brutal civil war, is a longstanding ambition of the Socialist Party. 
Sanchez's promise to remove Franco's remains before the end of his term was one of several high-profile measures intended to appeal to left-wing voters, alongside naming a majority-female cabinet and initially receiving more migrants rescued in the Mediterranean.
The plan to approve the decree comes as speculation grows that Sanchez might call an early election if his government, which controls fewer than a quarter of seats in parliament, fails to persuade lawmakers to back its budget on Wednesday.
Franco's family has said that if his remains are removed, he should be reinterred at the Almudena Roman Catholic Cathedral in central Madrid, where his daughter is buried and where the family owns a burial space. 
But a government report last December concluded that the cathedral was unsuitable as a burial place for security reasons. 

Franco's descendants intend to appeal any decision to move his remains, according to Spanish media.

VATICAN CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - Envoys for Venezuela's self-declared caretaker leader Juan Guaido met Vatican officials and lobbied the Italian government for support on Monday in their quest to keep international pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
The Vatican, which has offered to mediate, called for respect for rights and avoidance of bloodshed after Guaido's bid to end two decades of increasingly authoritarian leftist rule in the volatile OPEC member nation of 30 million people.
Members of the Vatican Secretariat of State met a delegation including Francisco Sucre, president of the foreign affairs commission of Venezuela's National Assembly, and Antonio Ledezma, former mayor of Caracas.
They also met Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini.
""We're in Italy to seek more support for our President @jguaido,"" tweeted Ledezma. ""We're doing well, but we need to finish this with victory.""
The Vatican ""underscored the deep concern that a just and peaceful solution could be found urgently to overcome the crisis while respecting human rights, seeking the good of all the country's people and avoiding bloodshed,"" it said in a statement.
Pope Francis has said the Vatican could mediate if both sides asked. Maduro wants that, but Venezuela's opposition is skeptical given past dialogue failures and Guaido says the starting point for any talks must be Maduro's exit.
Venezuela's opposition regards Maduro as an incompetent dictator who has wrecked their economy and crushed dissent, while he calls them puppets of Washington seeking a coup in order to control the nation's vast oil reserves. 
Rank-and-file opposition supporters, though often Roman Catholics, are suspicious of the Vatican given its support of past talks that have enabled Maduro to win time and survive various waves of protests. 
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin calls the Holy See's stance ""positive neutrality"", saying it has to stay above both sides if it is to help.
The Venezuela conflict has fed into a wider geopolitical struggle. Along with U.S. President Donald Trump, numerous Latin American and European nations have recognized Guaido as interim president and backed his calls for a new, free election.
But other powers, including Russia and China who have billions of dollars invested and loaned to Caracas, have denounced outside interference and backed Maduro.
Breaking the unity of other major European countries, Italy's coalition government is divided over Venezuela. 
Salvini, far-right leader of the Northern League party and also interior minister, favors recognizing Guaido, but its coalition partner the 5-Star Movement believes that is a bad precedent.
Salvini telephoned Guaido while the Venezuelan delegation was visiting him, stressing his opposition to Maduro and support for a new vote, his office said.
Guaido, who heads Venezuela's opposition-led National Assembly, invoked a constitutional provision last month to declare himself president. 

As well as the Vatican, Norway, another traditional international mediator, has also offered to help with dialogue.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: East Libyan force wants to take El Sharara oilfield by talks,"By Ulf Laessing and Ayman Warfalli
MARJ, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan military forces are in talks with protesting state guards to take over the nation's largest oilfield El Sharara peacefully and pass it to the state oil firm, a commander said on Monday.
The comments by Abdel-Razeq Nathouri, chief of staff of the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar, may soothe fears of a battle for the 315,000 barrels-per-day field.
Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with rival administrations and armed groups controlling different territories.
The LNA began an offensive in the south last month to fight Islamist militants, Chadian opposition forces and cross-border smugglers, as well as to secure oil installations.
It reached a remote pumping station, but has not moved on the main El Sharara field which a rival force of state guards seized in December demanding money. Production stopped then.
""We are now in talks with the guards. In the end, Libyans mustn't fight each other,"" Nathouri, who is Haftar's No. 2, told Reuters at his office in the city of Marj in the Green Mountains, a 90-minute drive from main eastern city of Benghazi. 
He did not give details of financial negotiations with the state guards holding El Sharara, though he said their demands on salary payments and uniforms were rightful and would be met.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the negotiations with the group at El Sharara. Tensions there and at the nearby 70,000 bpd El Feel field have risen in past days after the LNA banned flights without its permission. 
PLANE INTERCEPTED
Nathouri said his forces would hand El Sharara over to the Tripoli-based National Oil Company (NOC) once it had control, as it did with oil ports in the center of Libya last year after expelling an armed group holding them.
Players in east Libya have tried to bypass Tripoli, where an internationally-recognized government sits, and export oil direct, but the United Nations has prohibited that, deterring potential buyers. 
To keep oil flowing, Libya's only source of income apart from gas exports, the east has accepted to route oil exports through decade-long established channels via NOC Tripoli. 
On Saturday, the LNA carried out four air strikes near the El Feel oilfield, run by NOC, after a plane landed there, a field engineer said. It intercepted the plane after takeoff the next day to search it.
The Tripoli government, which opposes a rival Benghazi administration backing the LNA, said the planes were evacuating wounded from a previous battle, as well as oil workers.
But Nathouri said in reality the plane had transported a commander from the capital, Ali Kennah, to lead forces in the south. Kennah, however, was no threat as he had been unable to muster a force, he said. 
The LNA had no intentions to move on El Feel as the field was operating without security issues, Nathouri said.
""We don't move on oilfields which are working normally and are under control by NOC. We only move on sites under threat of external forces,"" he said.
Libya used to pump up to 1.6 million bpd under Gaddafi's rule, but that plunged to as low as 90,000 in 2013 due to strife and blockades at fields. Now, with El Sharara paralyzed, NOC produces around 1 million bpd, industry sources say.

NEAR BAGHOUZ, Syria (Reuters) - U.S.-led coalition warplanes struck Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria and hundreds of civilians fled the besieged enclave on Monday as U.S.-backed fighters pressed their campaign to seize it.
Coalition jets roared overhead as columns of white smoke rose from the Islamic State-held Baghouz area a short distance from the Iraqi border, a Reuters witness said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have driven Islamic State (IS) from swathes of northern and eastern Syria with U.S.-led coalition support, launched an offensive on Saturday to capture the enclave in Deir al-Zor province.
The jihadists are putting up stiff resistance and had sought to counter-attack again on Monday morning, according to Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office. Around 1,500 civilians had fled the enclave on Monday, he added.
SDF combatants watched as a column of at least 17 trucks filled with men, women and children left Baghouz along a dusty track into SDF-held territory. Women and children were crammed into the back of one of the trucks.
Some of those fleeing identified themselves as Iraqis.
""It seems there are still many civilians inside Baghouz,"" Bali said. ""We are compelled to go cautiously and accurately in this battle."" 
On the outskirts of Baghouz, the people who had left stood in lines to be questioned by coalition and SDF forces apparently trying to identify whether any were jihadists.
Ahead of launching the attack, the SDF said more than 20,000 civilians had left Baghouz in the preceeding 10 days.
The SDF believes 400 to 600 jihadists may be holed up there, including foreigners and other hardened militants.
Islamic State redrew the map of the Middle East in 2014 when it declared a caliphate across large tracts of Syria and Iraq. But the group steadily lost ground and its two main prizes - the Syrian city of Raqqa and Iraq's Mosul - fell in 2017.
The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, advanced southwards into Deir al-Zor province after capturing Raqqa. Their operations have been focused in areas east of the Euphrates River.
To the west of the Euphrates, in territory otherwise held by the Syrian government and its allies, Islamic State retains a foothold in mountainous terrain.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in December he was pulling all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, saying the battle against Islamic State there was almost won.
The top U.S. commander overseeing American forces in the Middle East said on Sunday that the United States is likely just weeks away from starting the withdrawal.
Islamic State is still widely seen as a threat, however.
A top U.S. general said last week IS would be an enduring menace following the U.S. withdrawal, as it retained leaders, fighters, facilitators and resources that would fuel further insurgency.

Italian freelance photographer Gabriele Micalizzi was wounded on Monday while covering the battles, Italian media reported. The reports said Micalizzi was badly hurt but had not suffered life-threatening injuries and was being flown to Baghdad where he would be evacuated to Italy.

The announcement, made after talks between Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in Ankara and outlined in a joint statement, did not specify what the decisive measures would be or when they might be taken.
The statement was released ahead of a Syrian summit between the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran in Russia on Thursday.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier this year said Moscow had floated the idea of Russia and Turkey mounting a joint operation to push militants out of Idlib, but did not say how Ankara felt about the idea.
Monday's statement, as reported by RIA, spoke of ""the need in particular to take decisive measures to ensure security in the Idlib demilitarized zone."" 
""Despite provocations, we underlined the importance and need to continue partnerships between our two countries' intelligence and military forces to establish peace and to support stability in Idlib,"" it said. 
Russia, one of the Syrian government's staunchest allies, and Turkey brokered a deal in September to create a demilitarized zone in the northwest Idlib region that would be free of all heavy weapons and jihadist fighters. 
The deal helped avert a government assault on the region, the last major bastion of opponents of President Bashar al-Assad. 
However, Moscow has complained about escalating violence in the area and said that militants who used to belong to the Nusra Front group are in control of large swaths of territory. 

Moscow last week called on Turkey to do more to tackle militants there.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria is investigating a possible link between a nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy in England in 2018 and the poisoning of an arms dealer in Sofia in 2015.
Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said on Monday that Sergei Fedotov, a suspect in the attempted killing of ex-spy Sergei Skripal, visited Bulgaria three times in 2015 and was there in April when local arms dealer Emilian Gebrev was poisoned.
Last October, Russian news website Fontanka named Fedotov, who it said worked for the country's GRU military intelligence service, as the third suspect in the Skripal case. 
Tsatsarov said prosecutors had compiled ""significant"" data on Fedotov's trips to Bulgaria and have reopened an investigation into Gebrev's poisoning.
""We are establishing all moments while he was on Bulgarian territory, the hotels, the vehicles he used, contacts with Bulgarian citizens,"" Tsatsarov said.
Former double agent Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, southern England, in March 2018.
Britain said they were poisoned with Novichok, an agent developed by the Soviet Union, and has accused two other men it says are also GRU officers of carrying out the attack. 
Moscow, which never comments on the identity of GRU staff, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning, from which both Skripals recovered.
Last week, the Kremlin questioned the credibility of a report linking the incidents in Britain and Bulgaria.
The investigation into Gebrev's poisoning was reopened in October after he informed prosecutors he had reason to believe the substance used on him might have been similar to Novichok, Tsatsarov said.
Gebrev has not commented on why he might have been poisoned.
A Finnish laboratory test failed to identify the poison but found traces of organophosphates, which are used in fertilisers, in his urine. The lab found no substances from the Chemical Weapons Convention's banned list, Tsatsarov said.
But Tsatsarov said Bulgaria nevertheless issued a European investigation order in December and sent medical data and test results to Britain to check for any Novichok-related links.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had no idea what the accusation against Fedotov was based on. ""Why have we found out about this only now? We do not ... whether (this) corresponds with reality at all,"" he told reporters on Friday.

London's ambassador to Sofia, Emma Hopkins, said Britain was ""looking into the factual underpinnings of these allegations.""

Tiny Lebanon has been host to more than a million refugees from neighboring Syria since the civil war there began in 2011, though some have returned as fighting has eased in more and more areas of the country. 
""In the process of encouraging returns, the Syrian government can make a big contribution, on top of the reconciliations that are already happening, by giving security guarantees,"" Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil told a news conference in Beirut.

Bassil, speaking alongside visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, said he hoped the pace of returns would increase and that Damascus could help smooth this with guarantees on ""individual property rights and military service"". 
Aid agencies that work with refugees have cited concerns over the loss of property and conscription into the Syrian army as big reasons discouraging Syrians from returning, along with fear of reprisals.
Bassil also said guarantees from Damascus would help end what he called an ""ongoing campaign of intimidation"" to stop refugees from going home, without elaborating.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced the package of measures in his annual state of the nation address as part of his right-wing government's efforts to increase the birth rate while holding a hard line against immigration.
The measures include offering a loan worth 10 million forints ($35,400) to any woman below the age of 40 who plans to have children. They will only have to repay two thirds of the loan if they have a second child and the debt will be written off completely if they have three or more children.
Such loans will carry no interest and can be used for any purpose, MITI quoted State Secretary Katalin Novak as saying on Monday. The loan will be offered for a three-year period beginning in July, MTI reported.
The package, which also includes mortgage subsidies, could cost up to 75 billion forints, or 0.17 percent of gross domestic product this year, depending on the number of participants, MTI also cited Novak as saying.
Hungary, like many other European countries, especially in the formerly communist east, is struggling with a sharply declining birth rate but is reluctant to take in more immigrants, fearing they will dilute its distinctive culture and undermine social cohesion.
Orban has refused to take in some of the mostly Muslim migrants who have fled to Europe since 2015 under the European Commission's quota scheme. He also built a border fence to deter migrants seeking to reach western Europe via the Balkans.

""We are urging companies that have agreements with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) to come together to review contracts and above all to reach an agreement that electricity prices will not increase,"" Lopez Obrador said during his morning press conference.
""We are looking to achieve a voluntary restructuring of agreements and commitments within the framework of the law ... The Mexican government is committed to not increasing electricity prices for consumers, but we want private companies to help in this initiative,"" said Lopez Obrador.
Lopez Obrador has been a staunch critic of landmark 2013-14 energy reforms that ended the wholesale electricity monopoly held by CFE and opened up the Mexican oil industry to private investment.

The reforms ended state oil company Pemex's decades-long monopoly by allowing private producers to operate projects on their own as well as enter into partnerships with Pemex known as farm-outs.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Twelve Catalan politicians go on trial on Tuesday for their role in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid, putting the spotlight back on Spain's biggest political crisis in decades which could make it flare once again.
To the dismay of much of the rest of Spain, Catalonia defied a judicial ban by carrying out a referendum and subsequently unilaterally declaring independence in October 2017.
There was shock at home and abroad when police used batons and rubber bullets on protesters on the day of the vote. Some of the Catalan separatist leaders were later arrested or fled the country.
The start on Tuesday of the trial will refocus attention on the region's push for secession which so rattles Spain's political and cultural identity.
The trial will decide if Catalan nationalist leaders stay in jail. The public prosecutor is seeking prison terms of up to 25 years on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds. At stake are Spain's stability, the future of Catalonia's independence movement as well as the region's and the central government's image abroad. 
""It's the most important trial we have had in democracy"", Supreme Court president Carlos Lesmes told reporters on Feb. 1, referring to the return to democracy in Spain after dictator Francisco Franco's death in 1975. 
Raul Romeva, one of nine defendants jailed without bail since late 2017 facing the charge of rebellion, has made clear his view that it should end only with an acquittal. 
""A (prison) sentence would weigh forever on history and on Spain's future,"" Romeva told Reuters in an interview conducted by email from jail.
At the time of his arrest, Romeva was foreign minister in Catalonia's regional government and a member of the European Parliament. 
Fellow defendants include veteran Catalan politicians Oriol Junqueras and Carme Forcadell. Notably absent from the list is former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Belgium and thus cannot be tried in Spain.
The dozen's fate has been a rallying cry for separatists ever since 2017, said Federico Santi, analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia, adding that he expected, like other observers, that the trial will re-ignite tensions. 
Pro-Catalan independence protests had quieted down over the past months but separatist groups have called a series of protests in Catalonia and in Madrid to coincide with the trial. 
Their supporters say they are political prisoners, while Madrid accuses them of breaking the law. 
Among the many witnesses will be Mariano Rajoy, who was Spanish prime minister at the time of the independence vote and its aftermath. 
RIFT 
Lluis Orriols, a political science professor at Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, thinks the trial will reinvigorate the separatist debate ahead of end-May local and regional elections.
""The Catalan question is activating a nationalistic and identitarian confrontation not only in Catalonia but also in all of Spain,"" Orriols said.
The trial starts as the Socialist government, which controls less than a quarter of seats in parliament, faces a key vote on the 2019 budget on Wednesday. A failure to approve the budget proposal could prompt a snap parliamentary election this year. 
Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez relies on smaller parties, and in particular Catalan nationalists, to get the budget adopted. These have said they would block the bill, citing their dissatisfaction with Sanchez's policy towards the region, despite his efforts for dialogue.. 
On the other hand, Spain's right-wing parties accuse Sanchez of being too soft with Catalan separatists. On Sunday, thousands gathered in Madrid to protest Sanchez' Catalan policies. 
In Catalonia, support for the twelve is not unanimous. The population is largely split in two between those who favor remaining part of Spain and those wanting to secede.
After imposing direct rule on Catalonia in October 2017, Madrid called fresh regional elections that December in a bid to curb the independence movement. But the move backfired and the secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan assembly.
The last time a trial for rebellion was held in Spain was in 1982 after a failed military coup attempt. Its leader, found guilty of rebellion by a military court, was sentenced to 30 years of prison.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched and some burned U.S. flags on Monday to mark the 40th anniversary of the triumph of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shi'ite cleric who toppled the Shah in an Islamic Revolution that rattles the West to this day.
On Feb 11, 1979, Iran's army declared its neutrality, paving the way for the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the United States' closest ally in the Middle East. 
State TV showed crowds defying cold rainy weather and carrying Iranian flags while shouting ""Death to Israel, Death to America,"" trademark chants of the revolution which ousted the United States' most important ally in the Middle East.
""Much to the dismay of America, the revolution has reached its 40th year,"" read one banner.
Soldiers, students, clerics and black-clad women holding small children thronged streets across Iran, many carrying portraits of Khomeini, who died in 1989, and Iran's current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The large turnout in state-sponsored rallies came as Iranians face mounting economic hardships many blame on the country's clerical leaders. 
Last year, Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical leadership since a 2009 uprising over disputed elections. 
Prices of basic foodstuffs, particularly meat, have soared since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions.
In January, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran was facing its worst economic crisis since the Shah was toppled. But he remained defiant as Iranians recalled the end of a monarch who catered to the rich and unleashed secret police on dissenters.
In a speech at Tehran's Azadi (Freedom) square, Rouhani said U.S. efforts to isolate Iran would fail. 
""We will not let America become victorious… Iranian people have and will have some economic difficulties but we will overcome the problems by helping each other,"" he said.
U.S. AND ISRAELI ""DOGS""
Marchers carried cardboard cutouts of dogs. One had the face of Trump and the other the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Yadollah Javani, the Revolutionary Guards’ deputy head for political affairs, said Iran would demolish cities in Israel to the ground if the United States attacked the Islamic Republic.
""The United States does not have the courage to shoot a single bullet at us despite all its defensive and military assets,"" he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA. 
State TV showed a cartoon of the Shah being thrown into the ""dustbin of history"", wearing clothes in U.S. colors and holding Iranian newspapers headlined ""The Shah has left!""
Khomeini returned from exile in France two weeks after the Shah and his wife flew to Aswan, Egypt. He was greeted by millions of supporters in Tehran. Revolutionaries later began executing supporters of the Shah including four top generals.
Washington and the Arab world have viewed Iran with
great suspicion since the Islamic Revolution, fearing Khomeini's radical ideology would inspire militants across the Middle East.
Today, the United States and its Arab allies are trying to counter Tehran's growing influence in the Middle East, where it has proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
""The world saw when Iran decided to help people of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Yemen, they achieved victory. The enemies are now confessing to their defeat,"" said Rouhani.
Some Iranians criticize their leaders for what they say are foreign adventures which squander funds. Iranian leaders say they are protecting national interests.
Tehran was determined to expand its military power despite pressure from hostile states, Rouhani said. 
Iran displayed its ballistic missile capabilities during a parade marking the anniversary, including the Zolfaqar, a ground-to-ground missile with a 700 km (435 miles) range and the Qiam, with a range of 800 km, according to Tasnim news agency.

Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Revolutionary Guards deputy head, said Tehran would not withdraw forces from the region, dismissing U.S. calls for Iranian clout to be curbed.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is considering calling a snap election for mid-April, news agency EFE said on Monday, as the government scrambles to find the support it needs to get a pivotal vote on the 2019 budget through parliament.
Sanchez's ruling Socialists hold less than a quarter of the seats in the lower house, and speculation about whether it will serve a full term has swirled since it took office last summer when the conservative People's Party lost a confidence vote.
He is considering calling an early election for April 14, EFE - the state news agency - cited unnamed government sources as saying.
Online newspaper El Confidencial cited sources close to Sanchez as ""totally"" ruling out that date, but the chances of his administration serving its full term, scheduled to run until 2020, appear slim.
Officials told Reuters in recent days that an early election was likely, though no date had yet been set. 
Socialist party Deputy Secretary General Adriana Lastra said on Monday this was a certainty if the budget vote did not pass.
The government said it was focusing on getting the budget adopted and did not comment on possible early election dates.
Sanchez's party has been struggling to gather enough support to pass the fiscal bill, and depends on the vote of smaller parties, including Catalan nationalists, who have said they will vote against it.
Catalan separatist parties have until Wednesday to say if they maintain their objection to the budget. One government official said that speculation over early election could be a way to put pressure on them to change their mind.
Polls have shown that the conservatives, centre-right and far-right, all of whom have taken a harder line on Catalonia than Sanchez, could win enough votes in a national election to govern together.
But cooperation with the Socialists is unlikely to be uppermost in the separatists' minds this week.
On Tuesday, 12 Catalan politicians will appear in Spain's highest court on charges of mounting a rebellion for their role in the region's independence bid in 2017, which was quashed by Madrid. 
Sources told Reuters over the past days that May 26 was another possible election date, to coincide with EU, regional and local polls.

That option was favored by advisors to Sanchez, while senior Socialist party officials prefer an April election, the sources said. Earlier on, sources had also pointed at October as a possible date.

Kramp-Karrenbauer took over from Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in December, campaigning on a centrist platform that put her closer to the Social Democrats than to the right-wing rivals she defeated.
Opening the immigration policy meeting on Sunday, Kramp-Karrenbauer said she was pleased to be joined by members of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) - only she confused her own party with the Social Democrats.
""I am particularly pleased that we are not only doing this here as Social Democrats tonight, but that we are doing this together with friends from the CSU,"" she said to embarrassed laughter from CDU members, including cabinet ministers.
She immediately corrected herself and tried to explain her slip as ""something to do with the Social Democrats dealing with a big trauma in their party"" over reform of the Hartz IV labor market reforms they introduced from 2005.
German media jumped on the slip-up - the tabloid Bild called it an ""embarrassing mishap"" - and the SPD poked fun at Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed AKK after her initials, by advising her on the Social Democrats' standard greeting to each other.
""Dear @akk,"" tweeted SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil. ""Small tip for the future: It is 'Dear comrades!' Greetings in solidarity.""
The conservative alliance of CDU and CSU only teamed up with the SPD to renew their ""grand coalition"" last year after their talks with two smaller parties on forming an alliance collapsed.
Kramp-Karrenbauer's election as CDU leader put her in pole position to become Germany's next chancellor and she is trying to put her own stamp on the party. Merkel has said she will not seek re-election after this parliamentary term, ending in 2021.
The CDU meets again on Monday to discuss how to avoid a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis that saw more than 1 million asylum seekers flood into Germany after Merkel decided to leave open the country's borders. They are meeting without Merkel.

CLONES, Ireland (Reuters) - Weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union, the owner of a filling station and hardware store that straddles the only land border between the two jurisdictions has given up trying to prepare. 
Eamon Fitzpatrick, whose service station is partly in Ireland and partly in the British province of Northern Ireland, fears he may have to change his business and push up prices after Brexit - which could also trigger a revival of smuggling. 
But he says he can hardly prepare because he has no idea which scenario will play out on March 29: a chaotic exit, a delay, or a smooth transition period. 
""It's like asking somebody: 'There's a 10-horse race - which horse is gonna win?'"" 
Policy U-turns have gone from monthly to daily, he said. 
""Up until these last six or eight months, I took a greater interest in it to see what was going on or trying to follow it. Now I’ve kind-of given up.""
A survey published on Monday by Allied Irish Banks suggested he was not alone, finding that over 50 percent of small and medium businesses in Ireland and Northern Ireland had not even started preparing for Brexit.
Fitzpatrick's station, which employs 20 people, has been running for two decades, and has more than once taken advantage of currency and tax fluctuations to offer cheaper fuel to people on one side of the border or the other; Ireland uses euros, Britain - pounds.
EUROS OR POUNDS, SIR?
Ireland's accession to the European bloc in 1973 removed the need for customs checks on the border.
And a 1998 peace pact was based in part on removing the security checks designed to prevent both the militant incursions and cross-border smuggling that had bedevilled Northern Ireland during more than two decades of fighting between Irish nationalist and British ""unionist"" militias.
Since then, the 500-km (300-mile) border has been all but invisible - a boon for trade, friendships, and those using the roads that snake back and forth across the winding frontier.
People in the border area often go around with sterling in one pocket and euro in the other. Some people cross the border a dozen times a day.
Now, it is the effort to prevent the return of a ""hard border"" that has proved the biggest sticking point in Britain's attempts to negotiate a smooth, phased exit from the EU on March 29. If it fails, and Britain crashes out, Ireland will have little choice but to restore customs checks in short order.
In the worst-case scenario of a hard Brexit, Fitzpatrick fears he may have to physically separate the fuel pumps and hardware stores on either side of the border. He jokes that he may have to build a ""Trump-style"" border wall.
Not that there has been any official support to prepare for Brexit for the firm or its neighbors, Fitzpatrick said. ""There's nobody getting help, whatsoever.""
And he is still not convinced that, even on March 29, the shape of the border will be clear: 

""A week's a long time, as you talk about in politics. The week either side of March 29 could be a hell of a long time.""

ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria had more than 70 candidates for president when campaigning began for Saturday's elections. 
But only those from the two main parties - President Muhammadu Buhari and former vice president Atiku Abubakar - have a real shot at leading Africa's most populous nation.
While a handful of the other candidates are touted as civil society alternatives, their chances of winning are slim without the big parties' wealth and patronage.
THE GENERAL: MUHAMMADU BUHARI 
Muhammadu Buhari, 76, made history in 2015 as the first person to democratically oust an incumbent president in Nigeria. Now, as candidate for the All Progressives Congress (APC), he is seeking a second term. It is his fifth run at the presidency.
A reputation as a staunch opponent of corruption was key to Buhari's victory at the last election. 
A Muslim, born on Dec. 17, 1942 in the northwestern town of Daura in Katsina state, Buhari spent his career in the army. Installed as military dictator after a coup in December 1983, his approach was typified by policies that included having people whipped if they refused to queue at bus stops.
He was overthrown less than two years later in another coup, after the military figures who installed him became displeased with his methods.
But Buhari's anti-corruption cachet has remained strong among his supporters and helped him run successfully in 2015 against Goodluck Jonathan of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The party had been in power since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999. 
Buhari rode a wave of anti-corruption sentiment, coupled with promises to revive the stuttering economy and defeat the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency. 
Despite a lack of corruption convictions, Nigeria's first recession in 25 years and a resurgence of Islamist attacks, those policies are little changed for the 2019 race.
He earned the nickname 'Baba Go Slow' during his first term when critics said he governed at a glacial pace, particularly when low oil prices caused a currency crisis. The moniker first entered popular usage to describe Buhari when he took six months to appoint a cabinet. 
Some, including his wife, have said access to Buhari is tightly controlled by close advisers, known in Nigeria as ""the cabal"", and that they are really directing policy. 
https://reut.rs/2WAHLna
Buhari was absent for five months in 2017, being treated in Britain for an unspecified ailment. Despite that illness, he announced in early 2018 that he would seek re-election, raising concerns about whether he could serve another four years. Buhari has said he has the energy to do so.
To his admirers, Buhari is frugal, moral and prizes loyalty above other qualities in his allies - a foil to the alleged excesses of the PDP. To his critics, he is an ailing relic with little head for policy and no concern for the rule of law.
THE TYCOON: ATIKU ABUBAKAR
Atiku Abubakar is the 72-year-old candidate for the PDP, the party that inherited power from the military in 1999 and governed for the next 16 years. For the first eight of those years, Atiku was vice president to Nigeria's new democratic leader and former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo.
Atiku, like Buhari, is also a northern Muslim, born in Adamawa state. During the later years of military rule, he became a senior customs official, and later a businessman with ventures in port oil and gas logistics as well as a private university. 
He sought the APC presidential ticket for the 2015 elections but lost to Buhari and threw his support behind him, funding his campaign and even lending him a private jet.
Atiku switched sides again in 2017, and last year emerged as the PDP's candidate. He has promised to ""make Nigeria work again"", lifting it out of the economic doldrums with business-friendly policies that he says will create jobs.
He has for years been dogged by corruption accusations, which he denies. Critics say Atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most Nigerians. 
His supporters hoped to have put an end to some of those allegations when Atiku traveled to the United States last month, after years of rumors that he could not because of investigations revealing his ties to corruption there.
But Atiku had been barred from entering the United States, and Washington only granted him a temporary reprieve from the ban, Reuters reported last week. 
To his supporters, Atiku is an accomplished businessman with the economic credentials needed to boost growth, create jobs and attract foreign investors back to Nigeria as it struggles to recover from the first recession in a generation. His opponents say he is a kleptocrat who lacks a moral compass and consistent ideology.

The League, headed by Matteo Salvini, still runs with its traditional allies Forza Italia and Brothers of Italy in local elections, but governs at a national level with 5-Star.
The center-right candidate, Marco Marsilio, won 48 percent of the vote in the mountainous Abruzzo region, the official count showed, while a center-left coalition was ousted from power, gaining 31 percent of the vote.
5-Star trailed in third, taking 20 percent -- far below the 40 percent it won in the region in last year's national parliamentary ballot. 
The League, buoyed in recent months by its uncompromising stance on immigration, scored almost 28 percent of the vote on Sunday against some 13.9 percent it took in Abruzzo in the March 2018 national election.
The anti-establishment 5-Star, which always runs alone at elections, has never managed to win power in a region, but has traditionally seen its vote count rise in national ballots.
The League and 5-Star alliance in Rome has appeared increasingly fractured in recent weeks, with disagreements bubbling up over a series of issues, including on the construction of an Alpine tunnel and even on who to support in the Venezuelan political crisis.
""It's a vote in Abruzzo and I don't think our 5-Star friends have anything to fear,"" Salvini told reporters, playing down speculation political instability could rise on the back of the vote as 5-Star seeks to regain the initiative.
""As far as I'm concerned, nothing changes,"" added the League leader, who has become the predominant force in Italian politics since last March, thanks to a savvy use of social media and a folksy, plain-spoken approach that has appealed to many voters.
5-Star Transport Minister, Danilo Toninelli, said there was ""a bit of disappointment"" over the result, while 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has yet to comment. 

Both parties see the upcoming European Parliament election in May as an important test that could affect the balance of power not only in Brussels, but also within the government.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Monday postponed the corruption trial of former prime minister Najib Razak over charges related to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB pending an appeal, his lawyer said. 
Najib was ousted in an election in May last year amid public fury over the alleged theft of $4.5 billion from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
He has pleaded not guilty to ten charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power and his trial was originally set to begin on Tuesday. 
His lawyers, however, filed an application last week to stay the trial pending an appeal over a lower court's ruling to transfer some of the charges to Kuala Lumpur High Court, media reported. 
Harvinderjit Singh, one of Najib's lawyers, told Reuters in a brief text message that the Court of Appeal had agreed to postpone the trial ""until the appeal is heard"". 
No new date for the trial or the appeal has been set, he said. 
The postponement is seen as a blow for the government of Mahathir Mohamad, which reopened probes into 1MDB shortly after the election and had promised to bring those involved in the scandal swiftly to justice. 
Prosecutor V. Sithambaram told Reuters he expected the appeal to take only a week or two. 
""It's just a hiccup,"" he said. ""The case is just delayed slightly."" 
The charges against Najib relate to a suspected transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.3 million) into Najib's bank account from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.
CHARM OFFENSIVE
The trial is the first of four criminal proceedings that Najib is expected to face over the 1MDB scandal so far, and the sum involved is a fraction of the $1 billion that investigators say allegedly made their way into his bank accounts. 
Police found nearly $300 million worth of goods and cash at properties linked to Najib soon after the election.
Authorities have also charged his wife, Rosmah Mansor, and several high-ranked officials of the former administration. All of them have pleaded not guilty. 
Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing and says the charges against him are politically motivated.
In recent weeks, he has undergone a public makeover, appearing in a music video portraying himself as a champion of the working class and throwing jibes at the ruling government on social media in a bid to shed the image of a wealthy, elite politician. 
But the charm offensive may not help him in court. Najib faces years in prison after being hit with a total of 42 criminal charges, most of them linked to 1MDB. 
At least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore, have launched money laundering and graft probes into 1MDB, set up by Najib in 2009.

U.S. prosecutors say money stolen from 1MDB was used to buy a private jet, luxury real estate, artwork by Picasso and Monet, as well as jewelry for Rosmah.

Entitled ""The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?"", their report aims to set the agenda for leaders at the Munich Security Conference annual meeting from Thursday.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is due to attend the event in the Bavarian capital, which comes after Washington said earlier this month it would suspend compliance with a landmark nuclear missile pact with Russia.
""Given the prevailing strategic outlooks in Washington, Beijing, and Moscow, expectations of a new era of great power competition are seeming to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" the report read. 
""If everyone prepares for a hostile world, its arrival is almost preordained ... The post-Cold War period – and the general optimism associated with it – has come to an end. 
""But it is unclear what kind of new order will emerge ... and whether the transition period will be peaceful.""
Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington, urged policymakers from mid-sized powers including the European Union to do more to preserve a liberal international order.
In a newspaper interview, Ischinger suggested France's nuclear arsenal should serve the purpose of shielding the whole of the EU and not just France. This would mean EU countries would have to share the cost of maintaining France's nuclear weapons, he told the Funke group of newspapers.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addresses the conference on Saturday, is using her last term to focus on a foreign policy aimed at defending and refreshing multilateralism.
But the report said Berlin and Paris needed to work together more effectively to boost the capacity of the ""ill-prepared"" EU to deal with heightened great power competition.
""With domestic contexts in both capitals unlikely to become less complicated, the coming year will show whether the tandem can work out its differences or whether another window of opportunity has been missed,"" the report read.
Running through other mid-sized powers, the report turned to Britain and said ""Brexit proceedings will continue to inflict wounds on both sides of the Channel for years to come.""

Looking further east, it said: ""Those counting on Japan to anchor security in East Asia may yet have to temper their expectations.""

PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - A year after the deadliest high-school shooting in U.S. history, students from Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School look back with pride on the network they have built to stem the country's epidemic of gun violence through the ballot box.
Even so, it has been difficult for many to come to terms with the trauma of Feb. 14, 2018, when a former Stoneman student with an assault gun massacred 17 people at the Parkland, Florida campus.
""There's definitely not a day that goes by where I'm not thinking about it, and I know for a fact that everyone that has to walk through those campus gates is thinking about it,"" said junior Caitlynn Tibbetts.
The student campaign in support of gun control, which featured a massive march on Washington and in other cities around the country, resulted in the formation of a sprawling national network called March for Our Lives.
With some 500 chapters, it has linked tens of thousands of student activists in pushing for political candidates who support their goals of new measures to reduce gun violence.
“We have to replace these terrible actors who are comfortable putting our lives at risk for a check from the NRA,” said Matt Deitsch, the group's chief strategist, referring to the National Rifle Association, which opposes what it considers any retreat on gun rights.
Deitsch, along with Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr and Jaclyn Corin, is among the most prominent Stoneman students who have toured the nation to encourage young people to register and vote for pro-gun control candidates.
By ""terrible actors,"" Deitsch was referring to political incumbents who oppose the group's goals, which include a ban on assault weapons. It also backs funding for gun violence research and supports universal background checks, disarming domestic abusers and enacting laws to staunch gun trafficking. 
""The fact that gun violence is a top issue for the first time ever is something that should scare the people arrayed against us,"" Deitsch, 21, said with evident pride.
Having put together a multimillion-dollar war chest, with the help of A-list celebrities like George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, the network aims to expand to thousands of high schools and colleges by the end of 2019, giving it even more clout going into the 2020 election. 
On Monday, activists were to launch a petition campaign to put an assault weapons ban on Florida's ballot in the 2020 election. March For Our Lives leader Hogg, among the first Stoneman students to call for greater gun control in the hours after the shooting, was expected to attend the campaign kickoff, along with parents of some of the victims. The petition needs 800,000 signatures. 
""I'M A HUMAN BEING""
Success has come at a cost for the student activists. Since last year's shooting, many have not had enough time to grieve or properly process the tragedy. 
In a series of recent Twitter messages, Tarr, a March for Our Lives co-founder, reflected on having to put on a composed ""performance"" over the past year as a public figure on social media. 
""I can't sit back and let you think that I'm always fine, that I'm always ready to go. That's not realistic,"" she wrote. ""I'm a human being and god damn if all of this work and pain isn't hard.""
The past year has brought more U.S. gun violence, complicating the task of recovery. In a shooting with echoes of Parkland, a gunman at Santa Fe High School in Texas killed 10 and wounded 14 on May 18. Months later, an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead and six injured. 
By the end the year, that pair of shootings, combined with hundreds of others, left a total of 387 dead, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
""We carry a heavy weight, and every single day there’s another mass shooting in America, and we see ourselves as vessels amplifying what’s going on this country,"" Deitsch said.
For many students, sharing their experiences, both broadly and with those who have gone through something similar, has been therapeutic, however.
Not long after the shooting, a publisher contacted Sarah Lerner, a journalism and English teacher at Stoneman, about publishing a book filled with reflections of that day and its aftermath. 
""Parkland Speaks: Survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas Share Their Stories"" was released late last month and includes 43 accounts of the shooting and what followed, including two pieces by Tibbetts, the junior.

“This book gave us the opportunity to look past politics and look at the heart of it,"" Tibbetts said. ""And the heart of it is that we’re struggling to move past it, but we’re trying.”

The health of Chiwenga, 62, is closely followed in Zimbabwe because he is widely seen as the power behind President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the front-runner to succeed him. He led the coup that ousted long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017. 
A gaunt-looking Chiwenga was last seen in public last Tuesday, when he told state television he was not dying but gave no details about his condition. Since last year, Chiwenga's hands have been visibly swollen with discolored skin patches.
Information deputy minister Energy Mutodi said on Twitter Chiwenga ""is recovering well from some minor abdominal ailment in Delhi, India."" He declined to make further comment.
His tweet was ridiculed by citizens in a country where government officials routinely seek medical help abroad while the public health system has collapsed and hospitals struggle to provide medicines to patients.
ZimLive.com, an online news agency, reported last Thursday that Chiwenga had been flown to India for treatment but did not say what he was suffering from.
Days earlier, a private daily newspaper had reported that Chiwenga had traveled to Cape Town, South Africa, for treatment, his second visit in four months. 
Mnangagwa has dismissed rumors of a rift with Chiwenga. These gathered momentum after Mnangagawa promised action in response to a brutal security crackdown carried out against protesters last month while the president was abroad. Chiwenga was acting president at that time.

U.S.-allied Arab states including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates backed the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad for years but Damascus was able to steadily crush rebel fighters with military backing from Russia and Iran.
In a big diplomatic boost for Assad, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus in December, saying it aimed to normalize ties and curb risks of regional interference in “Arab, Syrian affairs” - an apparent reference to non-Arab Iran and Turkey.
But Arab League Secretary General and former Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, speaking during a visit to Beirut, said there was no consensus yet on Syria being allowed back into the League.
""I follow this subject very closely and I do not yet observe conclusions that lead to the consensus that we are talking about and that may lead to an (Arab) foreign ministers meeting in which they announce the end of the difference and therefore call for Syria to return to occupy the seat,"" he said.
The Arab League is due to hold a summit meeting at the end of March in Tunisia.
Asked about the prospects for Syria's readmission, Aboul Gheit noted that Arab League foreign ministers were due to hold two meetings before the summit.
""But the matter is not time, the matter is will. The matter is consensus among the states,"" he said.

""For Syria to return, there must be consensus.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Monday freed a jailed refugee Bahraini footballer with residency status in Australia, after Bahrain abandoned its bid to seek his extradition, and immigration officials said he was immediately driven to the airport.
Hakeem Al Araibi, 25, who fled Bahrain in 2014 and received refugee status in Australia, was arrested in November last year at a Bangkok airport while on a honeymoon trip, following an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain's request.
However, the Middle East nation has withdrawn the request, prompting a Thai court to approve a motion by prosecutors to drop the case against the footballer, Thai officials said.
""There are no grounds to hold him anymore. It is his right to decide where he will go next. He is a free man,"" said Chatchom Akapin, an official in the Thai Attorney-General's office.
A Reuters witness said Araibi was seen leaving the Bangkok remand prison in a car and immigration officials said he was heading for the main international airport in the Thai capital.
Rights group Amnesty International, which lobbied for his release, later said Araibi had arrived at the airport.
It was not immediately clear when or why Bahrain withdrew its request. A Bahrain government spokesman declined to give details when asked who ordered the halt of the legal proceedings. 
However, authorities in Bahrain, which has accused Araibi of crimes committed during the Arab Spring protests of 2011, said the country reaffirmed its right to pursue legal action against him.
In a statement, Bahrain's foreign ministry said it had noted the halt of legal proceedings and the verdict against the footballer remained in place.
Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had no comment on the case. 
The detention of Araibi, who appeared with his feet in shackles at a court hearing last week, drew international criticism, with Australian authorities and fellow footballers urging Thailand to release him. He says he faces torture if returned to Bahrain.
In the Australian capital of Canberra, Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the decision of the Thai government.
""We greatly respect the process that they have had to work through and we greatly appreciate their listening to the issues that have been raised by our government and many others,"" he told a news conference.
On social network Twitter, former Australia soccer captain Craig Foster, who had helped lobby officials at world governing body FIFA, said, ""My thanks go to the wonderful people of Thailand for your support and to the Thai government for upholding international law.""
Araibi has said he wants to return to Australia, where he has lived since 2014 and plays for a Melbourne football club.
He was convicted of vandalizing a police station during 2011 anti-government protests in Bahrain and sentenced in absentia after he fled. Araibi denies the charges, saying he was playing in a televised soccer match at the time of the police station attack. 
New York-based Human Rights Watch has said Araibi was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the 2011 protests. 

Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.

BEIJING/ANKARA (Reuters) - Chinese state media has released a video it said proves Uighur poet and musician Abdurehim Heyit is alive, after Turkey cited reports of his death in custody in a strongly worded condemnation of ""human rights violations"" in Xinjiang. 
In the 26-second video posted online by China Radio International's Turkish language service late on Sunday, a man dressed in a grey sweater identifies himself as Heyit before declaring himself to be in ""good health"".
""Today is February 10, 2019,"" he said. ""I'm in the process of being investigated for allegedly violating the national laws. I'm now in good health and have never been abused.""
Reuters was unable to independently confirm the authenticity of the video. 
On Saturday, in a rare move from a majority-Muslim power, the Turkish Foreign Ministry called on China to close its internment camps for Muslims, saying the camps said to hold a million ethnic Uighurs are a ""great shame for humanity"".
That statement had come in response to a question about recent reports that Heyit had died while in Chinese detention, having been ""sentenced to eight years in prison for one of his songs"". 
""This tragedy has further reinforced the reaction of the Turkish public opinion toward serious human rights violations committed in the Xinjiang region,"" ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said on Sunday.
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the video showed Heyit was not only alive, but in very good health, and that Turkey's statements were ""extremely mistaken and irresponsible"". 
She said Heyit was being held pending investigation for ""crimes endangering national security"", but referred further questions to Xinjiang authorities, which did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
A Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters that while it was naturally a positive development if the video was ""true"" and Heyit was alive, the main issue the Turkish foreign ministry addressed in its statement was the ""heavy violations"" of human rights in China. 
The source said that prior to the video, they had not received any information on Heyit or the ""many"" others in similar conditions. 
""We expect information on these issues,"" the source said. ""We hope Chinese authorities will be more open on such issues from now on."" 
Uighur diaspora activists said Heyit's body language and unnatural speech patterns in the video suggested his testimony may have been coerced and that even digital alteration could not be ruled out. 
International rights groups say China routinely coerces detainees into making videotaped confessions which are then broadcast through state media to serve the government's propaganda objectives.
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home.(https://tinyurl.com/y9zzouss) 

China denied the existence of the so-called ""re-education"" facilities for months before saying they were in fact vocational training centers designed to combat religious extremism, and has increasingly been on the front foot in defending its actions.

NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - On a backstreet in Iraq's holy city of Najaf, Iranian pilgrims shuffle in and out of a small doorway, making a short but important detour. They have come to see where the leader of the Islamic revolution once dwelled in exile.
The former home of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who in 1979 led an uprising that ousted the Shah of Iran, is bustling with tourists on the 40th anniversary of the birth of the Islamic Republic.
Escaping for a moment Najaf's crowded Shi'ite Muslim shrine nearby, they tour the humble home which is now a museum and gallery showcasing Khomeini's political and personal life.
Teenagers take selfies in rooms where he studied, prayed and developed his ideas for the establishment of an Islamic state.
""The house captures the spirit of Khomeini. He was not interested in money or worldly possessions - he was there to serve the people,"" said one visitor, 56-year-old Mohammad Javad Elahi.
Khomeini's Najaf abode, where he lived for 13 years before being expelled from Iraq by Saddam Hussein in 1978, has little furniture. His private meeting room is small with only a carpet to sit on.
Photos on the walls show Khomeini with his children and grandchildren, although most are iconic pictures of the uprising, including the takeover of Iran's embassy in Paris by protesters and Khomeini's arrival by plane in Tehran after the fall of the Shah.
Elahi, a logistics manager from Tehran, said he saw Khomeini's legacy as an Iran that stands firm in the face of U.S. sanctions. Despite unrest over a hurt economy, sanctions had served to unite many Iranians behind their current government, he said.
""We don't suffer the upheaval of some of our neighbors. Things are mostly stable,"" he said, referring to conflicts in Arab countries in recent years.
Other visitors said they saw the Islamic republic as an improvement on the secular monarchy which it replaced.
""I was 13 during the revolution. I remember the time of the Shah. He was a Western puppet – the economy and politics of Iran was basically in the hands of America and its allies,"" said Alireza Ghorbani, a retired school teacher.
""The Shah's secret service killed and tortured opposition, including clerics.""
'BETTER THAN THE SHAH'
The 1979 uprising deposed Western-allied Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Khomeini spent the final year of his exile in France.
Khomeini's Islamic republic, and the leadership that has followed it under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been criticized internationally for crackdowns on political opponents, including during protests over alleged election fraud in 2009 and last year over wages and complaints of corruption.
Those visiting Khomeini's Najaf home, all religious tourists, said they support Iran's clerical establishment.
""Most people in Iran supported the revolution,"" said Mohammad Kazemi, a clergyman from northwestern Tabriz. ""Things are still better than before. Today I'm here to pay my respects to its leader.""
Khomeini went into exile in the 1960s, first to Turkey then to Najaf. The Iraqi city and Qom in Iran are the seats of the two great seminaries for Shi'ite clergy. Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is based in Najaf. 
Khomeini mostly kept a low profile in Najaf, studying and lecturing, but also developed his ideas for a system of Islamic governance.
Iran's influence in Iraq, which has steadily grown since the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, has brought with it increasing numbers of Iranian tourists and pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands visit Iraq's holy shrines at Najaf and Kerbala each year.

This week, many were stopping through Khomeini's home.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Thai election panel disqualifies princess as PM candidate,"By Panarat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's election panel on Monday disqualified the sister of the king from running for prime minister, putting an end to a stunning, short-lived candidacy by echoing King Maha Vajiralongkorn's words that royalty should be ""above politics"".
The Election Commission released the official list of parties' candidates for prime minister without the name of Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, 67, the king's elder sister.
The list excluded Ubolratana ""because every member of the royal family comes within the application of the same rule requiring the monarch to be above politics and to be politically neutral,"" the panel said in a statement after a meeting.
The princess had accepted the nomination of the Thai Raksa Chart party, a populist movement drawn from supporters of ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been at the center of more than a decade of turmoil in Thai politics.
The March 24 elections are the first since a 2014 military coup toppled a pro-Thaksin government. Among the candidates for prime minister is the current junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, who as army chief led the coup.
The panel did not mention a separate petition seeking to ban Thai Raksa Chart on the grounds that it violated election laws against using the monarchy in campaigning.
Party leaders were not immediately available for comment and canceled a press conference planned for Monday.
Ubolratana's surprise nomination broke with a tradition that members of the royal family stay out of politics. 
Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the royal family wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, with the king considered to be semi-divine.
In a statement read on all Thai television stations within hours of Ubolratana's announcement as a candidate, King Vajiralongkorn said it was ""inappropriate"" and unconstitutional for members of the royal family to enter politics. 
ON EDGE
The dramatic events since Friday have put Thais on edge. Riot police units were on high alert in Pichit province, north of Bangkok, where the princess was due to visit later this week, according to Matichon newspaper.
Bangkok has been locked in political conflict for more than a decade - with street protests sometimes paralyzing the capital for months at a time - between supporters of Thaksin's populist brand of politics and the mostly-middle class and urban establishment who identify with the monarchy and the military.
Parties loyal to Thaksin, a former telecommunications tycoon, have defeated pro-establishment parties to win every election since 2001. Each of their governments has been removed by court rulings or coups since 2006.
The hashtag '#coup' was trending on Thai-language Twitter on Monday and a fake document also circulated online claiming that the junta had sacked commanders in the army, navy and air force.
The rumors were false and intended to destabilize Thailand, the spokesman for the ruling junta, Colonel Winthai Suvaree, told reporters. 
""This is organized behavior with hope to gain something, particularly to disturb the peace of the country during this important moment,"" he said.
The pro-Thaksin camp's bid to nominate a member of the royal family electrified the election race, but it could backfire on Thai Raksa Chart, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political science professor at Ubon Ratchathani University.

Dissolving Thai Raksa Chart could hand more seats to military-affiliated parties or other established parties, as well as a separate youth-oriented populist party.

Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and was voted into office in 2015, is hoping to win a new term in a presidential election scheduled to take place on Saturday.
The chief justice could preside over any dispute over the election result. Nigeria's judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging.
""International human rights standards provide that judges may be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence,"" said Diego Garcia-Sayan, the U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.
""Any decision to suspend or remove a judge from office should be fair and should be taken by an independent authority such as a judicial council or a court,"" he said in a statement.
Garcia-Sayan, who is mandated by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate legal and judicial independence, said dismissing judges without following legal procedures or offering a chance to contest the decision was incompatible with the independence of the judiciary.
Buhari suspended Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen on Jan. 25 following an order by a tribunal on public officials' conduct and replaced him with Ibrahim Tanko Mohammad.
But four courts superior to the tribunal had already ordered a stay of proceedings and the tribunal had previously said it lacked jurisdiction over cases involving judicial officers, Garcia-Sayan said. 
The U.N. statement said some of the judges and the defense lawyers involved in Onnoghen's case had been subject to serious threats, pressures and interference.

Naypyitaw is not a common destination for foreign tourists, but some curious visitors are drawn to its oversized official buildings and largely empty, runway-like roads. The junta constructed the city in secret and moved the country's administration there in the mid-2000s. 
In 2017, two foreign journalists for Turkish state TV station TRT World and their interpreter spent two months in a Myanmar jail for flying a drone over the legislature. The three pleaded guilty to breaching the colonial-era Aircraft Act.
Thein Min Htwe, a policewoman in Naypyitaw's Ottara Thiri township, confirmed reports a Frenchman was detained for flying an unmanned aerial vehicle, but declined to say what charges he was arrested on.
Local media said police detained the man on a bridge at the entrance to Naypyitaw's sprawling parliament complex on Thursday and that he was accused of illegally importing the drone.
Online outlet News Watch published a photo a man holding a small Chinese-made drone and an image of a passport belonging to 27-year-old French citizen, Arthur Desclaux. 
Kyaw Naing, an official at the French embassy in Yangon, confirmed that consular officials were aware of the arrest, but declined to provide details.
Asked what charges the Frenchman was facing, he said: ""We don't know yet. We are contacting the Myanmar authorities.""
The legal status of drones in Myanmar is unclear. Myint Htwe, a director at the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, said drones were not mentioned in the ""dos and don'ts"" displayed at points of entry, but that importers may need permission from other government departments.
""There are regional orders (on where drones can be flown),"" he said. ""There are some areas where you can use drones.""

39,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Meth 'disaster' for region as seizures surge in Thailand,"By Tom Allard
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Seizures of high-purity crystal methamphetamine have surged more than tenfold in Thailand over the past two years, statistics show, a stark indicator of the growth in industrial-scale production of the stimulant in neighboring Myanmar.
Thailand is a major trafficking route for crystal meth manufactured in Myanmar's Shan and Kachin states, where police say Asian organized crime groups have allied with local pro-government militias and armed rebels to set-up ""super labs"".
The drug syndicates have distributed the meth across the Asia-Pacific region, from South Korea to New Zealand and most countries in between, authorities say.
Some 18.4 tonnes of crystal meth, also known as ice, was seized in Thailand in 2018, according to preliminary statistics from the country's Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) reviewed by Reuters. The final data is expected to be released publicly next month. That is up from 5.2 tonnes in 2017 and 1.6 tonnes in 2016. It's more than treble the amount captured across all of Southeast Asia five years ago.
Myanmar's illicit labs also pump out tablets of meth mixed with caffeine, commonly know as ""yaba"", or crazy pill, in the Thai language. The tablets are popular with low-paid workers in gruelling jobs and poor recreational drug users across Southeast Asia.
Thai authorities seized 516 million meth tablets in 2018, more than double the previous year and four-and-a-half times the 114 million pills captured in 2016.
Niyom Termsrisuk, secretary general of the ONCB, told Reuters that, despite the rising seizures, prices for meth are falling, suggesting far more is eluding authorities than being stopped.
The average price of a meth tablet was 200 baht ($6.33) in 2013. The latest data, for 2017, showed a yaba pill can be bought for as little as 80 baht ($2.50), he said.
By flooding Thailand and other countries with meth, organized crime groups have ""generated new users"" by enticing them with lower prices, Niyom said. The users then become dependent on the highly addictive drug, creating a bigger market for the product.

""2018 A DISASTER""
Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle - which encompasses northern Myanmar and parts of Laos and Thailand - has long been a hub of illicit drug trafficking. 
While opium cultivation and heroin refining has fallen in the past decade, methamphetamine production has more than filled the breach.
""It's hard to say anything other than 2018 was a disaster for the meth supply coming out of Myanmar,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the Asia representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Law enforcement agencies were overwhelmed while ""health authorities are seriously under-resourced and have limited capacity to offer treatment"", he added. 
Regional police and analysts told Reuters that organized crime groups exploit the semi-lawless northern Myanmar borderlands, doing deals with the multitude of ethnic armed gangs and state-sponsored militias who control territory there.
The ONCB's Niyom said 8 tonnes of crystal meth had been captured en route to southern Thailand and the border with Malaysia in 2018. From there, ""it was on its way to other markets"", he said.
In the past year, police have intercepted boats laden with meth that left the Malaysian city of Penang. Syndicates also use ""motherships"" that pick up the drugs in the Andaman Sea and distribute them as far afield as Australia and New Zealand. 
Meth from Myanmar has also been found smuggled in shipping containers in the Philippines and Malaysia.
According to regional anti-drugs police, who spoke on condition of anonymity, chemists are brought in from Taiwan and China to run the meth labs in Myanmar, while the precursors and lab equipment mostly come from China.
Last month, Myanmar's military intercepted state-of-the-art laboratory equipment near Muse, a city in Shan state on the Chinese border.
Regional police say the crystal meth produced in Myanmar is the purest they have seen.
According to an ONCB briefing document reviewed by Reuters, 99.92 percent of the crystal meth seized in Thailand in the first six months of 2018 was 90 percent pure or higher.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than 100 people died in two Indian states after drinking bootleg alcohol, police and media said on Monday, in the worst such case in years.
Many of those who died in Haridwar in Uttarkhand state and two districts in neighboring Uttar Pradesh complained of stomach pains and respiratory problems, relatives and officials said.
Police have arrested four people in connection with the deaths, Haridwar senior superintendent of police Janmaijai Prabhakar told Reuters.
“Total casualties in Haridwar remain at 36 and right now around 18 people are undergoing treatment,” he said. 
Officials in Uttar Pradesh could not be reached for latest casualty figures on Monday, but at least 69 people have died in the state, according to newspapers Indian Express and Times of India. 
Deaths from illegally-produced alcohol, known locally as ""hooch"" or ""country liquor"", are a regular occurrence in India, where many cannot afford branded spirits. 
But the current death toll is believed to be the deadliest outbreak since a similar case killed 172 in West Bengal in 2011.
""He complained of severe stomach ache, so I took him to get an injection,"" the wife of one victim, Hira Lal, told Reuters partner ANI. ""He was better then and slept after coming back home. (But) the pain resumed, so we took him to the hospital again and they admitted him.""

43,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",Support for New Zealand PM Ardern's Labour party surges in poll,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Support for New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party surged in a widely watched poll published on Monday, with the 38-year old premier seen as the most preferred person to lead the country by far.
Since coming to power in 2017, Ardern's coalition government has faced several challenges including weak business confidence, emboldened unions and a slowing economy. However, missteps and scandals by the opposition National Party in recent months have helped it pull ahead of its rivals.
In the latest Newshub Reid Research poll, support for Ardern's center-left Labour Party rose to 47.5 percent while the opposition party fell to 41.6 percent, a record low.
The number of respondents naming Ardern as preferred prime minister also rose by 1.6 percentage points to 41.8 percent, while only 5 percent respondents chose the opposition leader, Simon Bridges.
""This is, I believe, a reflection of us doing the work,"" Ardern told Newshub.
The poll was taken from January 24 to February 2, and has a margin of error of 3.1 percent, the polling agency said.
The numbers put the ruling coalition well ahead of all its rivals before the general election that is coming up next year.
Ardern rocketed to global celebrity as an inspiration for women after her unexpected election win and became only the second leader to give birth while in office since Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto.
While the Labour Party rose in the poll, support for its coalition partner, the nationalist New Zealand First Party, fell to 2.9 percent, which would not be enough to reach the 5 percent threshold it needs to be in parliament.
Labour was cast into government in October 2017 after striking a coalition deal with New Zealand First in the country's German-style proportionate voting system.
The arrangement also relied on backing from the progressive Green Party, whose support was at 5.1 percent in the latest poll.

The coalition government, which brought an end to almost 10 years of National's center right rule, came to power promising to pour money into social services and housing and strike a more protectionist stance by tightening up foreign investment rules.

KABUL (Reuters) - Acting U.S. defense secretary Patrick Shanahan arrived in Afghanistan on Monday and said it was important the Afghan government is involved in talks, from which it has so far been excluded, to end the 17-year-old war.
Shanahan, who will meet U.S. troops and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on his first trip in his new role, said he had so far not received any direction to reduce the nearly 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
He also said the United States had important security interests in the region.
Ghani's government has been shut out of the evolving peace talks between Taliban negotiators and U.S. envoys, with the hardline Islamist movement branding his government a U.S. puppet. Kabul is also concerned that a sharp drawdown of U.S. forces could lead to chaos in the region.
""It is important that the Afghan government is involved in discussions regarding Afghanistan,"" Shanahan told a small group of reporters traveling with him on the unannounced trip.
""The Afghans have to decide what Afghanistan looks like in the future. It's not about the U.S., it is about Afghanistan.""
Shanahan took over from Jim Mattis, who quit in December over policy differences with U.S. President Donald Trump.
He said he could not make any guarantees because U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was leading the talks. 
""The U.S. military has strong security interests in the region. (The) presence will evolve out of those discussions,"" Shanahan said. 
He also said his goal on the trip was to get an understanding of the situation on the ground from commanders and then brief Trump on his findings. 
U.S. officials have held several rounds of talks with the Taliban in Qatar since last year in what is widely seen as the most serious bid yet for peace in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in late 2001.
Both sides hailed progress after the latest round last month, although significant obstacles remain. Those include the involvement of the Afghan government.
The next round of talks is due in Qatar on Feb. 25.
Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said Shanahan's main priority in Kabul should be to address Afghan government concerns. 
""The top priority of Shanahan has to be to impress upon the government that we're going to do everything we can to get you into this conversation,"" Kugelman said.
'LEVERAGE'
Shanahan will also have to grapple with how much allies will trust him. 
Mattis, a former four-star general once in charge of U.S. Central Command, was respected for his deep knowledge of military and global affairs. Shanahan, a former Boeing (NYSE:BA) executive and Mattis' deputy, is seen as a relative outsider in foreign policy circles.
Afghanistan and neighboring countries are also concerned about the effect of a sudden withdrawal of U.S. forces on the region. 
An Afghan official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that even the suggestion of U.S. troops leaving was dangerous.
""Of course it has given leverage to the Taliban, there is no question about that,"" the official said.
Trump has offered no specifics about when he would bring home the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan but has said progress in negotiations with the Taliban would enable a troop reduction and a ""focus on counter-terrorism"".
Shanahan said a withdrawal of about half the U.S. troops in Afghanistan was not something that was being discussed and he had not been directed to reduce troop numbers.
""The presence we want in Afghanistan is what assures our homeland defense and supports regional stability and then any type of sizing is done in a coordinated and disciplined manner,"" he said.
Khalilzad said after six days of talks with the Taliban in Doha last month the United States and the Taliban had sketched the outlines for an eventual peace accord.
He has said since then there had been progress on the future of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
However, the Taliban have put out contradictory information on what timeline the United States had agreed to in any potential withdrawal.
Most recently, a Taliban official said no timetable had been agreed with the U.S. government for the partial withdrawal of U.S. forces.
U.S. officials have told Reuters that, while no formal orders have been sent, the military is preparing for what a withdrawal of about half of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan would look like.
Officials have expressed concern that if U.S. troops leave, Afghanistan security forces, already stretched thin, could crumble. 
Shanahan met with a group of elite Afghan commandos later on Monday and backed using more resources for offensive operations by the special forces. 
""What we see here today is how capability is being generated and the commitment of special forces to fighting the Taliban,"" Shanahan said.

Afghanistan’s highly regarded special forces units suffered increasingly heavy casualties last year as the Taliban mounted major assaults on provincial centers including Ghazni city and Farah city in the southwest.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the popular sister of the head of India's main opposition Congress party, made her political debut on Monday with a roadshow drawing thousands in the most populous state months before a general election due by May.
Congress President Rahul Gandhi pulled a surprise last month by appointing his younger sister a party general secretary. She will also be its face in Uttar Pradesh, the state that sends the highest number of lawmakers to the lower house of parliament and is currently dominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
But a string of BJP defeats in state elections late last year and rising discontent over a weak farm economy and lackluster jobs growth have weakened Modi’s position, which an increasingly aggressive Congress is looking to capitalize on.
The 47-year-old Priyanka - she is usually referred to by just her first name - bears a striking resemblance to her grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and is known for her gifts as a speaker able to connect with voters. Congress hopes that the eyeballs she's able to generate will turn into votes.
""It's like Indira Gandhi has come back,"" said Fuzail Ahmed Khan, 45, a Congress supporter. ""The state's farmers want Rahul Gandhi to be prime minister, Priyanka to be chief minister.""
Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister known as the ""Iron Lady"", was criticized for suspending civil liberties for nearly two years starting in 1975.
Posters of Priyanka lined the streets of the state capital, Lucknow, and hundreds of Congress supporters, accompanied by drummers, chanted her name after she emerged from the airport with her brother.
The siblings later waved at supporters from atop a bus as it slowly made its way out of the airport for the 20 km (12 miles) roadshow.
Congress officials hope Priyanka's entry into politics will improve its chances across Uttar Pradesh, a vast agrarian state of 220 million people that the BJP nearly swept in the last general election in 2014, winning 73 of the 80 seats there.
Although Priyanka has helped manage elections for her brother and her mother, former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, she has never held an official party post until now.
""I hope that we can together start a new kind of politics,"" she said in an audio message shared by Congress.
Since the announcement of Priyanka's entry into politics, India's financial crime-fighting agency Enforcement Directorate has questioned her husband, Robert Vadra, for several hours in a case relating to alleged ownership of 1.9 million pounds ($2.45 million) of undisclosed assets abroad. His lawyer and Congress have dismissed the charges as politically motivated.
Priyanka, who drew more than 42,000 followers soon after joining Twitter on Monday, will spend three days in Lucknow meeting workers from more than 40 constituencies.
Described by Congress officials as a gifted orator and a strong manager, Priyanka has been entrusted with resuscitating the party's organization in the state, where it has endured a succession of crushing results.
From 21 seats in the 2009 general election in Uttar Pradesh, Congress' tally fell to just 2 in 2014.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the idea of targeting a customs union with the European Union, pouring cold water on hopes from some that she could shift her Brexit policy to win over the opposition Labour Party.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but has yet to find a deal which is acceptable to both Brussels and lawmakers at home, raising the prospect of a disorderly exit that could damage the world's fifth largest economy.
Brexit has divided Britain at every level from voters to cabinet, and raised fears internationally that it will weaken the West. Brexit supporters hail it as casting off a failing German-led project.
Last week, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out the conditions under which he would instruct his party to support an exit deal in parliament. Foremost was a demand that May seek a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"".
The EU has urged May to grasp Labour's compromise offer rather than press ahead with her preferred option of getting her own divided party onside by renegotiating a clause in the exit agreement relating to the Northern Irish border.
But May's office published her reply to Corbyn late on Sunday, showing little appetite for a U-turn which would risk splitting her fractious party by ruling out the scope for Britain to strike its own trade deals around the world.
""I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deal?"" May wrote in a three-page letter.
May and her government have repeatedly said membership of a customs union would prevent it having an independent trade policy - something they have promoted as one of the main economic benefits of leaving the EU.
Although May welcomed the prospect of future talks with Corbyn to try and find a compromise, the letter gave no ground on their central point of disagreement.
That leaves May battling to persuade a reluctant EU to look again at the Irish backstop - a fallback policy designed to prevent the resurrection of a hard border in Ireland if talks to find a long-term trade arrangement fail.
Brexit minister Stephen Barclay will meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday ahead of a crunch moment in parliament on Thursday, when lawmakers will try to force May to change course or give up control of the exit process. 

May will promise lawmakers a second opportunity to influence the Brexit talks later in the month in a bid to stave off any rebellion from within her own party by those who fear Britain could end up leaving without a deal.

The World Food Programme grain stores at the Red Sea Mills are enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month and have been inaccessible for more than five months, Martin Griffiths said.
Yemen's almost four-year war has killed tens of thousands of people, collapsed the economy and brought millions of people to the brink of famine.
The U.N. is pushing for the implementation of a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah, the main entry point for most of Yemen's imports, agreed in December in Sweden.
Accessing the 51,000 tonnes of U.N. wheat and milling equipment at the frontline flashpoint is a key aim of ongoing peace talks. 
Yemen's conflict pits the Iran-aligned Houthi movement against a Saudi-backed coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014. 
Negotiations between warring parties last week produced what the U.N. called a ""preliminary compromise"" on how to withdraw troops, although the deal has not yet been finally agreed. 
Griffiths said he was encouraged by the recent engagement of all sides in talks to find a way of accessing the mills. 
""We emphasize that ensuring access to the mills is a shared responsibility among the parties to the conflict in Yemen. With safe, unfettered and sustained access, the United Nations can make this urgently needed food available to people in need,"" the statement said. 

The joint statement between Griffiths and U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said the U.N. was scaling up its operations to provide food assistance to nearly 12 million people across Yemen struggling to meet their daily food needs.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",How Greece's PM hopes to solve his election riddle,"By Renee Maltezou
ATHENS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been implementing his re-election strategy to the letter over the past six months, steering Greece out of a humiliating bailout and resolving a decades-old dispute with neighboring Macedonia.
So far, it isn't paying off. With a general election no more than eight months away, his Syriza party is far behind in opinion polls.
That is despite two signature projects since last summer, evidence that the economy is climbing out of years of depression and willingness at last among investors to lend.
Tsipras was elected as a firebrand leftist in 2015 on a promise to reject the austerity required in the bailout. 
He later caved in to the lenders' demands and has reinvented himself as a conformist. Now, after years of austerity many ordinary voters cannot afford to keep the lights on, others are deeply indebted, and almost one in five Greeks is unemployed.
""Our debt is huge and it's still growing, unemployment is still very high,"" said 30-year-old Athens resident Panagiotis, an environmentalist who works in the private sector.
""The crisis isn't over. That's a lie, we are not fools.""
Sources close to the prime minister say his strategy is only now reaching the point where his government can deliver on its pre-election promises and make amends for bailout pain -- a plan he says aims at ""fair growth"".
Creditors released Greece from its third bailout in August, putting it back on the path to full financial independence.
Tsipras has since used greater fiscal freedom to scrap further pension cuts, cut property and corporate taxes and ease some social security contributions. He raised the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, by 11 percent.
He also wants to extend a reduced value-added tax regime for five islands with huge migrant arrivals in past years, and to make it easier for people to pay off pension-fund arrears and bank loans, government officials said.
Tsipras aims to hire thousands of public-sector workers by 2020 as well as making constitutional reforms to separate the Greek Orthodox Church clearly from the state, important to left-wing voters. 
Moves are also under way to extend Greece's western maritime boundaries to 12 miles offshore from six, two officials said.
This could smooth some nationalist feathers ruffled over Macedonia and enable the creation of exclusive economic zones surrounding Greece, Albania and Italy but it could also inflame tensions with Turkey.
FINE LINE
The latest poll by Metron Analysis, for To Vima newspaper, puts Syriza 12 points behind the conservative New Democracy, whose leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis promises to ease tax and social contributions for businesses and boost investment.
The government aims to shrink that gap before European Parliament elections in May, Tsipras' first official popularity test since winning power. Analysts say he may opt for a snap vote if the gap keeps widening, though he has repeatedly ruled that out. His term expires in October.
""We want to ... showcase that Greece has returned to normality,"" one of the government officials said. ""The aim is to shrink the gap in the EU election to be able to win a national vote later in the year.""
His government has a razor-thin majority in parliament, beating a censure motion last month by a single vote with support from independent lawmakers, after his right-wing coalition ally resigned over the Macedonia name accord.
The neighboring ex-Yugoslav state agreed to rename itself North Macedonia to ease Greek fears that the old name implied a sovereignty claim over its northern province of Macedonia.
The deal proved unpopular for Tsipras at home, where tens of thousands of protesters condemned his decision to sanction the continued use of the word Macedonia.
However, the deal appears to have won him respect from the European Union, Greece's major bailout creditor. It opens the way for the EU to start accession talks with the Balkan state and continue the bloc's expansion eastward.
BAD ATMOSPHERE
The question now is whether Tsipras has built up enough goodwill with EU partners to further loosen the purse strings to win over voters.    
Despite the end of the bailout, Athens has agreed to meet specific surplus targets, tied to potential debt relief. Its lenders are also monitoring its progress to decide whether to disburse million of euros in bond profits.
Euro zone officials note that although Greece is expected to exceed its fiscal targets this year its reform progress is low. 
Tsipras' cabinet applauded him when he announced the minimum wage raise last week, but a meeting of euro zone deputy finance ministers gave it a cooler reaction a few days later. 
""The atmosphere ... was not very positive,"" said a euro zone official.
""Greece is moving back in many areas. The general political feeling is of course positive about Tsipras and what he did about Macedonia, but this is not the markets, you cannot trade one thing for the other.""
One euro zone official said a late February progress report on Greek reforms ""did not look good"". 
A negative EU report could unnerve markets -- destabilizing another plank of Tsipras' re-election strategy: the need for calm financial markets. Greece successfully tapped bond markets with a five-year bond last week, its first issue post-bailout, and plans more bond issues this year.
""There is a fine line that Greece needs to make sure it doesn't cross,"" said associate director at IHS Markit Economics Diego Iscaro. ""Markets understand it's a pre-election period but Athens needs to build a post-bailout reputation of reforms.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An elderly man suffering Parkinson's Disease and dementia was given 10 times his medication and had unexplained bruising when he died at an Australian aged care facility, his widow told an inquiry into the A$20 billion ($14 billion) aged care sector.
A Royal Commission inquiry into Australia's aged care industry began hearings on Monday, after a slew of reports of dementia patients being bound in restraints, assaults on patients, overdosing, predatory pricing and poor care.
The inquiry's first witness Barbara Spriggs, whose husband died in 2016 at the Oakden Older Persons Mental Health Service in South Australia, said she does not know why her husband died.
""He had been over-medicated, had severe bruising, was dehydrated and suffering from pneumonia. To this day, I don't know what happened to Bob,"" Spriggs told in the inquiry in Adelaide, in the state of South Australia.
Spriggs said the center was in an obvious state of disrepair but her family had little choice in keeping her husband there as she was unable to care for him at home.
""The facility at Oakden was like something out of the 19th century,"" she said. 
""Bob was lying on a bed with just a sheet underneath him, there was no seat on the toilet, only paper towels in the bathroom. It was like a prison.""
Shares in the four largest listed operators, Aveo Group, Estia Health Ltd, Japara Healthcare Ltd and Regis Healthcare Ltd, previously seen as an attractive exposure to Australia's ageing population, have plunged since the inquiry was announced last September. 
They have each shed at least a fifth of their value, wiping almost A$1 billion from their cumulative market capitalization. 
Unlisted players, such as Bupa Aged Care Holdings Pty Ltd, the country's largest aged care operator by market share, have also been the subject of upsetting revelations and are in damage control.
The Royal Commission, which will sit for 16 rounds of public hearings, is expected to hear harrowing testimony from the families of aged care patients, as well as testimony from industry leaders.
Counsel assisting the Royal Commission, Peter Gray, said he had received responses from about 900 of Australia's 2,000 approved aged care providers, along with more than 800 submissions from the public. Many of the public submissions directly related to substandard or unsafe care.
The government-sanctioned inquiry is due to provide an interim report by Oct. 31 and a final report before the end of April 2020.

The flight, with about 270 passengers, left Auckland shortly before midnight on Saturday but turned around several hours into the journey and landed in New Zealand on Sunday morning, the national carrier, part-owned by the government, has said. 
""I think it is important to be really clear and not confuse administrative and regulatory issues as issues to do with the relationship,"" Ardern told a weekly news conference.
""This was very much an administrative issue,"" she added. ""There’s an expectation that inbound aircraft be registered, that the flight in question had not fulfilled the administrative requirements."" 
China’s foreign ministry has not made any comment yet.
Ardern's remarks came after some politicians and analysts questioned whether the incident pointed to broader issues in New Zealand’s ties to its key trading partner.
""We need to know what has happened here. Is it part of the ongoing deterioration in relations between this New Zealand government and China?"" opposition National Party leader Simon Bridges wrote on social network Twitter on Sunday. 
In November, New Zealand's intelligence agency rejected the telecommunication industry's first request to use Chinese telecoms giant Huawei's equipment in its planned 5G mobile network, citing national security concerns.
That followed a defence policy statement in July, in which New Zealand said China’s rising influence in the South Pacific could undermine regional stability, and alluded to tension in the disputed South China Sea, sparking complaint from China.
""There’s a heightened degree of sensitivity around the relationship right now,"" said David Capie, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University of Wellington.
""On a range of issues with China this government has signalled it’s taking a different stance to its predecessor, so I think people are waiting to see if and how Beijing responds.""

The rescheduled flight landed in Shanghai on Monday, data from flight tracking website FlightAware shows.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 12:59AM ET</span>",Australian government set for crushing election defeat: poll,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's conservative government is facing a huge electoral defeat as it heads into the final sitting of parliament ahead of a national election expected in May, a widely watched poll found on Monday.
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper showed opposition Labor retained a lead of 53 percent to 47 percent over the Liberal-National government led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, unchanged from the previous poll in December, despite recent efforts to frighten voters on Labor's tax plans.
The poll came out as parliament returns this week from its summer break, with the minority government facing defeat on two issues due on the floor as it is dependent on seven independents to vote with it.
The government is looking to block a bid, led by an independent, to allow asylum seekers in offshore camps to come to Australia for medical treatment, saying migrants could exploit it as a way into the country.
Both major parties have long backed tight border protection, looking to keep asylum seekers that arrive by boat out of the country, but Labor has indicated it might back the ""Medivac"" bill, which would land an embarrassing defeat of the government in parliament. 
The government is also looking to stop Labor's effort to extend this sitting of parliament to deal with recommendations released last week from a landmark inquiry into misconduct in the banking industry.
Defeat in either would not trigger an election.
Over the parliamentary break, Morrison has been traveling around the country attacking plans by Labor to cut some dividend tax benefits, which could hit pensioners, but Newspoll found the tax attacks had failed to beef up support for the government.
The latest poll found 44 percent of voters opposed abolishing the tax refunds on dividend credits, down from 48 percent in December.
The survey was conducted from Feb. 7 to 10, with 1,567 interviews and a sampling error of 2.5 percentage points.
Morrison declined to comment on the poll on Monday. Delivering a speech in Canberra, the prime minister sought to persuade voters that the ruling coalition's national security policy was more robust than the opposition's.

""Under my government, Australia will be stronger. Under Bill Shorten's Labor government, Australia will be weaker,"" Morrison said.

Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war and the two sides are trying to hammer out a deal ahead of a March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent.
Escalating tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and roiled global financial markets.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two guided-missile destroyers traveled within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.
The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing's efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate.
China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands.
China and the United States have repeatedly traded barbs in the past over what Washington says is Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs.
China defends its construction as necessary for self-defense and says it is the United States that is responsible for ratcheting up tensions in the region by sending warships and military planes close to islands Beijing claims.
Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan have competing claims in the region. 
Fears have grown in recent months that the U.S.-China trade dispute is just one element in a bilateral relationship that is fast cooling across the board, with top U.S. administration officials sharply criticizing Beijing for everything from human rights abuses to cyber espionage in the United States.
The two countries are also at odds over regional security, including Washington’s overtures to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2019 10:41PM ET</span>",Singapore's aged in line for pre-election budget bonus,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's elderly are primed to benefit from a generous budget unveiled next week, analysts say, as the government prioritizes the needs of a fast-ageing population ahead of an election expected as soon as this year. 
As pressure grows on more of the elderly to stay in the workforce beyond retirement age, the low-tax finance hub is set to try and assuage rising social angst over the welfare of a generation born near the end of British colonial rule when Singapore was a basic port town. 
The Feb 18. budget, due to be delivered by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, will be his first since he was picked last year as the likely next leader of the People's Action Party which has governed the affluent city-state for over half a century.
""Expectations are for a spending spree ahead of a reported early election later this year,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's ASEAN economist Mohamed Faiz Nagutha.
Singapore must hold its next general election by early 2021, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, eyeing retirement, has suggested it could be this year.
Analysts say other highlights of the budget for fiscal year 2019 that begins April 1 will likely include increased security spending given a recent high-profile cyber attack, maritime tensions with Malaysia and plans to acquire F-35 fighter jets. A new sugar tax, higher alcohol levies and more e-commerce taxes are also seen as possibilities. 
""AMPLE ROOM""
While Singapore budgeted for a small deficit in fiscal year 2018, analysts at Maybank Kim Eng said their estimates for an accumulated S$19 billion fiscal surplus over the last three years provides ""ample room for more social spending"".
Other analysts say increased spending is also needed to tackle heightened external pressure on the economy, including from the U.S.-Sino trade war and Britain's imminent departure from the European Union.
""Notwithstanding the prospect of a pre-election budget, the need remains for Singapore to stay business relevant and education supportive amidst the ongoing uncertainties in the global economic space,"" UOB economist Barnabas Gan said, adding the budget needs ""to lean towards an expansionary stance.""
Schemes to retrain and upskill workers, especially older staff and those facing technological disruption, will also likely feature in the budget, analysts say. 
Giveaways to households, direct or through rebates, historically occur before elections. But the government has marked Singaporeans born in the 1950s - the so-called Merdeka or 'Independence' generation - for special treatment this year.
With the second-fastest ageing population in the world after South Korea, Singapore is growing more reliant on older residents staying in the workforce beyond retirement age as birth rates fall and foreign labor is restricted.
But many complain the government's retirement savings scheme does not provide enough money in a country often ranked as the world's most expensive and where life expectancy is close to 83 - the third highest globally.
Ahead of the 2015 election - which the PAP won comfortably - a ""Silver Support"" scheme was introduced to provide regular payouts to low income pensioners, while a S$9 billion ""Pioneer"" scheme was unveiled for all Singaporeans born in 1949 or before to help meet their healthcare costs. 
Analysts think a similar amount will be set aside for the Merdeka generation - in what Maybank Kim Eng in a note said would be the ""centerpiece"" of the fiscal 2019 budget.
While the welfare needs of its ageing population has put a strain on Singapore's low tax model, little is expected in terms of tax changes given last year's announcement that goods and services taxes (GST) will increase between 2021 and 2025.
However, with a so-called 'Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tax' on digital services set to come in next year, some analysts expect imports of online goods to soon be taxed as purchases on the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba's platforms surge. 

A sugar tax - already adopted in France, Britain, Thailand and the Philippines - is also seen as a possibility given Singapore's high rates of diabetes, as is another increase in alcohol tax which was last raised five years ago.

ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - The United States is likely just weeks away from starting the withdrawal of ground troops from Syria ordered by President Donald Trump, the top U.S. commander overseeing American forces in the Middle East said on Sunday.
U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. Central Command, cautioned that the exact timing would depend on the situation in Syria, where U.S.-backed fighters have launched a final assault against Islamic State enclaves near the Iraqi border.
The U.S. military has already started withdrawing equipment from Syria. Asked whether the withdrawal of America's more than 2,000 troops would begin in days or weeks, Votel said: ""Probably weeks. But again, it will all be driven by the situation on the ground.""
""In terms of the withdrawal ... I think we're right on track with where we wanted to be,"" Votel told reporters traveling with him during a trip to the Middle East. 
""Moving people is easier than moving equipment and so what we're trying to do right now is again (to) kind of clear out those materials, that equipment, that we do not need.""
Trump's surprise announcement in December that he was withdrawing American troops from Syria helped trigger the resignation of his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and sent U.S. military officials scrambling to construct a withdrawal plan that preserves as many gains as possible.
Hundreds of additional troops have been sent to Syria to facilitate the withdrawal.
U.S. officials have long estimated that the Syria pullout could take until sometime in March or April to execute fully, but have been reluctant to set an exact timeline given hard-to-predict battlefield conditions.
Votel did not speculate about when the drawdown would be completed.
IRAQ TROOPS STEADY
One big question has been whether some U.S. forces in Syria might move to neighboring Iraq, where the United States has more than 5,000 troops helping Baghdad fight Islamic State and prevent the group's resurgence.
Votel said he did not believe the United States would broadly increase overall troop numbers in Iraq. He did leave open the possibility of changing the composition of forces to help the United States keep pressure on the militant group.
Referring to future U.S. troop levels in Iraq, Votel said: ""I think it's going to remain more or less steady.""
""This isn't just wholesale -- 'Everybody in Syria move over
to Iraq.' That doesn't make sense,"" Votel said. 
Votel is one of many current and former U.S. officials who have warned of the risk of a resurgence by Islamic State unless the United States and its allies can keep pressure on the group following the U.S. withdrawal. They say Islamic State still has enough leaders, fighters, facilitators and financial resources to fuel a menacing insurgency.
But a clear U.S. plan on how to keep up the pressure has yet to be articulated. It is also unclear whether the United States will be able to satisfy the security concerns in Syria of its NATO ally Turkey without sacrificing the interests of U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters there.
Ankara sees the Kurdish militia as terrorists.
Washington views the Kurdish militia as loyal partners in the fight against Islamic State, whose help will likely continue to be needed to prevent the group's resurgence.
The Pentagon's own internal watchdog released a report last week warning about the risks still posed by Islamic State. It cautioned that, absent sustained pressure, the group would likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months and retake some
limited territory.
A U.N. report seen by Reuters last week estimated there are up to 18,000 Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreign fighters. It warned the group was interested in attacking aviation and using chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials.

Australia selected the French builder as its preferred bidder for the fleet of submarines in 2016 ahead of other offers from Japan and Germany.
However, final contracts were delayed amid domestic media reports of cost blowouts and production delays.
Australia and Naval Group signed a Strategic Partnering Agreement, the overall contract to guide the construction, to end the impasse.
""This means we are ensuring we are at the front of the pack when it comes to the latest naval vessels and firepower,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Australia's 12 new submarines are at the center of its plan to significantly expand its military to protect strategic and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The first of the new submarines is scheduled to be delivered in the early 2030s and the final vessel during the 2050s.
Australia rejected offers from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, as well as Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG, when it accepted the French bid.

Williamson will outline plans to send its new aircraft carrier to the Pacific, invest in offensive cyber capabilities and adopt a harder military stance after Brexit than it has done in recent years.
""Brexit has brought us to a great moment in our history. A moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass,"" Williamson will say in a speech in London.
He will describe the boundaries between peace and war as becoming ""blurred"" and say that Britain and its allies had to be ready ""to use hard power to support our interests"".
Britain is in the midst of its most severe political crisis since World War Two as Prime Minister Theresa May scrambles to find a last-minute agreement on leaving the European Union with only weeks until it is due to end over four decades of political and economic integration in Europe.
Brexit has been seen as a blow to the West, already struggling to assimilate Russian and Chinese power as well as Donald Trump's unpredictable U.S. presidency. Brexit supporters hail it as a chance for Britain to take on a new global role.
""We can build new alliances, rekindle old ones and most importantly make it clear that we are the country that will act when required. And, a nation that people can turn to when the world needs leadership,"" Williamson will say.
He will announce that the first mission of the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier will include work in the Mediterranean, Middle East and Pacific regions, and the vessel would carry two squadrons of British and U.S. F-35 jets.
Williamson will highlight close U.S.-UK military links and echo Trump's call for NATO countries to increase their spending, citing a need to better handle what Williamson called Russian provocation.
Moscow's relations with the West are strained over issues including Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, allegations of meddling in the last U.S. presidential election and being behind a nerve agent attack in Britain.
""Such action from Russia must come at a cost,"" Williamson will say in the speech, extracts of which were seen by Reuters.
Without citing specific examples he will warn that the cost of non-interventions has often been ""unacceptably high"" and say that Western powers cannot ignore those in need.
“To talk but fail to act risks our nation being seen as little more than a paper tiger,” he will say.

In 13 of 26 countries, people listed climate change as the top global threat, with the Islamic State militant group topping the list in eight and cyber attacks in four, the non-profit, non-partisan Pew Research Center said in its report.
Worries about climate change have increased sharply since 2013, with double-digit percentage point increases seen in countries including the United States, Mexico, France, Britain, South Africa and Kenya, according to the poll of 27,612 people conducted between May and August, 2018.
North Korea's nuclear program and the global economy were also significant concerns, while respondents in Poland named Russian power and influence as the top threat.
The largest shift in sentiment centered on the United States, it said, with a median of 45 percent of people naming U.S. power and influence as a threat in 2018, up from 25 percent in 2013, when Barack Obama was U.S. president.
In 10 countries, including Germany, Japan and South Korea, roughly half of respondents or more saw U.S. power and influence as a major threat to their nation, up from eight in 2017 and three in 2013, the poll showed. 
In Mexico, where those concerns have spiked since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, the percentage jumped to 64 percent, the poll showed. 
Trump has railed against illegal migration and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and is pressing to build a wall between the two countries.
In 2018, a median of 61 percent of respondents across all countries represented viewed cyber attacks as a serious concern, up from 54 percent in 2017. 

The number of countries that saw Islamic State as a threat fell by double-digit percentage points in Israel, Spain, the United States and Japan.

Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with parallel administrations and armed groups carving the nation into swathes of control.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) began an offensive in the south last month to fight militants and take control of oil installations, and this week banned flights without its permission.
In a statement, the LNA said it scrambled a jet after a plane took off from the El Feel oilfield without permission, and forced it to land near Sabha, the largest town in south Libya. 
It was allowed to continue to Tripoli, seat of the internationally-recognised government, after inspection.
The Tripoli government protested against the interception, saying the Libyan Airlines plane was carrying oil workers.
The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the eastern city of Benghazi, wants to secure the El Sharara oilfield, Libya's largest, and occupied a pumping station 20km (12 miles) away on Wednesday, according to a field engineer.
The Tripoli government, striving to reassert its former control of El Sharara, has sent troops there, a source from the administration said. 
El Sharara has been shut since December when local tribesmen and state guards seized it.

The protesters chanted: ""Long live the struggle of Sudanese women"", and ""Down, that's it"", one of the main slogans calling for the fall of President Omar al-Bashir during protests that have swept Sudan since Dec. 19.
Security forces at the protest, in Omdurman, Sudan's second-largest city which faces the capital Khartoum on the other side of the River Nile, were seen arresting young women and taking them away in at least four pick-up trucks. 
The protesters were trying to march towards a large women's prison before security forces moved in. 
The protests that have spread across Sudan were triggered by a worsening economic crisis and have built into the most sustained period of unrest since Bashir came to power three decades ago.
Bashir and senior officials have adopted more conciliatory language about the demonstrations, including promises to release jailed protesters, but security forces have continued to break up rallies and arrest people. 
In Omdurman's Wad Nubawi neighborhood on Sunday, protesters blocked a road, setting fire to branches and throwing stones before security forces fired tear gas to disperse them. 

Dozens of doctors also protested inside the state hospital in El-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, about 360 km (220 miles) southwest of Khartoum, calling for Bashir to step down, witnesses said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday offered the Taliban the possibility of opening an office in Afghanistan but the proposal was swiftly spurned by the group that is determined to keep his government out of accelerating peace talks.
Ghani has expressed alarm at the Taliban shutting his administration out of negotiations with the United States as well as recent Moscow talks with Afghan opposition politicians, and repeated earlier offers to give the group a secure official address to aid any future diplomacy between the two sides. 
""If the Taliban want an office, I will give it to them in Kabul, Nangarhar or Kandahar by tomorrow,"" Ghani said while visiting the province of Nangarhar, a hotbed of insurgent violence on the border with Pakistan.
""We will bring a lasting and honorable peace to the country,"" he said.
Nangarhar is a stronghold of the Taliban, the hardline Islamist movement that now controls or contests districts across nearly half the country, more than 17 years since they were toppled from power.
Taliban officials in Moscow last week stressed the importance of a formal office among a string of demands that included the removal of Western sanctions and travel bans on Taliban members, prisoner releases and an end to ""propaganda"" against the group.
Taliban spokesman Sohail Shahin later told Reuters that the focus was international recognition of their existing site in Doha, Qatar.
On Sunday he said Ghani was trying to harm the peace efforts with his latest offer.
""Our demand about having an official political office is clear, we want that our office in Doha is recognized by the international community and the United Nations,"" Shahin said. 
""By this, Ghani is trying to change the topic and harm the on-going peace efforts.""
Taliban negotiators are due to meet U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad for another round of talks in Qatar on Feb. 25. The State Department said on Saturday that Khalilzad would spend the rest of the month traveling to Belgium, Germany, Turkey, Qatar, Afghanistan and Pakistan to work on Afghan peace process.
The talks are expected to center around a ceasefire to end America's longest war and the withdrawal of foreign troops. 

Some 14,000 U.S. troops are based in Afghanistan as part of a U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces. Some U.S. forces also carry out counter-terrorism operations.

Teachers went on strike on Feb. 5 after negotiations between the government and public-sector workers broke down, heightening political tension after last month's violent protests that were met by a security crackdown.
Teachers' unions met Education Minister Paul Mavima in Harare and agreed to return to work on Monday.
The two biggest unions, the Zimbabwe Teachers Association and the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Teachers' Union, said after the meeting that the government should take advantage of the ""detente to instrospect and come up with well thought out, meaningful, and long-lasting solutions on the salaries grievances"".
Failure by the government to meet their demands would see teachers going back on strike, the unions said, giving no timeline.
Mavima could not immediately be reached for comment.
Teachers, like other public-sector workers, are demanding U.S. dollar salaries and an increase in allowances to cushion them against soaring inflation and economic hardship.
There are more than 100,000 public-sector teachers in Zimbabwe and unions say 80 percent of them are on strike. 
The unions have accused state security agents of intimidating and harassing their members by visiting schools and taking down names of teachers on strike.
Zimbabwe's government spends more than 90 percent of the national budget on salaries and had promised to reduce this to around 70 percent this year. Demands from workers could see authorities fail to meet their target.

63,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",Madrid demonstrators reject government's Catalonia policy,"By Ingrid Melander and Guillermo Martinez
MADRID (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people waving Spain's red-and-yellow flag demonstrated in Madrid on Sunday to oppose any concessions by the government to Catalan pro-independence parties and to call for early elections.
Demonstrators chanting ""Spain! Spain!"" and ""We want to vote!"" filled the Plaza de Colon in the city center in the largest protest Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has faced in eight months in office.
The opposition center-right and far-right parties called the rally, seeking to make a show of force against Sanchez by capitalizing on anger with Catalonia's separatist leaders and the government's efforts to establish a dialogue with them.
Around 45,000 people attended, officials said. 
The government's proposal last Tuesday to appoint a rapporteur in talks among political parties to address the Catalan independence crisis galvanized the opposition, which has deemed it a betrayal and a surrender to pressure from Catalan separatists.
""The time of Sanchez's government has ended,"" Popular Party leader Pablo Casado told reporters before the protest. Some banners at the rally read ""Sanchez, liar"" and ""Spain is not negotiable and cannot be sold"". 
Sanchez, who replaced a conservative government last June in a vote of confidence, holds just a quarter of the seats in parliament and relies on backing from anti-austerity party Podemos, Catalan nationalists and other small parties to pass laws.
The government is squeezed on both sides of the Catalan issue: Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said on Friday the talks were on track to fail because Catalan pro-independence groups had rejected the government's proposed framework. The Catalan groups want a referendum on independence included on the agenda, which Madrid will not accept.
UNITY? 
Ana Puente, a 73 year-old retiree who attended the gathering, said she was protesting for a ""united Spain"".
""The government is giving many things to supporters of Catalan independence and is going to break Spain apart,"" said Raquel García, 76, who was carrying a Spanish flag. 
Sanchez rejected that argument, telling a separate rally in the northern city of Santander (MC:SAN): ""The government works for the unity of Spain and that means to unify Spaniards and not to put one against the other as the right is doing today in Colon square.""
The protest took place two days before the start of the trial of 12 Catalan independence leaders, who face up to 25 years in prison on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds for their role in a failed secession bid from Spain that they are accused of spearheading in 2017.
The government faces a key vote on Wednesday on its 2019 budget proposal, which will likely fail without the support of Catalan parties. But those parties have said their vote for the budget is conditional on the Catalan talks including the issue of independence, something the government will not include.
Failure by parliament to approve the budget bill could prompt a snap election before the next scheduled vote in 2020. 

Recent opinion polls have shown the conservative Popular Party, center-right Ciudadanos and far-right Vox could together win a majority of seats in parliament if elections were held, allowing them to replace the Socialist government.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) unveiled a position paper on Sunday that calls for more generous state allowances for the unemployed, children and pensioners, seeking to appeal to working class voters in four regional elections this year.
The SPD, junior coalition partners of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, have been debating how to regain the confidence of voters who handed them their worst results since 1949 in a 2017 national election.
Even though Merkel's conservatives are likely to oppose most of the proposals approved by SPD leaders at a meeting in Berlin, there is little risk the blueprint will ignite a crisis in the government.
The proposals are designed to unite the SPD before a regional election in May in the northern city-state of Bremen, where the party has ruled since 1946 and where a loss to the conservatives would seriously hurt its chances of revival at the national level. Opinion polls currently show the SPD one percentage point behind the conservatives in Bremen.
Unveiling the plans, SPD leader Andrea Nahles was careful not to present them as policy demands from the conservatives, who are not as keen on raising state allowances as their centre-left coalition partners.
""This is not our aim,"" Nahles said when asked how many concessions she expects to get from Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party.
""This is about a position paper of the SPD ... and this means we will campaign based on this concept with the goal of convincing people,"" she added. ""But I am curious to know how the conservatives react to it.""
The proposals call for extending the period people may claim unemployment benefits, especially those who lose their jobs in their 50s, and increasing unemployment benefits for parents. They also include raising the minimum wage from just over 9 euros an hour currently to 12 euros.
Both the SPD and conservatives were punished in the 2017 election by voters angry at Merkel's decision two years earlier to welcome almost a million asylum seekers, mainly Muslims from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
THREAT FROM FAR-RIGHT
Both parties have been trying to reinvent themselves to win over voters who backed the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party, which in 2017 entered the national parliament for the first time as the third-largest force.
Merkel's CDU was holding a separate meeting on Sunday and Monday in Berlin, and politicians and experts were expected to debate how integration and immigration policies can be improved.
The SPD's new policies are the boldest attempt yet to undo some of the ""Agenda 2010"" reforms enacted by their own party under then Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over a decade ago.
Those reforms included big cuts to unemployment benefits and gave the Labour Agency powers to force the unemployed to take up low-paid jobs regardless of their qualifications.
The SPD paid a heavy political price, losing a significant section of its working class support base and four successive elections to the conservatives starting in 2005.
The party hopes the new proposals will not only bring back voters but also heal a rift between its leaders and the youth wing, which after the 2017 election had opposed joining Merkel in a third coalition in 12 years.
""Today is a day of the liberation in the recent history of the SPD,"" SPD youth wing chief Kevin Kuehnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper. ""This new concept puts an end to a long period of uncertainty and volatility.""
In national opinion polls, the SPD, which won just over 20 percent of the vote in 2017, has 17 percent support, behind Merkel's conservatives who are on 30 percent.

In addition to the Bremen election, regional votes are being held this year in the three eastern states of Brandenburg, Thuringia and Saxony. In those three states polls indicate the far-right AfD will emerge as the second-largest political force after the conservatives.

The SDF, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, began the assault on Saturday, seeking to wipe out the last remnants of the jihadist group's ""caliphate"" in the SDF's area of operations in eastern and northern Syria. 
The enclave is close to the Iraqi border and comprises two villages. Islamic State (IS) also still retains territory in the part of Syria that is mostly under the control of the Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government.
SDF fighters had so far seized 41 positions but had faced counter attacks early on Sunday that had been repelled, Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, told Reuters.
""The clashes are ferocious naturally because the terrorist group is defending its last stronghold.""
President Donald Trump, who is planning to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, said on Wednesday he expected a formal announcement as early as this week that the coalition had reclaimed all the territory previously held by Islamic State. 
Bali said 400 to 600 jihadists were estimated to be holed up in the enclave, including foreigners and other hardened fighters.
Between 500 to 1,000 civilians are also estimated to be inside, Bali said. More than 20,000 civilians were evacuated in the 10 days leading up to Saturday, he said.
""If we can, in a short time frame, get the (remaining) civilians out or isolate them, I believe that the coming few days will witness the military end of the terrorist organization in this area,"" Bali said.
Senior SDF official Redur Xelil told Reuters on Saturday the force hoped to capture the area by the end of February, but cautioned that IS would continue to pose ""great and serious"" security threats even after that.
IS redrew the map of the Middle East in 2014 when it declared a caliphate across large areas of Syria and Iraq. But it steadily lost ground and its two main prizes - the Syrian city of Raqqa and Iraq's Mosul - fell in 2017. 
Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been the main U.S. partner in Syria. 

A top U.S. general said last week Islamic State would pose an enduring threat following the U.S. withdrawal, as it still has leaders, fighters, facilitators and resources.

Francis was addressing tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) two days after the Roman Catholic Church marked an annual day of prayer and awareness over human trafficking. 
""I appeal, particularly to governments, so that the causes of this scourge are confronted decisively and the victims are protected,"" the Argentine pontiff said.
An estimated 45.8 million people live in some form of slavery across the world, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.
Migration has become a dominant and highly-politicized issue in Europe, though the peak of more than 1 million asylum seekers arriving in 2015 has tapered off since then.
Many migrants arrive via traffickers, often in dire conditions and for large sums of money. 
""We all can and must do more and help by reporting cases of exploitation and slavery of men, women and children,"" the pope added.
Feb. 8, when the Church marks trafficking awareness day, is the feast of Saint Josephine Bakhita, who was born in Sudan in 1869 and sold into slavery as a child by kidnappers. 

After she found freedom, she joined an order of nuns in northern Italy, where she died in 1947.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, whose government backs the powerful Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah, was speaking at Beirut airport at the start of his first visit to Lebanon since its new government was formed late last month.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said last week he was ready to secure air defense systems for the Lebanese army from Iran to confront Israeli warplanes and to secure ""everything it wants to be the strongest army in the region"".
Asked if Iran was ready to offer military aid, Zarif said: ""We always have this type of readiness and we announced on other occasions that this tendency exists in Iran but we are waiting for this desire to exist on the Lebanese side.""
The United States, which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group, says its military aid to Lebanon aims to strengthen the army as ""the sole"" military force defending the country and to counter threats from neighboring Syria.
The new Lebanese national unity government is led by the Western-backed Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and groups most of the main political factions, including Hezbollah, which has expanded its role in the new cabinet.
Zarif, who is due to meet government officials on Monday, said his visit aimed to declare Iran's support for Lebanon and to announce that it ""has complete and comprehensive readiness to deal with the brotherly Lebanese government in all areas"".
In a speech last week, Nasrallah asked why Lebanon was ""ignoring"" Iran while ""offering our necks to others"" - an apparent reference to the United States, which has tightened sanctions against his group.
The make-up of Hariri's government largely reflects the result of a parliamentary election last year, in which Hezbollah and groups that support its possession of arms secured more than 70 of the 128 seats in parliament.

The role of Hezbollah, a heavily armed group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, has grown through its naming of the new health minister - the first time it has controlled a ministry with a large budget.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Officials signed a short-term agreement on Sunday to boost South Korea's contribution toward the upkeep of U.S. troops on the peninsula, after a previous deal lapsed amid U.S. President Donald Trump's call for the South to pay more.
About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, where the United States has maintained a military presence since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The new deal must still be approved by South Korea's parliament, but it would boost its contribution to 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) from 960 billion won in 2018.
Unlike past agreements, which lasted for five years, this one is scheduled to expire in a year, potentially forcing both sides back to the bargaining table within months.
""It has been a very long process, but ultimately a very successful process,"" South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said at a meeting before another official from the foreign ministry initialled the agreement.
While acknowledging lingering domestic criticism of the new deal and the need for parliamentary approval, Kang said the response had ""been positive so far"".
The U.S. State Department senior adviser for security negotiations and agreements, Timothy Betts, met Kang before signing the agreement on behalf of the United States, and told her the money represented a small but important part of South Korea's support for the alliance.
""The United States government realizes that South Korea does a lot for our alliance and for peace and stability in this region,"" he said.
The allies had struggled to reach a breakthrough despite 10 rounds of talks since March, amid Trump's repeated calls for a sharp increase in South Korea's contribution.
South Korean officials have said they had sought to limit its burden to $1 trillion won and make the accord valid for at least three years.
A senior South Korean ruling party legislator said last month that negotiations were deadlocked after the United States made a ""sudden, unacceptable"" demand that Seoul pay more than 1.4 trillion won per year.
But both sides worked to hammer out an agreement to minimize the impact on South Koreans working on U.S. military bases, and focus on nuclear talks ahead of a second U.S.-North Korea summit, Seoul officials said. 
The disagreement had raised the prospect that Trump could decide to withdraw at least some troops from South Korea, as he has in other countries like Syria. But on Sunday, South Korea’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the United States had affirmed it would not be changing the scale of its troop presence.
Trump said in his annual State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday that he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam, following their unprecedented meeting in June in Singapore.
Kim Eui-kyeom, spokesman of South Korea’s presidential Blue House, said on Sunday that President Moon Jae-in would discuss the upcoming summit with Trump “soon” and that U.S. and North Korean officials would be meeting in an unspecified Asian country next week.
After the June meeting, Trump announced a halt to joint military exercises with South Korea, saying they were expensive and paid for mostly by the United States.
Major joint exercises have been suspended, but some small-scale drills have continued, earning rebukes from North Korea's state media in recent months.
About 70 percent of South Korea's contribution covers the salaries of some 8,700 South Korean employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military.

Late last year, the U.S. military had warned Korean workers on its bases they might be put on leave from mid-April if no deal was agreed.

Bezos on Thursday accused American Media Inc (AMI), the Enquirer's owner, of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the U.S. tabloid's reporting on him was not politically motivated.
In a blog post, he alluded to Saudi Arabia's displeasure at the Bezos-owned Washington Post's coverage of the murder of its columnist and Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
He also referenced media reports about alleged links between AMI and Saudi Arabia.
""This is something between the two parties, we have nothing to do with it,"" Adel al-Jubeir told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" when asked if the Saudi government was involved in the Enquirer leaks.
""It sounds to me like a soap opera,"" he said in an interview to be aired on Sunday, excerpts of which were posted on CBS' website. Jubeir said he was not aware of any links between the Saudi government and AMI or its CEO David Pecker.
AMI said on Friday its reporting on Bezos was lawful and it would investigate his claims.

The killing of Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate last October strained Saudi Arabia's ties with Western allies, exposed the kingdom to possible sanctions and tarnished the image of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai political party that nominated a princess as its candidate for prime minister could be banned from a general election in March after an activist said on Sunday he would file a petition seeking its dissolution.
Thailand's Election Commission is to meet on Monday to consider the candidacy of Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, 67, who stunned the nation on Friday when she said she would be the prime ministerial candidate for a populist party loyal to ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
Her announcement drew a swift rebuke from King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the princess's younger brother, who issued a statement hours later saying it was ""inappropriate"" for members of the royal family to enter politics.
The March 24 election is the first since a military coup in 2014 toppled an elected pro-Thaksin government. The current junta leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, is also contesting the race for prime minister, as the candidate of a pro-military party.
The nomination of the king's elder sister, who has starred in soap operas and an action movie and gave up her royal titles after marrying an American, was a shocking move by forces loyal to Thaksin, who face an uphill battle in the election.
The Election Commission has until Friday to rule on the princess's candidacy. It is unlikely its members would disregard the wishes of the king, who while a constitutional monarch, is considered semi-divine in Thai society.
On Sunday, an activist said he would file a petition to disqualify the Thai Raksa Chart party, which nominated the princess.
""The royal announcement made it clear that the party violated electoral law,"" Srisuwan Janya, secretary-general of the Association for the Protection of the Constitution, told Reuters.
Srisuwan said his complaint to the Election Commission would ask it to recommend that a Constitutional Court dissolve the party.
Thai Raksa Chart's executive chairman Chaturon Chaisaeng declined to comment on the request to disband it. The party said it would accept the king's message and ""move forward into the election arena to solve problems for the country"".
The royal family has a long-standing tradition of staying out of politics, and electoral law forbids parties from using the monarchy in campaigns.
Parties loyal to former telecommunications tycoon Thaksin have defeated pro-establishment parties to win every election since 2001, but since 2006 each of their governments have been removed by court rulings or coups.
The gambit to nominate a member of the royal family could backfire on Thai Raksa Chart, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of the faculty of political science at Ubon Ratchathani University.
""Things are now more unpredictable,"" Titipol told Reuters.
If the party is dissolved, it could give more seats to anti-Thaksin affiliated parties like the pro-junta, Phalang Pracharat and progressive Future Forward party, he said. 
Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, lives in self-imposed exile after being convicted of corruption in absentia.
He responded to the events on Twitter late on Saturday telling supporters to ""keep moving forward"" and ""learn from past experiences but live for today and the future"".

(The story corrects paragraph 12 to show that every pro-Thaksin government since 2006 has been toppled, not since 2001.)

Doctors treating two-week-old Abd al-Khaleq and Abd al-Rahim in the capital Sanaa had said the boys could not survive within Yemen's war-ravaged health system and needed to be taken abroad. 
But the airport in Houthi-controlled Sanaa has been closed to civilian flights since 2015 because the Saudi-led coalition has control over Yemeni airspace. Only U.N. planes can land there currently and re-opening the airport is a key aim of U.N.-led peace talks which began with negotiations in Stockholm in December. 
A Saudi organization, the King Salman Center for Relief and Humanitarian Works, had been looking into how to get the boys abroad for treatment, Saudi state news agency SPA said on Wednesday. 
The tiny boys had separate heads but a shared torso. 
In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Saba news, the health ministry said the deaths reflect the health and humanitarian situation Yemen's children are living through as a result of the war. 
Yemen's almost four-year war pits the Iran-aligned Houthi movement against a Saudi-backed coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.

The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, collapsed the economy and brought millions of people to the brink of famine.

The residential building, in the Kartal district on the Asian side of the city, collapsed on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what caused the building.
""An estimated 35 people were in the building according to the information we received. Twenty-one bodies were pulled out of the rubble including a person of central Asian origin,"" Soylu said late Saturday.
Fourteen apartments were registered at the site but the top three floors of the building had been built illegally, the city's governor Ali Yerlikaya has said. A textile workshop was also operating without a license at the entrance.
Seven nearby buildings were evacuated for security reasons on Thursday, while prosecutors in Istanbul carried out an investigation into the cause of the incident.

Search and rescue efforts will continue, Soylu said, adding that rubble was being cleared from the first floor and work would proceed to the ground floor.

More than 6.2 million arrivals were recorded, an increase of 9.5 percent, while there were over 6.3 million exits, up 12.5 percent, it said, citing data from the State Immigration Administration.
Chinese residents crossing the border for personal reasons made a combined 7.22 million entries and exits, an increase of nearly 16 percent over the previous year, Xinhua said.
The growth in border crossings during the country's biggest holiday underscores the rise of Chinese tourism and comes in spite of a slowing economy.
Top overseas destinations for Chinese residents this Lunar New Year were Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, Xinhua reported.
In 2017, Chinese people made 143 million international tourist trips and were the world's biggest spenders on international tourism, the United Nations World Tourism Organization said.

The Lunar New Year holiday is one of China's longest breaks and over 400 million people - more than a quarter of the population - had been expected to travel domestically for family reunions, according to Chinese travel agency Ctrip.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister and top colleagues campaigned over the weekend to block a bid to allow asylum seekers in offshore camps to come to Australia for medical treatment, saying tough rules on migrants should not be eased.
Under Australia's immigration policy, asylum seekers intercepted at sea are sent to camps in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Nauru, and they cannot set foot in Australia, even if they are found to be refugees.
Opponents of the policy have introduced a bill to amend the Migration Act to enable the temporary transfer of ""transitory persons"" from PNG or Nauru to Australia for medical assessment.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has voiced its support for the bill, but the government fears it would open a loophole that asylum-seekers could exploit.
""We cannot have Australia’s borders determined by panels of medical professionals,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a news conference on Saturday.
Defence Minister Christopher Pyne and Immigration Minister David Coleman also voiced their opposition to the bill.
Pyne said the government would be forced to reopen a detention center on remote Christmas Island, at a cost of A$1.4 billion ($992.32 million), if the bill passed as almost all the 1,000 asylum-seekers in PNG and Nauru would come to Australia for medical assessment.
""They'll be coming to Australia one way or the other saying that they have a need to because of ill-health,"" Pyne said in an ABC television interview on Sunday.
Coleman said the change would bring a return of the days when thousands of asylum-seekers traveled to Indonesia and then paid smugglers to take them on to Australia by boat.
Many drowned when their boats ran into trouble.
""We are talking about a catastrophic failure under the previous government where 1,200 people drowned at sea, where 50,000 people arrived and 8,000 children were forcibly placed into detention,"" he said in a Sky News interview.
AMA President Tony Bartone said in an emailed statement to Reuters the government should set up ""appropriate mechanisms"" to allow the temporary transfer to Australia ""for those in need of urgent care"".
Parliament could vote on the amendment when it resumes on Tuesday. The ruling coalition could lose the vote as it is clinging to power with the support of seven independents.

The government is battling to improve its popularity ahead of a general election that must be held by May.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai turned back several hours into its journey on Sunday after discovering it did not have permission to land in China, the airline said.
Flight NZ289 carrying about 270 passengers left Auckland shortly before midnight on Saturday only to return about 10 a.m. on Sunday (2100 GMT Saturday). It turned around several hours into the flight.
""A technicality meant the particular aircraft operating this service did not have Chinese regulatory authority to land in China,"" the airline said.
China's foreign ministry did not make any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. Calls to the civil aviation administration were not answered.
Air New Zealand apologized to passengers and said a special service would fly them to Shanghai at 11 p.m. on Sunday (1000 GMT).
""We know customers will be deeply disappointed and frustrated by this situation and we are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans,"" Air New Zealand said.
Disgruntled passengers voiced their disapproval on social media. One posted a picture on Twitter of the onboard flight map showing the aircraft turning around over Papua New Guinea.
""I've just experienced a new level of China Bad: midway through our flight from Auckland to Shanghai, the pilot informs us that Chinese authorities had not given this plane permission to land, so we needed to turn around. A permitting issue, supposedly,"" the passenger commented.
The same flight, NZ289, was turned back on a flight to China on Aug. 24 last year, although an airline spokeswoman said that was due to an engineering issue, not a permitting one.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Strong winds on Sunday are expected to fan forest fires that have been burning for a week through New Zealand's South Island, forcing thousands of people from their homes, with more residents expected to flee, officials said.
The Pigeon Valley fire covers 2,300 ha (5,700 acres) with a 25 km (15 mile) perimeter, NZ Civil Defence said in a statement on its website.

PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela's Pemon, an indigenous people living along the border with Brazil, are determined to allow into the embattled country any foreign aid that may arrive, even if that means a showdown with Venezuelan security forces and the government of President Nicolas Maduro.
Amid a hyperinflationary economic collapse that has caused malnutrition and the exodus of millions of people, humanitarian aid has become a flashpoint in an intensifying political crisis.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido said last week a global coalition that includes the United States was sending food and medicine to collection points in Colombia, Brazil and an undisclosed Caribbean island before delivering the aid into Venezuela.
Brazil has joined the United states as well as most countries in Latin America and Europe in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate interim leader, arguing that Maduro was re-elected in a fraudulent May 2018 vote.
But Maduro denies there is even a crisis, saying it is part of a U.S.-directed plot to undermine and overthrow his government.
Six leaders of the Pemon community residing in the ""Gran Sabana"" (or ""Great Savannah"") municipality bordering Brazil told Reuters that the population's pressing needs should trump any politicization of humanitarian aid.
The Gran Sabana, a grassy plain dotted with immense tabletop mountains in the southern state of Bolivar, is home to the only paved border crossing between Venezuela and Brazil.
""We are physically prepared - without weapons - and willing to open the border to receive the humanitarian aid,"" Gran Sabana Mayor Emilio Gonzalez told Reuters. ""Neither the National Guard not the government can stop this.""
Indigenous communities boast a greater degree of autonomy than others in Venezuela.
The Bolivar governor and military chief for the region of Guayana, which comprises the states of Bolivar and Amazonas, were not immediately available for comment.
OUTSIDERS EYED WARILY
""We are the natives of Gran Sabana and we will not allow some generals from outside to decide for us,"" said Jorge Perez, the region's councilman for indigenous communities. ""We are the legitimate authorities.""
Perez said he conducts daily visits to the local hospital where patients and doctors alike despaired over the lack of medicine.
""For any emergency, they are taking us to Brazil - it's embarrassing; the hospital of Boa Vista is full of Venezuelan patients,"" he said.
Boa Vista, the capital of the Brazilian border state of Roraima, has received tens of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing turmoil in recent years.
Mount Roraima, standing at over 2,800-meters (9,200-feet) high and straddling the border, is sacred ground for the Pemons and a spiritual symbol for many Venezuelans.
Mayor Gonzalez said authorities in Brazil had not yet informed him of a precise date for the arrival of aid at the border. 
A Brazilian government spokeswoman declined to comment on the issue of aid, but confirmed ground transportation into Gran Sabana was possible.
Venezuela's opposition has so far only publicly announced the arrival of aid in the Colombian border town of Cucuta, where it is now being stockpiled as Venezuelan authorities have made it clear they will not allow it to enter the country.
READY FOR BATTLE?
Pemon leaders said they had already demonstrated their willingness to confront the Venezuelan military over aid after troops with metal barriers blocked the road between the town of Santa Elena de Uairen and the Brazilian border.
The Pemon community, which numbers more than 10,000 in Venezuela, has a history of skirmishes with the military over issues ranging from gasoline cuts to informal mining.
The military was trying to capture a colonel, they said, who had disavowed Maduro and was trying to help coordinate the arrival of aid, adding that he managed to cross the border into Brazil.
The Pemon removed the barriers and had a standoff with the military until the troops agreed to withdraw, they said.
""If humanitarian aid arrives and is prevented from entering, we will suspend the entry of government trucks too,"" said Angel Paez, a Pemon leader from the Akurimo territory of Gran Sabana.

""If there aren't for the people, then there won't be for the government.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The deaths of 10 teenagers in a fire at Brazil’s Flamengo soccer club highlighted the precarious conditions many youngsters face as they chase the dream of becoming professional footballers.
The boys, all aged between 14 and 16, were killed when a fire swept through the Flamengo training center on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro early on Friday morning. Three others were injured, one seriously.
Although Brazilian clubs are famous for producing some of the world's greatest players, they have been criticized for the lack of care and security they provide their young charges.
Authorities have cited clubs in recent years for poor hygiene, inadequate nutrition and a lack of education and social care for youth players.
""At one club I was at we had to wait for the pros to eat and we got what was left and if there was nothing then it was tough luck,"" Romario Reginaldo Alves, a 24-year old forward who spent time at the same Flamengo training ground that burnt to the ground, told Reuters.
""The facilities are not always clean, the toilets are filthy,"" he added of other clubs he was at. ""We know that it’s not like being at home but they can definitely do things better. The clubs and the directors that are responsible need to understand that giving kids decent treatment isn’t spoiling them.""
The boys who died were youth players staying at a training center called the Ninho do Urubu or Vulture’s Nest after the club’s symbolic bird.
In recent years teenagers such as Vinicius Jr., who last year joined Real Madrid for 46 million euros ($52.1 million), and Lucas Paqueta, who last month made his debut for AC Milan, had spells at the same training center.
But the area destroyed by the blaze was not supposed to house players, the Rio de Janeiro mayor’s office said on Friday.
CAR PARK
The area where the lodgings were built was registered as a car park and the city served Flamengo about 30 notices warning them they did not have proper permission and ordered them to close the dormitory in October, 2017. 
""The mayor's office is saddened that its notifications were not observed,"" said Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella. 
He did not say why the city did not close the facility after the notices were ignored.
Many of Brazil’s top clubs have spent money modernizing their infrastructures and Cruzeiro, Atletico Mineiro and Athletico Paranaense have training-grounds and accommodation that rival those of the top teams in Europe.
Flamengo spent 23 million reais ($6.17 million) on expanding and refurbishing the Ninho do Urubu, and the part of the center destroyed by fire was due to be closed down. 
But there is still much work to be done by the clubs and authorities. 
The Rio mayor’s office highlighted problems at the training centers run by two other Rio clubs, Vasco da Gama and Fluminense.
Vasco did not get permission to erect buildings and although Fluminense did receive permission, they do not have permits to allow the buildings to be occupied.
In both cases, city officials are ""taking the proper legal measures"", the mayor's office said.
Neither club responded to telephone calls and emails. 
Flamengo CEO Reinaldo Belotti said the fire was caused by energy spikes that ignited an air conditioning unit.
""When I was there it was much worse than it is now, we really suffered,"" Alves said. ""This was an accident but it has been a long time coming.""

Other defendants received jail sentences ranging from 16 years to six months, state news agency TAP quoted court spokesman Soufiane Sliti as saying. In all, 51 suspects stood trial, of whom 27 were acquitted, in hearings that lasted 18 months.
The assault on the Bardo National Museum left 21 people dead, while 38 were killed in the beach resort of Sousse, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital. Islamic State claimed both attacks.
The twin massacres, which took place within three months of each other, devastated Tunisia's economy - tourism is a major earner of foreign currency that accounts for about 8 percent of gross domestic product - as major European tour operators took flight.
The attacks also acted as a brake on political reforms hailed as a model of democratic transition following its 2011 'Arab Spring' uprising.
Tunisia remains one of the most secular countries in the Arab world, but authorities estimate about 3,000 of its citizens have joined Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya.

Tourists have gradually returned as security has been stepped up, and Tunisia attracted a record 8.3 million visitors in 2018 as hotels were filled with holidaymakers from Algeria, Russia and other parts of Europe.

The fire started in the early hours of Friday morning, a day after a devastating storm struck Rio and killed at least six people.
Belotti said the adverse weather conditions caused energy spikes that could have caused the fire at the Ninho do Urubu, Flamengo's training center on the outskirts of the city.
""It was succession of events after a catastrophic day for Rio that led to this even greater catastrophe,"" Belotti told reporters.
One of the 13 young players to escape the blaze had previously said he fled the building after waking up and seeing his air conditioning unit on fire. Three teenagers were taken to hospital with injuries, one of them in serious condition.
Belotti did not take questions but said a reported lack of permits for the building was not a factor in the accident.
The Rio de Janeiro's mayor's office said in the hours after the blaze that the dormitory was built on an area registered as a car park. The city had warned Flamengo ""almost 30 times"" to close the lodging down, it said.
Belotti said there was no connection between the lack of permits and the fire.
""This area was well known to everyone,"" he said. It was comfortable and adequate. We were proud of it.""
""The truth is that it was a tragic accident. It was not because of a lack of investment by Flamengo, it was not because Flamengo did not take care.""
All 10 of the dead were aged between 14 and 16 and either played for the club or were having trials there, Brazil's Globo website reported.
Flamengo have not revealed information about the players.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A cardinal who was sacked from a senior Vatican post by Pope Francis has written his own ""Manifesto of Faith,"" in the latest attack on the pontiff's authority by a leading member of the Church's conservative wing.
Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, 71, a German who was the Vatican's doctrinal chief until 2017, issued the four-page manifesto on Friday via conservative Catholic media outlets.
He said ""many bishops, priests, religious and lay people"" had requested it. He did not say how many and why he was issuing it now.
However, conservatives balked this week when Francis made the first trip by a pope to the Arabian peninsula and signed a ""Document on Human Fraternity"" with a Muslim faith leader.
Ultra-conservative Catholics are opposed to dialogue with Islam, with some saying its ultimate goal is to destroy the West.
The manifesto was dated Feb. 10, the sixth anniversary of the eve of former Pope Benedict's announcement of his resignation. Benedict, 91, remains an icon for conservative Catholics.
Mueller said he wrote it ""in the face of growing confusion about the doctrine of the faith"".
He said some Church leaders ""have abandoned the people entrusted to them, unsettling them and severely damaging their faith"". He warned against ""the fraud of (the) anti-Christ"".
Mueller, who did not mention the pope, is one of a handful of conservative cardinals who have open accused Francis of sowing confusion.
They say he is weakening Catholic rules on moral issues such as homosexuality and divorce while focusing excessively on social problems such as climate change and economic inequality.
Their leader is Raymond Leo Burke, 70, an American who was demoted from a senior Vatican position in 2014.
Mueller has ramped up his criticism of the pope since Francis removed him as head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2017.
Most of the manifesto was a re-stating of the Church's teachings, including several that Francis himself has strongly upheld, such as celibacy for priests and the ban on women's ordination.
One section, however, was a clear jab at Francis' reaching out to Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church.
Francis believes some should be allowed to receive communion on a case by case basis, something that is anathema to conservatives. 

The Vatican has not commented on the document.

QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began an assault against the final Islamic State enclave in eastern Syria on Saturday, aiming to wipe out the last vestige of the jihadist group's ""caliphate"" in the SDF's area of operations.
President Donald Trump, who is planning to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, said on Wednesday he expected an announcement as early as next week that the U.S.-led coalition operating in support of the SDF had reclaimed all the territory previously held by the jihadist group.
The enclave is close to the Iraqi border and comprises two villages, though Islamic State (IS) also still has territory in the part of Syria that is mostly under the control of the Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government.
SDF official Mustafa Bali, speaking to Reuters, described the assault as ""the last battle"". He later wrote on Twitter that the attack had started and the enclave would ""be cleared soon"".
The SDF had handled the last 10 days ""patiently"" as more than 20,000 civilians were evacuated from the besieged IS enclave, Bali said. 
Senior SDF official Redur Xelil told Reuters the force hoped to capture the area by the end of February, but cautioned that IS would continue to pose ""great and serious"" security threats even after that.
Islamic State redrew the map of the Middle East in 2014 when it declared a caliphate across large areas of Syria and Iraq. But the group steadily lost ground and its two main prizes - the Syrian city of Raqqa and Iraq's Mosul - fell in 2017.
SDF ADVANCE 
Two U.S. security sources said the U.S. government’s top experts strongly believe IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is still alive and possibly hiding in Iraq.
Spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF has been the main U.S. partner in Syria and has driven Islamic State out of a swathe of the north and east over the last four years.
After capturing Raqqa, the SDF advanced southwards into Deir al-Zor province, attacking the jihadists in territory on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. 
The remaining Islamic State territory in Syria is west of the Euphrates.
Trump said in December he was pulling all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, saying the battle against Islamic State there was almost won.
But a top U.S. general said on Tuesday the group would pose an enduring threat following the U.S. withdrawal, as it retained leaders, fighters, facilitators and resources that would fuel a menacing insurgency.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the U.S. military was preparing to withdraw from Syria by the end of April.
A U.S. official confirmed that target date to Reuters, saying the withdrawal included a pull-out from the U.S. military base at Tanf, near the Syrian border with Iraq and Jordan.
The U.S.-led coalition has said it is not discussing the timeline of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria.

Jesus Eugenio Ramos died Saturday morning at a hospital in the city of Emiliano Zapata due to gunshot injuries, the Tabasco prosecutor's office said in a statement. Tabasco Governor Adan Augusto Lopez said he lamented the loss of the reporter, known locally as ""Chuchin,"" and said his murder would be investigated. 
""He was a prestigious reporter ... a program with a long history in Zapata,"" he told news outlet Tabasco Hoy in a video posted on Twitter. 
Ramos hosted the news program ""Our Region Today"" on a local station. He was having breakfast at a hotel near the radio station when he was shot, according to Tabasco Today. 
His death was the third to occur since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office on Dec. 1.
Murders in Mexico jumped by a third to more than 33,000 last year, hitting a record about a decade after the start of a military-led campaign to battle drug trafficking.
Local journalists nationwide have fallen victim to the violence, prompting the Committee to Protect Journalists to classify Mexico as the most dangerous country in the Western Hemisphere for media workers.
Article 19, which defends freedom of expression and access to information, documented the murder of 122 journalists in Mexico since 2000.

Philip escaped without injury on Jan. 17 when the Land Rover he was driving flipped in a collision with a car close to the royals' Sandringham residence in eastern England.
""After careful consideration The Duke of Edinburgh has taken the decision to voluntarily surrender his driving license,"" the royal palace said in a statement.
The other driver, a 28-year-old woman, suffered cuts to her knee and a 45-year-old woman passenger in the car, which also had a nine-month-old baby on board, sustained a broken wrist.
Witnesses said Philip pulled into a main road from a drive.
Philip, who suggested low sun had affected his sight for the crash, also received a warning from police for driving without a seatbelt two days after the crash.
Philip retired from public life in 2017, although he still occasionally appears with his 92-year-old wife at official events.
There is no legal age in Britain to stop driving, but drivers over 70 must renew their licenses every three years.
Philip drove Barack Obama and his wife Michelle to lunch at Windsor Castle during their state visit to Britain in 2016, prompting the former U.S. president to remark: ""I have to say I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before, but I can report it was very smooth riding.""
The queen, a trained military driver during World War Two, is said to have shocked Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah, then crown prince, by climbing into the driver's seat and taking him for a ride around her estate during a visit to Britain in 1998.
At the time, women were banned from driving in Saudi Arabia.

Outspoken yet intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for brusque comments and often headline-grabbing verbal gaffes during ceremonial events.

The Israeli Shin Bet internal security service and police said in a statement that the 29-year-old Palestinian suspect was seized over the killing of the 19-year-old woman during a raid in the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
Shin Bet said the suspect left his home in the Palestinian city of Hebron carrying a knife, saw the victim in the forest and killed her. It was still investigating the motive.
Palestinian authorities did not immediately comment.
Israel's Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said he viewed it as a terrorist attack. ""We're talking about a wide phenomenon of terrorism we're dealing with here,"" he told Reshet TV. 
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and a bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to restart negotiations has so far shown little progress.

PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of French ""yellow vest"" demonstrators marched on Saturday for their 13th weekend of action, with scuffles in Paris and a demonstrator's hand mangled by a small explosive. 
There was also an overnight arson attack on the Brittany residence of the National Assembly head - though no immediate link was made to the actions against President Emmanuel Macron.
The ""yellow vest"" demonstrators, named for high-visibility car jackets, began in mid-November over fuel taxes then broadened into a more general revolt against a political class they view as out of touch with common people.
In Paris, several thousand marched on Saturday beside symbols of power such as the National Assembly and Senate. 
Though mainly peaceful, some protesters threw objects at security forces, a scooter and a police van were set on fire, and some shop windows were smashed.
One participant's hand was severely injured when he tried to pick up a so-called ""sting-ball grenade"" used by police to disperse crowds with teargas, a police source told Reuters.
Another man had blood streaming down his face in front of a line of riot police.
The Interior Ministry put the total number of protesters around France at 12,000, including 4,000 in Paris. The police source, however, said numbers were higher, with 21,000 demonstrators taking part in rallies outside Paris. 
""We're not children, we're adults,"" said Hugues Salone, a computer engineer from Paris, among the chanting and placard-waving protesters. ""We really want to assert our choices, and not the choices of the politicians who do not live up to them.""
Leaders of the ""yellow vest"" movement have denounced the police for injuring protesters, but have also struggled to contain violence from their own lines. 
On some previous weekends, Paris has been a battleground. 
Politicians from across the political spectrum condemned the arson attack on the home of Richard Ferrand, a close ally of Macron and president of parliament's lower house.
He published pictures on Twitter of a scorched living room, saying police found materials soaked in fuel. Ferrand said criminal intent was the likely cause, though the perpetrators' identity was unclear.

""Nothing justifies intimidations and violence towards an elected official of the Republic,"" Macron tweeted in relation to the incident.

The army said it had captured more than 250 rebels from the Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a Libya-based rebel coalition that is trying to topple President Idriss Deby, and destroyed more than 40 of their vehicles. 
The rebels drove about 50 pick-up trucks more than 600 km (370 miles) into Chadian territory almost unopposed before facing several days of French and Chadian air strikes. 
Two intelligence sources told Reuters that only about 100 rebels were being held after surrendering. 
France's military said on Wednesday that its warplanes had destroyed about 20 pick-up trucks after a request from Deby for support.
France sees Deby, who came to power in a 1990 coup, as key to a wider regional fight against Islamist militants. Human rights activists say he has cracked down on dissent.

The besieged Islamic State enclave centered around Baghouz on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River represents the jihadist group's last territorial foothold in the part of Syria where the U.S.-backed forces have been fighting it.
Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, did not indicate how soon he expected the civilian evacuation to be completed. Most of the civilians are family members of IS fighters. 
""There is of course a safe corridor and civilians are coming out daily, and this reduces their number in Baghouz until we can be sure the town is free of civilians.
""We will launch an attack to end the Daesh (IS) presence or they will turn themselves in. There are no other options for them. We confirm there are no negotiations and no intention to have negotiations,"" Bali said late on Friday. 
The United States said on Jan. 29 that Islamic State was expected to lose the final chunk of territory within a couple of weeks.
The SDF, backed by the U.S.-led coalition, has defeated Islamic State across a swathe of northern and eastern Syria. 
After driving the jihadists from their Syrian headquarters at Raqqa in October 2017, the SDF advanced southwards into Deir al-Zor province, attacking the jihadists in territory on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River.
Islamic State still has a territorial foothold in Syria west of the Euphrates in areas otherwise held by the Syrian government and its allies.

The government's decision to award the 14 million pound ($18.1 million) contract in December even though Seaborne Freight did not have any ships had been heavily criticized by opposition politicians and others.
A Department for Transport spokeswoman said on Saturday the contract was terminated after Seaborne Freight's backer, Irish firm Arklow Shipping, decided to step back from the deal.
""It became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements with the government. We have therefore decided to terminate our agreement,"" she said.
The spokeswoman said the government was in advanced talks with a number of companies to secure additional freight capacity -- including through the Port of Ramsgate -- in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
She said no taxpayer money had been transferred to Seaborne, adding that for commercial reasons the government had previously not been able to name Arklow Shipping's involvement.
The opposition Labour Party called the latest development ""a national embarrassment"".
""I do ask what on earth has (Transport Minister) Chris Grayling got to do before he is sacked?"" Labour's transport spokesman Andy McDonald told the BBC.
""This is yet another episode in a long catalog of catastrophes on his watch.""
Grayling had defended the awarding of the contract last month, telling the BBC: ""I make no apologies for supporting a new British business.""
Britain awarded contracts worth more than 100 million pounds in total to three shipping firms to provide extra ferries. The other two -- French firm Brittany Ferries and Danish group DFDS -- are established operators.
Britain's EU membership means that trucks now drive smoothly through border checks within the 28-nation bloc. But after a no-deal Brexit, even a few minutes' delay at customs for each truck could mean vehicles backed up at ports and queuing on feeder roads on both sides of the Channel.
The Department for Transport spokeswoman also said the government stood by the due diligence carried out on Seaborne.
The company had also been criticized when its business terms and conditions showed references to placing ""any meal/order"", prompting speculation on social media that it had copied the format from a takeaway delivery company. Seaborne has since updated its website.
Britain is on course to leave the EU at the end of next month without a deal unless Prime Minister Theresa May can convince the bloc to reopen the divorce agreement she reached in November and then sell it to skeptical British lawmakers.

Modi's visit was part of a series of public meetings in the region aimed at garnering support for his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of Indian elections due by May. 
Despite recent efforts to improve bilateral ties in both countries, disputes over the mountainous Indo-China border - which triggered a war in 1962 - and the region that China claims as southern Tibet have remained a sensitive issue. 
""China urges the Indian side to proceed from the overall situation of bilateral relations, respect China's interests and concerns, cherish the momentum of improving relations between the two countries, and refrain from any actions that intensify disputes and complicate the border issue,"" its foreign ministry said in a statement. 
In response, the official spokesperson at India's foreign ministry said in a statement that Arunachal Pradesh was ""an integral and inalienable part of India"".
""Indian leaders visit Arunachal Pradesh from time to time, as they visit other parts of India. This consistent position has been conveyed to the Chinese side on several occasions.""
Both India and China have sought to rebuild trust after an armed standoff over a stretch of the Himalayan border in 2017.

Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met a number of times last year to give impetus to trade discussions. But progress, according to Indian government officials and representatives of various Indian trade bodies, has been very slow.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 02:40AM ET</span>",Thai princess says #ILoveYou to fans after king opposes her PM candidacy,"By Panu Wongcha-um and Chayut Setboonsarng
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai princess whose stunning announcement she was running for prime minister was quickly opposed by her brother, the king, thanked her supporters on Saturday, saying she wants Thailand to be ""moving forward"", but she did not comment on her candidacy.
Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, 67, shocked the country on Friday when she announced she would be the prime ministerial candidate for a populist party loyal to ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, in a March 24 election.
But her foray into politics - breaking with royal tradition - looked to be short-lived after her younger brother, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, quickly signaled he opposed it, which is likely to lead to her disqualification.
The Election Commission, which is overseeing the first polls since a 2014 military coup that overthrew a pro-Thaksin government, said it would issue a ruling on the issue on Monday.
The nomination of a royal family member by pro-Thaksin forces was an audacious gambit, potentially undercutting Thaksin's ardently royalist foes, and setting up an election showdown with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup and heads the military government.
But King Vajiralongkorn's swift rebuke of his sister's bid could backfire on pro-Thaksin forces, who could face retribution if judged by election authorities to have tried to illegitimately use a royal connection.
""Friday's events were astounding and have people completely rethinking their assessments and perspectives and the country’s future political trajectory,” said Jay Harriman, senior director at BowerGroupAsia, a government affairs consultancy.
""The monarchy has semi-divine status in Thailand. Public appearances and statements often pertain to royal duty or events,"" he added. ""A disagreement like this has almost never happened in recent memory.""
The Thai Raksa Chart party, which nominated Ubolratana as its candidate for prime minister, said it ""graciously accepts"" the king's statement and would abide by election regulations and royal tradition.
King Vajiralongkorn, 66, issued his message late on Friday, saying his elder sister's candidacy was ""inappropriate"" and it was against the spirit of the constitution for royalty to be involved in politics.
While the Election Commission has the final say on approval of candidates, it seems unlikely its members would ignore the powerful influence of the king in making its decision.
'MOVING FORWARD'
In an Instagram post on Saturday, the princess did not directly mention her brother or her political hopes, but thanked supporters for their ""love and kindness toward each other over the past day"" and expressed gratitude for their support for her.
""I would like to say once again that I want to see Thailand moving forward, being admirable and acceptable by international countries, want to see all Thais have rights, a chance, good living, happiness to all,"" she said, concluding with ""#ILoveYou"".
Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the royal family has wielded great influence.
Friday was the last day for parties to declare candidates.
The general election had been broadly viewed as a straightforward battle between Thaksin's populists and their allies, on the one hand, and the royalist-military establishment on the other. 
The main opponent of the princess, if her nomination were to stand, would be Prayuth, who also announced his candidacy on Friday, as the candidate for a new pro-military party, set up by his loyalists.
The princess's nominating party is an offshoot of the larger pro-Thaksin party that was ousted from power in the 2014 coup, and is seen as a back-up party in case the main party is disqualified.
It canceled a planned event on Saturday. The princess had not been scheduled to appear.

Ubolratana relinquished her royal titles in 1972 when she married an American, a fellow student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Peter Jensen. She lived in the United States for more than 26 years before they divorced in 1998.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two Australian divers who helped save 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave have written to the Thai prime minister to ask for the release of a Bahraini footballer with refugee status in Australia, media reported on Saturday.
The case of Hakeem Al Araibi, 25, has drawn international criticism as a Thai court considers an extradition request from Bahrain for him to serve a 10-year sentence related to the Arab Spring uprising of 2011. He denies the charges. 
He was arrested at a Bangkok airport in November when he arrived from Australia with his wife for their honeymoon. He says he faces torture in Bahrain and wants to return to Australia, where he has lived since 2014 and plays for a Melbourne soccer club.
Divers Richard Harris and Craig Challen were honored as Australians of the Year in January for their help to rescue a junior soccer team and its assistant coach trapped in Thailand's Tham Luang cave in July.
They have now joined a growing campaign to press for the release of Araibi, writing a letter to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, ABC News reported.
Challen confirmed a letter had been sent but declined to give more information when contacted by Reuters on Saturday.
A spokesman for the Thai prime minister was not immediately available for comment.
Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne would not comment on the letter when asked by reporters at a news conference in New Zealand, but said the government was monitoring the legal proceedings and assisting Araibi's defense lawyer.
""In relation to our engagement with the Thai government, we have engaged at the highest levels to ensure that Mr Al Araibi is returned to his home in Melbourne, his friends and family as soon as possible,"" she said.
Soccer players and organizations around the world have called for Araibi's release including the sport's governing body, FIFA and the international players' union FIFPro, which represents 65,000 professional footballers.
Bahrain's embassy in Bangkok said Araibi was a fugitive who should be returned.
Araibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station during 2011 anti-government protests in Bahrain and sentenced in absentia after he fled.
He denies the charges, saying he was playing in a televised soccer match at the time of the police station attack.
New York-based Human Rights Watch has said Araibi was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the 2011 protests.

Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.

About 20 European Union nations including Britain, Germany, France and Spain have aligned with the United States in recognizing Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president and pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to call a new election.
Offering a counter-point to Washington's hard-line stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that has kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections.
The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo this week said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis.
Responding to that meeting, China's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday that China supported the efforts of the international community on the peaceful settlement of the Venezuela issue and hoped all parties would continue to play a constructive role.
""Venezuela's affairs should be resolved by its people within the framework of the constitution and the law through peaceful dialogue and political channels,"" the ministry said.
""Only this way can Venezuela realizing lasting stability.""
China has lent more than $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. 
But the financing dried up as the South American country's economy began spiraling downward in 2015, pressured by plummeting oil prices.
Guaido has said a change in government in Venezuela would favor its two main foreign creditors Russia and China, and that he has sent communications to both countries, which have close relations with Maduro's government.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 06:38PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Long a spoiler, Pakistan starts behind-scenes aid to U.S.-Taliban talks","By Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali and Jibran Ahmad
WASHINGTON/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan, long at odds with the United States over the war in Afghanistan, has begun to play a behind-the-scenes but central role in supporting U.S. peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, including by facilitating travel to negotiations, U.S. officials and Taliban sources told Reuters.
The Pakistani assistance, which has not been reported in such detail before, also includes exerting pressure on Taliban leaders who fail to cooperate, including by detaining members of the militants' families, the insurgents say.
Pakistan's role in the peace negotiations is a delicate one, with Islamabad seeking to avoid demonstrating the kind of broad influence over the Taliban that Washington has long accused it of having. Sources caution its help could be temporary.
The Taliban also do not want to appear beholden to Islamabad, which has long denied U.S. accusations that it provides safe haven and assistance to insurgents as a way to preserve influence in neighboring Afghanistan throughout its more than 17-year-old war.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to wind down America's longest conflict, declaring this week in his State of the Union address that ""great nations do not fight endless wars.""
One senior U.S. official, who declined to be identified, said of Pakistan's role in the talks: ""We know it just wouldn't be possible without their support.""
""They've facilitated some movement and travel to the discussions in Doha,"" the official said.
Trump's administration has accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan. U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad held six days of talks - perhaps the most productive to date - with the Taliban in Doha last month and is due to meet Taliban representatives again on Feb. 25.
Speaking after Reuters reported the shift, Khalilzad confirmed at a forum in Washington that ""there is a positive change in recent times"" by Islamabad.
""Pakistan has tried to facilitate talks between the Taliban and the United States and also favors inter-Afghan dialogue including between the Taliban and the (Afghan) government,"" he said.
Taliban sources said Pakistan's role in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table was instrumental. In one instance, Islamabad sent a message to the militants through religious leaders that they had to talk to the United States or risk a cut-off in ties.
They detained Taliban members' families as a way to pressure them, a Taliban leader told Reuters.
""I haven't seen Pakistan so serious before,"" the senior Taliban leader said.
The Taliban leader, who declined to be identified, said Pakistan had kept ""unprecedented pressure"" on the militants and their close relatives over the past few months.
""They made it clear to us that we (Taliban) have to talk to the U.S. and Afghan government,"" the Taliban leader said.
To be sure, current and former U.S. officials still are highly skeptical of Islamabad and do not see any steps by Pakistan that could not be easily reversed. 
Washington appears for now to be sticking to a total freeze in U.S. assistance to Islamabad imposed over a year ago over its suspected support to the Taliban. Trump at the time accused Islamabad of rewarding past U.S. aid with ""nothing but lies & deceit.""
""There's some self-interest obviously involved here ... I would be wary of taking that and extrapolating off that and saying they're now on board with the peace process,"" said Jason Campbell, who was the Pentagon's Afghanistan country director until last year and is now at the RAND Corporation think-tank. 
Afghanistan's envoy to Washington, Roya Rahmani, said that any Pakistani shift in behavior was still not apparent from Kabul, which has yet to participate in the talks.
""For us, it still remains to be seen,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
PULLOUT PRESSURE
Pakistani sources suggest that the driver behind their country's support for the talks is not U.S. aid but growing concerns over the regional economic shockwaves that could follow an abrupt U.S. pullout from Afghanistan.
Those concerns have been strengthened by Trump's surprise decision in December to withdraw completely from Syria, despite objections from the Pentagon.
There are only about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but their presence ensures a continuous flow of U.S. financial assistance to Afghanistan.
Islamabad, running short of foreign exchange reserves and in talks with the International Monetary Fund over what would be its 13th bailout since the 1980s, says it cannot afford to see Afghanistan slide into chaos just as Pakistan is trying to attract foreign investors to shore up its own economy.
""That is our main worry in all of this,"" said a senior official who is closely involved in cross-border relations.
""We have enough economic issues of our own to deal with already.""
One of the most notable public signs of Pakistan's willingness to aid the negotiations was the release of Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. 
Now the newly appointed chief negotiator, Baradar is expected to fly from Pakistan to attend the next round of negotiations in Doha on Feb. 25.
Dan Feldman, a former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said he believed Washington was still hesitant to become too hopeful about Pakistan's change in posture.

""There is cautious appreciation for the fact that Pakistan has seemingly done more than before to be helpful,"" Feldman said, before adding that it did not ""suggest a sea change in Pakistan's position.""

99,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",Border Patrol overwhelmed by large groups of migrant families,"(Reuters) - U.S. Border Patrol said on Friday its resources were being stretched thin by larger and larger groups of Central American families left by smugglers in remote locations along the U.S. Mexico border. 
So far in fiscal year 2019, which began last October, the Border Patrol has apprehended 60 groups of 100 or more migrants, compared with 13 during the entire 2018 fiscal year and just two large groups caught in the 2017 fiscal year, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official said on a call with reporters.
Until recently, most people caught crossing the border illegally were men from Mexico, but now Central American families and unaccompanied minors make up some 60 percent of those apprehended, data from the agency show. 
Facilities built decades ago are struggling to cope with the influx of migrant families, many with young children, who are often in need of medical care. 
""Large bus loads of individuals are being bussed up to the border and we don't have any infrastructure in that area,"" the official said on the call with reporters. 
Many of the migrants who may seek passage with smugglers in their journey through Mexico cross the border and turn themselves into U.S. authorities to seek asylum in the United States, a drawn-out court process that can take months or years to resolve. 
The border patrol official said smugglers drop off large groups as a diversion tactic to tie up law enforcement resources in order to move drugs across other parts of the border.
The Trump administration has tried to curb access to asylum, including by starting a program that would require applicants to wait out their legal proceedings in Mexico. 
Human rights advocates say increased border security and daily quotas put on asylum requests at ports of entry are among factors pushing large groups of migrants to cross the border in risky, remote areas. 
Just how dangerous these crossings can be was highlighted in December when a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died in U.S. custody after she and her father crossed in a large group in a remote area of New Mexico. Weeks later, an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy died after crossing the border with his father near El Paso, Texas.
Overall, illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically compared to previous decades but in recent years the number of families and unaccompanied children heading to the United States has increased.

QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - A Canadian man who gunned down six members of a Quebec City mosque in 2017 was sentenced to life in prison on Friday, with the judge saying he would be eligible for parole after serving 40 years behind bars.
Alexandre Bissonnette, 29, pleaded guilty last year to six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder for the attack, one of Canada's rare mass shootings. 
Justice François Huot said a life sentence with eligibility for parole between 35 and 42 years into the sentence was appropriate, and rejected calls by prosecutors to impose the harshest sentence handed down since Canada eliminated the death penalty.
In the end, the judge said Bissonnette will not be eligible for parole until he served 40 years of his sentence.
The January 2017 shooting, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced as a terrorist attack, provoked debate over the treatment of new arrivals at a time when Canadians were being tested by a growing number of migrants crossing from the United States into the province of Quebec.
Huot said Bissonnette’s actions in entering the mosque at the end of prayers and shooting congregants were not a terrorist attack, but motivated by prejudice, particularly toward Muslim immigrants.
But the judge also said Bissonnette’s mental health issues, including an obsession with suicide, played a role in the shooting and influenced his sentence.
A 2011 legal change allows Canadian judges to hand down consecutive sentences in the case of multiple murders. Prosecutors had asked for Bissonnette to serve six consecutive sentences or 150-years in prison without eligibility for parole, the harshest sentence since Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976.
""The U.S. Supreme Court would not find a 150-year (term) cruel and unusual punishment,"" Huot said earlier in the day, but added ""punishment should not be vengeance.""
Huot also stressed the importance in Canada of rehabilitating offenders.
The dark-haired, slightly-built Bissonnette, who wore a white shirt under a navy blue jacket and handcuffs, had been described by police as a lone-wolf attacker. 
Bissonnette had previously asked his victims for forgiveness when entering his guilty plea in March, telling the court: “I am not a terrorist, nor an Islamophobe.”

But Huot said Bissonnette had previously considered attacking other targets including feminists, shopping centers and airports. The judge recounted Bissonnette’s remarks to a prison social worker in Sept. 2017, when he expressed a desire for ""glory"" in shooting congregants and that he “regretted not shooting more.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's former First Lady Angelica Rivera has decided to divorce ex-President Enrique Pena Nieto, the one-time telenovela actress said in a post on her Instagram account on Friday.
Pena Nieto ended his six-year presidential term in November. In 2010, he married Rivera in a splashy celebration when he was a governor eyeing a bid for presidency. It was the second marriage for both, and each had children from previous relationships. 
Rumors of an impending split had long dogged the couple, intensifying during the final year of Pena Nieto's term, though the family's supporters, including one of Rivera's daughters, dismissed the claims as false. 
""I deeply regret this painful situation for myself and our children,"" Rivera, 49, wrote in her post.
""Today, all my energy, strength and love is focused on remaining a good mother, recovering my life and my professional career,"" she added.
About a week ago, a Mexican society magazine published photos of Pena Nieto in Spain with a young female Mexican model, adding to speculation that the couple might separate. 
Pena Nieto, 52, left office with record-low approval ratings, dragged down by rampant crime, corruption scandals and a lackluster economy under his watch.
One of the first scandals to tarnish him emerged in 2014 when a journalistic investigation revealed that a multimillion-dollar home in one of Mexico City's poshest neighborhoods used by the couple was owned by a subsidiary of a politically connected contractor.
At the time, Rivera said she was purchasing the home from the subsidiary with money earned from her acting career. She later announced that she would sell her stake in the property to put the controversial matter to rest.
For years, Rivera worked for Mexico's biggest broadcaster Televisa on a series of soap operas, and for a time was one of the country's most popular and recognizable actresses.
Pena Nieto has kept a low profile since leaving office, and has not confirmed whether the couple will divorce.

A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NATO members signed the accord with Macedonia this week, days after the Greek parliament endorsed an agreement between Athens and Skopje that changes Macedonia's name to North Macedonia. 
Staring down strong domestic opposition from Greeks worried the Balkan neighbor was appropriating Greek heritage, the government of leftist Greek Premier Alexis Tsipras pushed the name change through parliament on Jan. 25
""I feel we did our patriotic duty.. We did what is right,"" Tsipras told parliament during a debate on Friday. Macedonia's admission to NATO was approved by a slim majority of MPs in the 300-seat parliament.
The row had frustrated Macedonian attempts to join the EU and NATO: Greece is a member of both and has veto power over other countries joining.
It also exposed old rivalries with Russia, in a region where Moscow jostles for influence with NATO and the EU. Moscow had taken a dim view of the name accord, and of Macedonian membership in NATO. It says the alliance is undermining security in the region by taking in Balkan members.

The attack came as hundreds of worshippers tried to march from the Al-Sayed Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi mosque, one of the capital's main mosques, as part of near daily protests against President Omar al-Bashir's 30 years in office.
Sudan has been rocked by the protests which began on Dec. 19 after the government tried to raise bread prices. Rights groups say at least 45 people have been killed in the protests, while the government puts the death toll at 31, including two members of security forces.
The Umma party of former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi said in a statement that security forces attacked worshippers soon after noon prayers, firing tear gas ""extensively"" into the mosque courtyard.
""Firing at the mosque and the vehicle of Imam Sadiq al-Mahdi, beating worshippers, pointing guns in their faces and besieging the mosque... resulted in the wounding of several worshippers, while others suffered suffocation,"" the statement said.
It accused Bashir's government of no longer abiding by the Sudanese people's values as it sought to cling to power.
A police spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment despite repeated attempts to do so.
Bashir has blamed the protests on foreign ""agents"" and challenged his rivals to seek power through the ballot box. He has shown no sign that he is prepared to concede any power.
Protests also broke out in other parts of Khartoum, where demonstrators blocked roads with burning tires and tree branches. Security forces dispersed the protests with tear gas but there were no reports of injuries.
In eastern Sudan, hundreds marched in Khashm al-Qirba, the hometown of a school teacher who died in detention last week after he was arrested for participating in protests.
Demonstrators chanted: ""With our souls, with our blood, we redeem you, teacher."" Security forces did not intervene.
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges, which he denies, of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region. He has been lobbying to have Sudan removed from a list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism.

106,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",Spain says Catalan separatists rejected talks needed for budget,"By Belén Carreño and Jose Elías Rodríguez
MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government accused Catalan pro-independence leaders on Friday of rejecting its attempts to start a dialogue aimed at resolving the separatist crisis between Madrid and the wealthy region.
The impasse comes at an uneasy time for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's minority government ahead of a vote next week on the 2019 budget bill, which is likely to fail without the support of the Catalan parties, and of the trial of 12 jailed independence leaders starting on Tuesday.
Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the pro-independence groups had rejected the framework for talks proposed by the government because they wanted a referendum on independence included on the agenda, which Madrid would not accept.
""For years they have been asking for dialogue. We have done it. If that is not enough, we need to stop,"" she told a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting.
Failure to approve the 2019 budget proposal could prompt a snap parliamentary election this year, which is something the opposition has also called for as part of its sharp criticism of the government's plan to open talks with Catalan secessionists.
The government's proposed framework included bilateral meetings between the central and regional administrations as well as a cross-party coordinator. The conservative opposition has accused Sanchez's Socialist government of giving ground to the secessionists and preparing what they called a treasonous deal.
Sanchez, who came to power in June last year and has been open to giving Catalonia a greater autonomy, said in a tweet the government's proposal for dialogue remained open and his administration was working to ""build all possible bridges"". 
But he reiterated that Madrid will never accept a referendum on Catalonia's independence.
In 2017, Catalonia proclaimed independence after a referendum, deemed illegal by Madrid, leading the previous conservative central government to seize control of the autonomous region. 
Catalonian Vice President Pere Aragones from the pro-independence ERC party blamed the failure to advance on the Sanchez government, which he said had ceded to pressure from the Spanish right and far-right in refusing to even discuss independence.
Catalonia remained open to dialogue, but it ""cannot be expected to renounce the right to self-determination"", Aragones said.
Catalonian government spokeswoman Elsa Artadi said that maintaining a dialogue was the necessary condition for the approval of the budget, and Madrid walking out of it would mean that ""the likelihood of the budget approval is more distant"".

The center-right People's Party, Ciudadanos and far-right Vox have called on supporters to take to the streets of Madrid on Sunday draped in Spanish flags to protest against the government's stance on Catalonia.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Friday the U.S.-backed humanitarian aid being stockpiled in the Colombian border city of Cucuta for his country should be distributed to poor Colombians as Venezuelans are not ""beggars.""
The day after trucks carrying medicine and food arrived in Cucuta, Maduro, who has become increasingly isolated internationally, told a news conference that Venezuela did not need the aid that includes supplies provided by the United States.
""Venezuela will not allow the show of ... humanitarian aid because we do not beg from anyone,"" Maduro told reporters. ""Venezuela is not suffering the humanitarian crisis fabricated by Washington over the last four years to justify intervening in our country.""
Maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the oil-rich OPEC country that has left many Venezuelans malnourished and struggling to find medicine, sparking the exodus of an estimated 3 million Venezuelans.
The dire situation has fueled a political crisis that has peaked over the last month with opposition leader Juan Guaido invoking a constitutional provision to declare himself the legitimate president. He argues Maduro was re-elected last year in a sham election.
More than forty nations including the United States, major European powers and most Latin American countries have recognized Guaido as the country's rightful head of state.
Representatives of the European Union and a group of Latin American governments met in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Thursday to discuss the crisis. 
Their organization, the International Contact Group on Venezuela, issued a statement saying they would send a technical mission to the country to help provide humanitarian aid and support new elections as soon as possible.
""We reject the partisan and ideological nature of the document,"" Maduro said on Friday, adding that he would always welcome dialogue with anyone.
Critics say three previous dialogues have allowed the ruling Socialist Party to stall for time without making major concessions on key issues including imprisoned opposition politicians and electoral transparency.

Guaido has said the time for dialogue has passed.

On Thursday, the New York Times reported that a year before Khashoggi was killed, the crown prince told an aide he would use ""a bullet"" on the journalist if he did not return home and end his criticism of the government. 
Those comments were made in 2017, well before Khashoggi was killed last October in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Times said, citing current and former U.S. and foreign officials knowledgeable about intelligence reports.
Asked about the report, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters: ""I can't comment on reports based on anonymous sources. We have seen in the past that many so-called reports based on intelligence sources have not panned out.""
Asked if he rejected the idea that the crown prince had used the phrase in a conversation, al-Jubeir replied: ""It's not about reject or not reject. We know that the crown prince did not order this. We know that this was a rogue operation.""
Separately on Thursday, a United Nations-led inquiry into Khashoggi's murder said that evidence pointed to a brutal crime ""planned and perpetrated"" by Saudi officials.

Khashoggi's killing by a team of Saudi operatives on Oct. 2 provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of the crown prince, who had been admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive.

Israel's military said it had opened fire in response to explosives and rocks hurled at the border fence.
Palestinians have been staging weekly protests since last March at the border of Gaza, an enclave controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas. The enclave's health ministry says more than 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops at the protests. One Israeli soldier has died.
Gaza health officials said one of the youths shot dead on Friday was 18 and the other 14.
Israel says it has no choice but to use deadly force at the protests to defend the frontier from militants trying to destroy the barrier and infiltrate.
An Israeli military spokesman said troops had faced off on Friday with more than 6,000 Palestinians, some of whom threw rocks and ""a number of explosive devices, which exploded on the Gaza side of the fence"".
The spokesman said soldiers used riot dispersal equipment and opened fired ""in accordance with standard operating procedures.""
Gaza is home to 2 million Palestinians, nearly all of them the stateless descendents of people who fled or were driven out of Israel on its founding in 1948.
Israel and Egypt imposed a security blockade on the enclave after Hamas seized control of it in 2007, which the World Bank says has reduced the local economy to a state of collapse. Israel has fought three wars against Hamas in the past decade.

Palestinians say the weekly protests are led by civil society groups demanding an easing of the blockade and recognitition of their right to return to homes in Israel. Israel says militants use the demonstrations to threaten the border and provoke violence.

Ex-beauty pageant winner Yazmin Morales told Reuters on Friday that Arias forced himself on her at his San Jose home, after he had contacted her via social media.
""He grabbed me, forcibly got close to my body, and then with one of his hands he touched my breasts over my clothes and kissed me against my will,"" said Morales, repeating accusations first reported by Costa Rican media.
""I was in shock. I didn't expect anything like that from someone so well-known and someone I admired very much,"" she added.
Gloriana Valladares, a lawyer representing Arias, said the defense had received a copy of the new complaint after learning about it in the media. Valladares said Arias, 78, would not comment out of respect for due process.
Anti-nuclear activist Alexandra Arce was the first woman to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the two-time president, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role negotiating an end to civil wars in Central America. Arias has denied that claim through his lawyer.
With Morales, at least six women have said Arias harassed or assaulted them in what has become one of the most prominent examples of the #MeToo movement in Latin America.
The Costa Rican prosecutor's office confirmed it received a new sexual abuse complaint against Arias on Thursday night, saying the new complaint would be added to the earlier investigation. Only Arce and Morales have so far filed formal complaints.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Friday called his elder sister's bid to run for prime minister in March ""inappropriate"" and unconstitutional, likely sinking her candidacy for a populist opposition party.
Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, 67, stunned the nation when she announced on Friday she would be the sole prime ministerial candidate for the party, which is loyal to ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, in the March election.
Her candidacy instantly threatened to upend the first national ballot since a military coup in 2014 that ousted a government loyal to Thaksin, the figure at the center of years of political turbulence and rival street protests that have riven Thai society.
But the opposition from Ubolratana's younger brother, a constitutional monarch, is likely to lead to the Election Commission disqualifying her.
Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932 but the royal family has wielded great influence and commands the devotion of millions.
""Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is an act that conflicts with the country's traditions, customs, and culture, and therefore considered extremely inappropriate,"" the king said in a statement.
The statement was issued by the palace and later read on air by a television announcer.
King Vajiralongkorn also cited a provision in the constitution that states the monarch stays above politics and maintains political neutrality. 
""All royal family members adhere to the same principles ...and cannot take any political office, because it contradicts the intention of the constitution.""
Friday was the last day for parties to declare candidates.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who was army chief when he led the 2014 coup and now heads the ruling junta, also announced his candidacy on Friday.

The March 24 election has been viewed as a straightforward battle between Thaksin's populists and their allies, on the one hand, and the royalist-military establishment on the other.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - It's a proposal that is not even on the table, and reverses Theresa May's determined position - but EU officials are still urging her to grasp an offer from the Labour opposition to break an impasse over the terms of Britain's EU exit.
The Conservative prime minister gave no sign during her visit to Brussels on Thursday of softening her rejection of a permanent EU-UK customs union, as Labour proposes, European Union sources said.
But for many in Brussels, the possibility of Labour support for an orderly Brexit that avoids the likely chaos of ""no-deal"" is the only way out of the deadlock, and justifies an attempt to influence Britain's highly tribal internal politics.
""We are still very much in the party politics perspective. The only hope is that, at some point, the threat of 'no-deal' disruptions would mobilize minds in the UK,"" an EU diplomat briefed on May's talks in Brussels said on Friday. 
""For now, May is still looking at her own party rather than a nationwide consensus.""
The EU says London agreeing to closer ties with the bloc after Brexit would largely obviate the need for a contentious ""backstop"" provision in the future, an insurance policy meant to keep the border between Ireland and the British-run province of Northern Ireland open under any and all circumstances.
""We are looking at those proposals with interest but there are obviously very considerable points of difference that exist between us,"" said a senior official in May’s office.
""The PM continues to believe that an independent trade policy is one of the key advantages of Brexit,"" the person said under condition of anonymity.
Staying in a customs union with the EU would limit the UK's ability to seal trade deals with other countries on its own. 
But the bloc believes that solution might be acceptable to the Northern Irish unionists propping up May's government, as well as to at least some Labour lawmakers, and thus secure a parliamentary majority for the divorce deal before Britain leaves on March 29.
Given the EU's opposition to the concessions on the backstop that May is currently demanding, the only alternative appears to Brussels to be a delay to the exit and/or a ""no-deal"" Brexit, with no transition period to soften the economic rupture.
""THE ONLY WAY OUT""
""By that time, hopefully, May will have worked with Labour and get Labour votes. It's the only way out. There will be no illusions on what will happen in the last week of March if they don't vote for it,"" another EU diplomat said.
One senior EU diplomat added: ""Our leaders cannot understand why she still has not been able to do what they do every day – talk to the opposition, build coalitions.""
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he would reiterate on Monday at a planned meeting with Britain's Brexit minister that the EU would not re-open the legally binding Brexit deal agreed with Britain over two years, but was ready to rework the political declaration that accompanies it.
The bloc rejects London's demands for a time limit to the backstop, saying that would defeat its purpose. But it has given May an olive branch, agreeing that Brexit negotiators from both sides will sit down to talks again. 
EU diplomats and officials dealing with Brexit expect it to go right down to the wire. While May has refused to rule out a 'no-deal' Brexit, which she believes gives her bargaining power, Brussels hopes that she would come round to requesting at least a short delay if that scenario seemed unavoidable.
They juxtapose May's brinkmanship with a somewhat unexpected role model - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. 
Long at loggerheads with the EU over Greece's economy and migration, the bloc's former enfant terrible has now won widespread praise in the EU for putting to rest a protracted name dispute with neighboring Macedonia at considerable political cost.

""Look at Tsipras and Macedonia – a leader who stuck his neck out and risked his own government and premiership to do what he knew was right. We need that type of thinking in the UK,"" said another EU diplomat.

116,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",Row with France could lift divided Italian coalition,"By Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition has hit fierce turbulence for the first time since taking office last June, with diplomatic crises, ideological divisions and daily dust-ups taking their toll as the economy tips into recession.
France's decision on Thursday to recall its ambassador from Rome to protest against repeated verbal assaults from Italy's populist leaders has exacerbated a sense of turmoil in Rome and helped further depress already anxious financial markets.
Italy is Europe's third largest economy and has its second biggest debt pile in terms of gross domestic product after Greece, making investors highly wary of political risk here.
Recent ructions have raised speculation that the government might fall apart even before European parliamentary elections in May, long seen as a litmus test for the two ruling parties - the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
But interviews with more than a dozen coalition lawmakers suggest that despite deep, mutual frustrations, neither side expects an imminent divorce, with the French row likely to reinforce their troubled relationship rather than break it.
""We are united in not accepting orders from France, Europe or anyone else,"" Guglielmo Picchi, a senior member of the League and foreign ministry undersecretary, told Reuters. 
""What do you expect? We are in an election campaign where everyone has their own interests.""
Both the League and 5-Star have identified the pro-European French president, Emmanuel Macron, as a natural adversary in their respective EU electoral battles, publicly accusing him of undermining Italy's foreign, economic and immigration policies.
Macron's abrupt decision to recall France's envoy, a move not seen since World War Two, alarmed Italian business leaders but could please League and 5-Star voters, thirsty for change after years of old-style, consensus politics.
""Potentially, this is something that might help the government parties reconnect,"" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, a founder of political consultancy YouTrend. 
""Identifying common enemies always helps bring parties together ... so I don't see this as a major problem."" 
LOOMING HURDLES
By its own admission, the coalition faces myriad other problems, starting with the anemic economy. 
Italy fell into its third recession in a decade at the end of 2018 and the European Commission on Thursday slashed its Italian growth forecast to 0.2 percent this year from a previous estimate of 1.2 percent - the lowest in the 28-nation block.
Anxious not to be blamed by voters for the new downturn, coalition parties hope their big-spending 2019 budget, which includes a new income support scheme, will lift the economy.
""The economy is at the center of our thoughts. We are waiting to see what impact the budget will have,"" said Stefano Patuanelli, the 5-Star leader in the Senate, Italy's upper house.
The impact of the budget will take months to be felt and the coalition faces many hurdles in the meantime, including a fraught decision on whether to press ahead with building a Franco-Italian Alpine rail link, known as the TAV.
5-Star, which has strong roots amongst environmentalists, wants to kill off the multi-billion-euro project, while the pro-business League is determined to proceed, with no sign that either party is willing to back down.
Another divisive issue that must be addressed this month is whether wealthy northern regions in the League heartland should have greater autonomy - something 5-Star fears will suck funds from its southern strongholds.
""If regional autonomy doesn't go ahead as we want ... then I will leave the government. There would be no point in staying,"" said Giancarlo Giorgetti, undersecretary in the prime minister's office and a leading League light.
The future of League leader Matteo Salvini, who serves as interior minister, has become an additional flashpoint, with magistrates pressing parliament to strip him of his immunity to let them possibly press kidnapping charges after he refused last year to let a group of migrants disembark from a rescue boat.
5-Star built its support by denouncing parliamentary privilege and it could take a big hit if it moved to protect Salvini. But League lawmakers question how they could continue to work together if they abandon their ally to the courts.
""This is the most dangerous issue for us. We are in a lose-lose situation,"" a 5-Star minister, who declined to be named, told Reuters.

Such issues would be hard to tackle at any time, but the situation is exacerbated by the fact they are playing out against the backdrop of regional election campaigns and the May 26 EU vote, which gives parties little room to maneuver.
The League has doubled its support to around 34 percent in just a year, lifted by Salvini's anti-immigration stance, while 5-Star has dropped to around 24 percent, down about eight points since national elections last March.
Should 5-Star backing buckle in May, party leader Luigi Di Maio will face internal pressure to quit the government.
Despite all these problems, there is no other viable majority in parliament and voters here often punish parties that bring down coalitions and trigger instability - a compelling reason for 5-Star and the League to cling together.
""I don't think either ruling party has any interest in bringing the government down this year, even less so before the European election,"" YouTrend's Pregliasco said.
When Salvini hooked up with 5-Star last year, he uncoupled the League from its old political allies, the nationalist Brothers of Italy and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy).
The three parties still fight together in local elections and for the first time since last May, Salvini appeared in public with Berlusconi on Thursday ahead of a ballot on Sunday in the Abruzzo region.
News of the event triggered gossip that the old center-right bloc might be revived at a national level, but Salvini openly dismissed the idea and, driving the point home, did not put the event on any of his massively followed social media platforms.
A poll in La Stampa newspaper this week explained his reticence, predicting he would lose seven percentage points if he returned to Berlusconi, a relic of the political past.
""It's clear the situation is a mess right now, but we are moving ahead. The situation is highly fluid ... but we are not yet at a point where the government is at risk,"" said a League politician and deputy minister, who declined to be named.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 10:09AM ET</span>",Ten killed as fire sweeps through Flamengo training center in Rio,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A fire swept through the training center and lodgings of Rio de Janeiro soccer club Flamengo on Friday, killing 10 people, including members of the club's youth side, firefighters and news reports said.
At least three youths aged 14 and 15 were injured in the blaze. All three were taken to the hospital, one of them reportedly in a serious condition.
Firefighters said they arrived at the Ninho do Urubu, a state-of-the-art training center that was expanded and opened only two months ago, shortly after 5 a.m. (0700 GMT) to find the building engulfed in flames. 
Some people had managed to escape, but the ferocity of the blaze prevented firefighters from entering the facility.
""We managed to rescue the victims that were outside,"" fire service Lieutentant Colonel Douglas Henaut told reporters. ""The place was completely overtaken by fire. As much as we tried to get inside and find people still alive that wasn't (possible) ... We only found bodies inside.""
""We can't tell you the cause of the fire, that needs to be investigated,"" he added.
One young player said the fire started in his room. 
""The air conditioner caught fire, and I ran out,"" said Felipe Cardoso, a midfielder with the under-17 side. ""Thank God I managed to run and I'm still alive.""
O Globo newspaper reported the building did not have the correct permits but did not cite sources.
One of the deceased was identified as Christian Esmerio, a 15-year-old goalkeeper.
""I had the pleasure of knowing you, unfortunately an accident interrupted your dream,"" Gabriel Batista, a senior goalkeeper at the club, wrote on Instagram. 
EXPANDED NEW FACILITY
After years of financial difficulties, Flamengo last year spent 23 million reais ($6.2 million) to expand the Ninho do Urubu training ground.
In addition to accommodation for young players, the facilities include several pitches, an aquatic park, a gym, a medical center and a mini-stadium.
The Ninho do Urubu, or Vulture's Nest, is so called because the club's symbol is a vulture.
Vinicius Junior, the teenage Real Madrid forward who trained at the facility before joining the Spanish giants last year, tweeted his condolences.
""What sad News! Praying for everyone! Strength, strength, strength,"" he wrote.
The fire follows days of heavy rains that hit the city and claimed at least six lives. The rains led Flamengo to close parts of its social club and cancel regular training sessions it organizes for children.
Flamengo, the alma mater of players such as Zico, Junior and Leonardo, is one of the best-supported clubs in Brazil and is famous around the world. Known by fans as the Red-and-Black, they won the Copa Libertadores, South America's version of the Champions League, in 1981 and lifted the Intercontinental Cup a few months later.
Zico, who was outside Brazil, wrote on Instagram: ""What a shock getting this news here on the other side of the world."" ""May the Red-and-Black nation have strength and faith to get through this moment,"" the former Brazil midfielder wrote.
Flamengo made no official statement other than to tweet that it was in mourning. 
But teams from around the world, including Rio rivals Botafogo, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama, tweeted their solidarity and offered help that included psychologists and social workers.

Officials postponed Saturday's two semifinals of the Guanabara Cup, one of which was between Flamengo and Fluminense at the famous Maracana stadium, host of the 2014 World Cup final.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's decision to withdraw its ambassador to Italy may be the biggest diplomatic fracas between the neighbors since Benito Mussolini declared war on France in 1940, but the trans-Alpine stand-off has its roots in more recent events.
On Aug. 28 last year in Milan, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met to discuss strategy ahead of this May's European Parliament elections, promising to pursue an anti-immigration agenda.
""Macron is the leader of the pro-migration parties in Europe today,"" Orban, a constant thorn in the European Union's side on immigration, declared after their talks. ""And here we are, the ones who want to stop illegal immigration.""
It was a provocation that the young French president, then barely a year into office on an avowedly pro-EU platform, could not ignore. He was on a tour of Nordic states at the time, and responded at a news conference the next day.
""It is clear that a strong opposition is building up between nationalists and progressives, and I will yield nothing to nationalists and those who advocate hate speech,"" Macron told reporters in Copenhagen. ""So if they want to see me as their main opponent, they are right to do so.""
While there had been moments of sniping between Macron and Salvini, the head of the far-right League party, before then, at that point the gloves were off, with the Italian and his fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, losing no opportunity to prod the French leader. 
From criticism of France for returning migrants across the border to Italy to French ""neo-colonialism"" in Africa and Macron's prospects in the European elections, the Italian duo have repeatedly goaded the 41-year-old French president.
""IT'S NOT HARMLESS""
Macron, who has a reputation for a sharp tongue himself, has mostly tried to ignore the provocations, saying during a visit to Cairo last month that Salvini and Di Maio's remarks were irrelevant and he dealt with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
But Di Maio's decision this week to visit France and meet several representatives of the ""yellow vest"" movement, which for months has waged a sometimes violent campaign against Macron and his policies, was deemed a bridge too far.
""The idea that a (deputy) prime minister of an EU country would come to France without letting France know in advance ... It's not some harmless thing,"" said a French diplomatic source. ""It's just not acceptable behavior within the EU ...
""One hopes (withdrawing the ambassador) will force some reflection among the political parties and Italian institutions. It cannot help but underline how serious the situation is.""
Officials say the ambassador will probably be sent back soon, but tensions are likely to persist.
There are still more than three months to go until the European elections, which are shaping up to be the most divisive since they were first held in 1979. Far-right and populist parties are expected to win up to a third of the seats. 
According to Prime Minister Conte, Salvini, 45, and Di Maio, 32, both want to prop up their electoral bases. 
Conte told Chancellor Angela Merkel at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Salvini does that by hammering the theme of immigration and attacking France, while Di Maio, head of the anti-establishment 5-Star movement, just focuses on France. 
Macron once hoped to run pan-European lists for the European elections, a proposal that had EU leaders worried about encroachment on their turf. Now he will have to focus on shoring up his flagging support at home while trying to keep Salvini, Di Maio and their verbal provocations at arm's length.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 09:18AM ET</span>","Khashoggi fiancée seeks change in U.S. approach to killing, may visit","By Ezgi Erkoyun and Orhan Coskun
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi said on Friday she would welcome a change in Donald Trump's approach to the killing, and may visit the United States in March, having previously rejected an invitation from the president.
Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a team of Saudi operatives on Oct. 2, provoking international revulsion.
Trump has resisted efforts in the U.S. Congress to rebuke the Saudis, pointing to weapons sales as an important source of U.S. jobs. His administration is also reluctant to disturb the strategic relationship with the kingdom, seen as an important regional counterbalance to Iran, arch-rival of U.S. ally Israel.
""I might visit America in March,"" Khashoggi's fiancée Hatice Cengiz told a news conference to mark the release of her book on Khashoggi. ""I would welcome it if he (Trump) has a new approach on following this issue closely, or new actions to take."" 
Trump previously invited Cengiz to the United States but she said she had rejected the invitation as she thought it was aimed at influencing public opinion in his own favor.
Earlier on Friday, an aide to President Tayyip Erdogan said Saudi officials' ""complete lack of transparency"" on the murder investigation is deeply concerning and detrimental to their credibility. 
""Over the past four months, the Saudi authorities have been less than forthcoming in their dealings with their Turkish counterparts and the international community,"" said Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan's communications director.
""Saudi authorities must extradite Mr. Khashoggi's killers to Turkey, where they committed a premeditated murder, as proof of their willingness to serve the cause of justice,"" he said in a written statement to Reuters.
After making numerous contradictory statements about Khashoggi's fate, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
U.S. LAWMAKERS SEEK PENALTIES
Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers renewed their push on Thursday to penalize Saudi Arabia for the murder ahead of Friday's deadline for Trump's administration to submit a report on whether the crown prince ordered the killing.
""The Congress is renewed, the members are changed. I am hopeful. There is still hope. I believe the new Congress would follow this issue closer,"" Cengiz said. Democrats now control the U.S. House of Representatives.
Cengiz, a Turkish researcher, had waited outside the Istanbul consulate for hours on the day Khashoggi was killed and alerted the authorities and media when he did not leave.
Saudi Arabia has previously denied Turkey's extradition request for the 11 suspects, five of whom are facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia.
Erdogan has said Khashoggi's killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership. Riyadh has rejected accusations that the crown prince was involved.
On Thursday, a United Nations-led inquiry into the murder said evidence pointed to a brutal crime ""planned and perpetrated"" by Saudi officials, adding that Saudi officials had ""seriously undermined"" and delayed Turkey's investigation.
""I wish this report will accelerate the process so that more concrete things will be done on this situation,"" Cengiz said. ""I believe the U.N. report would have an international impact. 
Altun said Turkey's findings on the case were in line with those of the U.N.-led inquiry, adding that Ankara was committed to cooperating in a potential U.N. investigation into the case.
Despite Turkey's joint investigation with Saudi officials looking at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, the consul's residence and several other locations, the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains are still unknown.
Khashoggi's killing has severely strained ties between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, although Erdogan has good ties with the Saudi monarch, King Salman.

In an interview with Turkey's state broadcaster on Sunday, Erdogan said both the crown prince and Saudi's Adel al-Jubeir had lied about the case and pressure from Turkey had led to Jubeir being removed from his post as foreign minister in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Americans want tougher gun laws but have little confidence their lawmakers will take action, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday ahead of the one-year anniversary of the country's deadliest high school shooting.
The poll of more than 6,800 adults reflects widespread frustration with state and federal lawmakers after decades of mass shootings in the United States. The Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 students and staff.
According to the poll, 69 percent of Americans, including 85 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, want strong or moderate restrictions placed on firearms. To stop gun violence, 55 percent said they wanted policies that make it tougher to own guns, while 10 percent said making firearm ownership easier would be better.
The poll shows public support for strong firearms restrictions dipped slightly from a year ago, when the media was closely following the Parkland shooting, but overall support for gun restrictions has risen since the poll started asking about gun control in 2012. 
Among those who want tougher gun laws now, only 14 percent said they were “very confident” their representatives understood their views on firearms, and just 8 percent felt “very confident” their elected representatives would do anything about it.
Taletha Whitley, 41, of Clayton, North Carolina, said lawmakers were too dependent on campaign contributions from gun rights groups to care about public opinion. 
“It would take money out of their pockets” to write gun control laws, said Whitley, a Democrat who works in customer service for a local grocery chain. “That’s why they haven’t done anything about all of these mass shootings. It’s about the dollars.”
(For a graphic on the poll, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2tbgwT1)
The findings underscore the challenges for gun safety advocates who, even after a banner legislative and electoral year in 2018, continue to push against the perception that the gun lobby commands the debate.
Gun control laws have been passed in 20 states since the Parkland shooting, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Gun control advocates also outspent the National Rifle Association during last year's congressional elections, and 150 of the 196 candidates Everytown endorsed won their races for state and federal offices. 
Shannon Watts, who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America after the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, said it has taken years to build a community of activists capable of taking on the NRA. After an effort to overhaul gun laws failed in 2013, Watts continued to recruit volunteers and aligned her organization with Everytown to build a network that now has a chapter in every state. 
“You cannot underestimate the significance of hundreds of thousands of volunteers telling their lawmaker you have to do the right thing,” Watts said. “We tell them that when you do we’ll have your back, and when you don’t we'll have your job.”
Watts and others are taking advantage of a drop in activity among gun rights advocates, who have been operating with less urgency now that they have an ally in the White House.
The NRA concedes that fundraising has fallen since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in November 2016 but said gun control groups were overplaying their hand with some of their agenda. 
“There's less to do because we've been so successful over the years,"" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said. “We continue to defeat gun control legislation across the country while passing gun rights legislation.”
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL
The poll found rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans largely agree on a variety of gun-control measures, including a ban on internet sales of ammunition, stopping people with a history of mental illness from buying guns, placing armed guards at schools and expanding background checks at gun shows.
Among parents with school-age children, 65 percent said they were somewhat or very worried about gun violence in schools, and a majority of those parents were supportive of efforts intended to beef up school security. 
Sixty-one percent of parents said they favored publicly funding firearms training for teachers and school personnel, and 54 percent said they approved of allowing school personnel to carry guns. 
Irfan Rydhan, 44, of San Jose, California, favors strong firearms restrictions but said he did not seriously think about gun control until earlier this year when he enrolled his 6-year-old in kindergarten. 
“Obviously there’s a lot of anxiety that comes with dropping your kid off at public school, and there’s no one really watching him all the time,” said Rydhan, a poll respondent. “It makes you want to be more proactive about his safety.”

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English between Jan. 11 and Jan. 28 throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 6,813 adults, including 2,701 who identified as Democrats and 2,359 who identified as Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

""The agreement protects the rights of EEA EFTA citizens living in the UK and British citizens living in the EEA EFTA states, providing certainty that they can continue to do so in the event of a no-deal Brexit,"" the Icelandic government said in a statement.

Colombia has borne the brunt of the exodus of Venezuelans fleeing malnutrition and political turmoil in their once-prosperous nation, with about 800,000 flooding over the border and settling in Colombia. 
""It doesn't make sense that while (they) migrate by hunger and necessity, supporters of the dictatorship enjoy these benefits and enter our country, using this card, to shop, among other things,"" Christian Kruger, the head of the migration agency, said in a statement.
Trucks carrying humanitarian aid for Venezuela arrived in the Colombian border city of Cucuta on Thursday even as Maduro refused them entry, blocking the Tienditas bridge amid an escalating political crisis.
The arrival of the aid convoy, which includes supplies provided by the United States, has increased the pressure on Maduro after Washington as well as nations from across Latin America and Europe recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful interim ruler of Venezuela.
Maduro has rejected the aid convoy as a ""political show"" and vowed to remain in office.
Kruger said that among those barred from using their entry cards are former Tachira Governor Vielma Mora, Zulia Governor Erika Farias and Caracas Mayor Sandra Oblitas. 

Estimates of how many Venezuelans have left their home country during the tenures of former President Hugo Chavez and current leader Maduro vary widely, with some opponents and academics putting the figure at 4 million.

Just over 40 percent of those polled view China as a better partner for Germany than the United States, the survey of around 5,000 people, conducted by Atlantik-Bruecke and the Civey institute in poll in November and December, showed.
Ties between the United States and Germany, Europe's largest economy, have been strained since the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has criticized Germany repeatedly for its trade practices, defense spending and its participation in the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Germany has sought to maintain friendly ties with the United States, but senior leaders speak publicly about an erosion of trust after Washington's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, and most recently, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).
Michael Werz, senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for American Progress and a member of the executive board of the Atlantik-Bruecke, urged Germans not to let concerns about Trump spiral into anti-American resentment.
Burkhard Schwenker, deputy chairman of the Atlantik-Bruecke, said the poll showed the need to redouble efforts to expand dialogue between the two allies at all levels.
A total of 57.6 percent of those polled want to see more distance between Berlin and Washington, and 42.3 percent consider China a better partner.

About a third of those polled said they viewed right-wing populism and protectionism as the most dangerous global crises, compared to only 1.9 percent worried about Russia, and 2.2 percent who feared the growing influence of China.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 08:12AM ET</span>",Ebadi urges world action to weaken Iran rulers on revolution anniversary,"By Luke Baker and Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi said she first had doubts about the 1979 Islamic Revolution when members of the Shah's regime were executed on the rooftop of a school housing its leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
She has emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of Iran's clerical leadership, 40 years after Khomeini returned from exile in Paris on a special Air France flight to ecstatic crowds on Feb. 1, 1979.
But as Iran commemorates the rise of Khomeini, who won the support of millions opposed to the U.S.-backed Shah's lavish lifestyle and ruthless secret police, her criticisms of its current rulers are compounded by frustrations about U.S. policy.
U.S. sanctions designed to undermine Iran's ruling theocracy have only hurt ordinary Iranians who face widespread hardships, said Ebadi, a human rights lawyer and former judge who has been living in exile in Britain since 2009.
""The economic sanctions are not to the benefit of the people. They make the people poor,"" she told Reuters. 
""However, those who are close to the regime benefit from economic sanctions because it gives them the opportunity to gain dirty money. So it's good for them.""
Iranian officials were not immediately available for comment. The Islamic Republic has said it is increasing efforts against corruption, and the hardline judiciary has tried and executed several traders in recent years, accusing them of ""disrupting and corrupting the economy"" under the sanctions. 
Iran's defiance in facing U.S. sanctions and pressure is likely to be a top theme at the revolution's 40th anniversary celebrations culminating next Monday in a nationwide rally.
But Ebadi's memory of those days diverges from the official version. She recalled the chaos of the early days of the revolution, which Iranians hoped would deliver greater freedoms and prosperity after decades of dictatorship. 
""Unfortunately, it started a day after the revolution, when in a five minute court session they sentenced to death the heads of previous regime,"" said Ebadi, recalling her early doubts.
""And (they) executed all of them on the rooftop of the school in which Khomeini was residing.""
There was more disenchantment for Ebadi when tens of thousands of women took to the streets in 1979 to celebrate International Women's Day. Supporters of Khomeini, who had said women should wear the hijab in governmental offices, attacked women who were uncovered with sticks and batons.
Four decades later, signs of instability have re-emerged, albeit not on the scale of 1979.
CALLS FOR MORE PRESSURE FROM WEST
Last year, Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards and corruption in over 80 cities and towns. The unrest posed the most serious challenge to its clerical leadership since a 2009 uprising over disputed presidential elections.
Some Iranians called for the fall of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in turn blamed ""enemies of the Islamic Republic"". Small, sporadic protests continue over issues such as unpaid wages, but nothing on the scale of last year.
Iranian officials say protests and criticism of the Islamic Republic are driven by external forces intent on destroying it. 
While Ebadi dislikes severe economic sanctions of the type imposed by Washington, she believes that with enough international pressure of a different kind, the West can force Iran's clerical establishment from power.
""In my view, it's very likely because at the beginning of the revolution, 90 percent of Iranian population wanted this regime,"" said Ebadi. ""And now, if you take another poll through free elections, you will see that 90 percent of people don't want the regime any more.""
To bring that about, ""the world has to do things which weaken the Iranian government,"" said Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.
She gave as an example restrictions on Iran's use of satellites, arguing this would stop its ability to broadcast propaganda television programs in non-Persian languages. 
While she has no plans to return for now, Ebadi hopes to go back to Iran one day, ""whenever the conditions are such that I as an advocate of human rights and as a lawyer can work there.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Islamic State is far from defeated, and instead is morphing into an asymmetrical warfare force after the militant group lost almost all of the territory it once controlled in Syria, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday.
Merkel's remarks at the inauguration of the Berlin headquarters of Germany's foreign intelligence agency BND contradicted statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that the Islamist group has been defeated.
""The so-called Islamic State has been luckily driven out of its territory but this unfortunately doesn't mean that Islamic State has disappeared,"" Merkel said. ""It is transforming into an asymmetrical warfare force. And this, of course, is a threat.""
The conservative chancellor said monitoring events in Syria was one of the BND's top priorities, which also include tracking cyber threats and fake news designed to influence democratic elections.
Trump said on Wednesday that he expected a formal announcement as early as next week that the coalition fighting the militants has reclaimed all of the territory it previously held. In December he tweeted that the group has been ""defeated.""
Trump wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria by the end of April, a plan that has alarmed European allies who fear Islamic State would resurface in Syria in the absence of a credible peace plan to end the country's civil war. 
""We remain a long way from peace in Syria,"" said Merkel, adored by many of the more than 550,000 Syrians who have found refuge in Germany after she decided in 2015 to open the country's borders to almost a million asylum seekers.
The BND's new headquarters will house the agency's 4,000 workers who will have to move from its current location near Munich.
The massive structure in the German capital's central Mitte district took more than 10 years to complete and cost more than 1.4 billion euros, German media reported.

The building sits on 10 hectares of land and has some 260,000 sqm of office space.

Azuz was one of the top militants in Derna, according to Libyan officials. The city has been long a hotpot for Islamist militants. Many had fled Libya to escape persecution by Muammar Gaddafi and to fight in Afghanistan, then returned home after the dictator was toppled in 2011.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The Olympic spirit is back in Sarajevo after rival Bosnian ethnic elites set aside their differences to host the largest sport event in the country since the 1984 Winter Olympics and war of the 1990s.
The Winter European Youth Olympic Festival will open in Sarajevo on Sunday and close a week later in East Sarajevo, a former Serb-run suburb that has become a separate city, in a show of cooperation between the two former foes whose border was a wartime frontline.
Achieving that cooperation was not easy. Sarajevo belongs to the Bosniak-Croat Federation and East Sarajevo belongs to the Serb Republic, which are two autonomous regions of Bosnia carved along ethnic lines during the 1992-95 war in which 100,000 died.
The two cities missed out on staging the multi-event games in 2017 due to a lack of support from Bosnia's multiple governments after winning the race to stage it in 2012.
But two young mayors were keen to promote their cities as winter sports and tourist destinations and threaded their way through the bear traps of daily politics to turn the youth winter festival into reality.
""Was it easy? No. Have we had obstructions? Yes, every day. But the final result is that the project is happening and that we have succeeded in bringing together all levels of government, the two cities and citizens around it,"" Sarajevo Mayor Abdulah Skaka, a 35-year-old Muslim Bosniak, told Reuters.
His East Sarajevo counterpart, Mayor Nenad Vukovic, 40, a Serb, said: ""We are no longer in the trenches of the 1990s, we have overcome that ... Just leave politics out and we will cooperate well on projects of joint interest in sport and tourism.""
Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik, chairman of Bosnia's three-man inter-ethnic presidency, will officially open the event at which 1,700 young athletes will compete in eight winter sports at arenas around the two cities.
The Olympics have a special place in hearts of many Sarajevans who still remember the glory of the 1984 Winter Games that were organized for the first time in a Communist country - then former Yugoslavia.
""I hope and wish that new kids experience that same feeling which I had back then,"" said Sladjan Catic, 67, who worked in a media center during the 1984 Games.
The event bills itself a gateway to Olympics, with many medalists going on to win medals at a Games. It gives top young European athletes a first taste of an Olympic-style event.
""I've always wondered how it was for our parents during the Olympics, and wished to be part of that,"" said Emina Zolota, 17, who is one among 1,000 event volunteers.

The residential building, in the Kartal district on the Asian side of the city, collapsed on Wednesday. 
Fourteen apartments were registered at the site but the top three floors of the building had been built illegally, the city's governor said this week, and a textile workshop was operating without a licence at the entrance.
More bodies were pulled from the rubble on Friday, raising the death toll to 14, Soylu told a news conference, adding that 11 others were still being sought by emergency teams. 
A 16-year old boy was rescued from under the rubble early on Friday, two days after the collapse, footage from the site showed. 

Seven nearby buildings were evacuated for security reasons on Thursday, while prosecutors in Istanbul carried out an investigation into the cause of the incident.

Ambassador Mustapha Mansouri confirmed the recall to pro-establishment news website Le360. 
The Ambassador added that Morocco and Saudi Arabia are bound by strong and longstanding ties that are currently undergoing a ""transient crisis"", Le360 reported.
There was no official confirmation from Morocco’s foreign ministry. Mansouri did not respond to a request for comment. The Saudi embassy in Rabat declined to comment.
A government official told Reuters on Thursday that the ambassador had been in Morocco for about a week, without specifying the reason. 
The recall is due to the airing by Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya of a documentary that diverged from the Moroccan position on the Western Sahara issue, the ambassador told Le360.
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have traditionally supported Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that is also claimed by the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.
The Al Arabiya documentary comes after Qatari TV channel Al Jazeera last month aired an interview with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita who expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
Morocco, a member of the Arab coalition in Yemen's war, no longer participates in military operations and did not attend the alliance's recent military maneuvers and ministerial meetings, the minister said.
Morocco ""changed the form and content of its participation in the Arab coalition after an assessment of developments on the ground"" he said.
Tension in Moroccan-Saudi relations has been silently brewing since the rise to power of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the Gulf kingdom's de facto ruler, political analysts in Morocco say.
Saudi Arabia along with the United Arab Emirates did not vote for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid after the north African kingdom took a neutral stand in a dispute between Qatar and a number of Gulf states who have severed relations with Doha.
The Saudi crown prince was not received in Morocco last year while on a North African tour. Bourita, the foreign minister, said the visit did not take place due to what he described as a time conflict.
Morocco did not voice support for Saudi Arabia in the wake of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year, an incident that damaged Riyadh's reputation internationally.

YANGON (Reuters) - Dozens of activists in eastern Myanmar face charges of unlawful assembly, an activist leader said on Friday, after police broke up the latest protest against a statue of Aung San, the nation's independence hero and father of leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Police arrested 36 people on Thursday outside the headquarters of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in the Kayah state capital of Loikaw, said Di Di, spokesman for the Karenni Youth Force Protest Camp Committee.
Another 10 people were arrested on Friday, he said.
A video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by another group, the Union of Karenni State Youth, showed police pulling away young men and women who were sitting in a circle singing a protest song.
The video could not be verified independently by Reuters.
An officer who answered the phone at Loikaw police station declined to comment, and state officials could not be contacted.
The protests began last year after the Kayah government announced plans for a gold-coloured statue of General Aung San riding a horse, which was inaugurated this month.
Members of the Karenni minority oppose the prominent monument to a leader from the country's Burman majority.
Aung San, the founder of Myanmar's armed forces, is credited with bringing the country's ethnic minorities together before his assassination in 1947. However, minorities say the goal of a fair federal system has not been achieved. 
His daughter, Suu Kyi, won elections in 2015 but shares power with the military. 
She needs to retain support in ethnic minority areas to win elections next year, and secure peace with armed groups that profess to fight for minority rights and autonomy.
A total of 54 protesters have been charged under the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law since protests against the statue began in mid-2018, said Di Di.
If convicted, the protesters face six months in jail.
Nine of the activists are also accused of defamation and incitement, charges that carry a jail term of two years, he said.
The protesters believe it is their duty to fight against a version of history that downplays Karenni autonomy in favor of the role of Aung San, Di Di said.
""We must have a right to self-determination and a right to regional autonomy. The government must guarantee these rights,"" he said.
Fortify Rights, which is monitoring the demonstrations, urged the government to end a crackdown on peaceful protesters.

""No one should spend any time in court or behind bars for exercising their human rights,"" the group's chief executive, Matthew Smith, said in a statement.

On Jan. 25, a mine operated by Vale collapsed in the town of Brumadinho in the same state, killing an estimated 300 people in Brazil's deadliest mining disaster ever.
In a separate development on Friday, inhabitants of a city close to another dam in Minas Gerais state, operated by Arcelor Mittal, were also evacuated, firefighters said but did not give details or say why the dam was at risk.
Vale said in a statement that the Brazilian mining agency ordered the evacuation at the dam at Gongo Soco after engineering consultancy Walm said a certificate guaranteeing stability conditions had not been issued for the dam.
Vale said it has intensified inspections in the area and was installing equipment to detect vibrations and bringing in international consultants to assess the situation.
As a security measure, 500 inhabitants of the city of Barão dos Cocais, where the dam is situated, were taken to a gymnasium nearby, the municipality said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Also on Friday, authorities closed a port terminal operated by Vale in Vitoria, in the southeastern state of Espirito Santo, due to pollution issues. 
The municipality of Vitoria said on Thursday that it had fined the miner 35 million reais ($9.5 million) for throwing mining residues in the sea. Vale said in a statement that it would take appropriate measures but added that recent inspections by local authorities had not detected problems. 
In the wake of the Brumadinho mining disaster, the state of Minas Gerais cancelled Vale's license to operate another dam and a mine in the state, as the company has come under intense public pressure following the accident.

On Tuesday Vale declared force majeure on some iron ore contracts after a court-ordered halt to a mine responsible for nearly 9 percent of its output following the disaster.

A U.S. official confirmed the April target to Reuters, saying the withdrawal included a pull-out from the U.S. military base at Tanf, near the Syrian border with Iraq and Jordan.
President Donald Trump announced in December he was pulling all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, saying the battle against Islamic State there was almost won.
The president's sudden decision surprised many in his own administration as well as coalition allies such as Turkey and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that fought Islamic State with U.S. military support.
Washington has been trying to reach agreement with Turkey, which considers the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia a terrorist organization, for the safety of the YPG fighters after it pulls out. It is also discussing setting up a safe zone along the border to address Turkish security concerns.
Asked about the WSJ report, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq referred Reuters to comments by Pentagon spokesman Commander Sean Robertson, who declined to discuss the pull-out timeline.
A Turkish official said the United States had not signaled to Ankara a date when the U.S. withdrawal from Syria would be completed. 

An official from the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S.-backed alliance which is spearheaded by the YPG, told Reuters: ""What we know is that so far there is no withdrawal, and the situation on the ground is unchanged. There is no discussion to set any date or time ceiling (for a withdrawal)"".

""As long as America continues its wickedness, the Iranian nation will not abandon 'Death to America',"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a gathering of Iranian Air Force officers marking the 40th anniversary of Iran's Islamic Revolution, according to his official website. 
Trump pulled out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers last year and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran, dealing a blow to the country's economy.

""I recommend that one should not trust the Europeans just as the Americans,"" Khamenei said. ""We don't say, don't have contacts with them, but it's an issue of trust.""

The European Union has stepped up criticism of Iran's ballistic missiles program while remaining committed to the 2015 nuclear deal.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>","As India election looms, politics infiltrates the world's biggest religious festival","By Krishna N. Das
PRAYAGRAJ, India (Reuters) - At the world's biggest religious festival, the Hindu Kumbh Mela in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state, the spiritual message for the faithful is deep and profound.
The political message for voters isn't far behind.
As many as 150 million people are expected to come to the festival city of Prayagraj to bathe at the confluence of three rivers considered holy in Hinduism - the Ganges, the Yamuna, and a mythological third one, the Saraswati. Hindus believe bathing in the Ganges at the time of the Kumbh, this year from Jan. 15 to March 31, absolves people of sins.
The federal and Uttar Pradesh state governments - both controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - are spending nearly $600 million on the giant event, according to the state government.
Some Hindu religious and political figures say they expect a return on their efforts, not only from the gods, but from voters when Modi battles for a second term in an election that must be held by May.
Hindu activists are also using the event to build support for a hugely controversial project to construct a Hindu temple on the site of the 16th century Babri Mosque that was destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992. That assault triggered communal riots and led to the deaths of around 2,000 people, many of them Muslim.
Shrikant Sharma, a BJP leader and cabinet minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, denied the Kumbh was being used to score political points ahead of the election, and said people wrongly accuse the party of advocating hardline Hindu causes.
""The Kumbh is a matter of faith for us,"" Sharma told Reuters, hours after bathing there. ""That's why we are working there with complete commitment.""
Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and one of its poorest, is funding two-thirds of the money to provide an ""unforgettable pilgrimage experience"". The total cost is more than three times the last Kumbh in 2013.
The BJP nearly swept Uttar Pradesh in the last election in 2014, but depressed farm prices, high unemployment and the coming together of two caste-based regional parties have hurt its prospects this year, opinion polls show. 
A big loss of seats in the state might prevent Modi and the BJP from returning for a second term in New Delhi.
""HAIL LORD RAM""
Politics was never far away at two conferences at the Kumbh last week. 
Hindu priests and religious leaders sang praises of Modi and the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, for the ""best ever"" Kumbh.
They also called for people to back the BJP to help it build the temple for Lord Ram at the Babri Mosque site in Ayodhya. 
A powerful Hindu priest, who has no association with the BJP, said from his base at the Kumbh he would lead a group of followers on Feb. 21 to start building the temple, which could violate a court order and raise religious tensions.
""We must ensure that a nationalist government committed to building a Ram temple stays in power,"" Mohan Bhagwat, head of BJP parent and Hindu-first group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), said to loud cheers of ""Jai Shree Ram!"" - ""Hail Lord Ram!""
At another event there, Bhagwat's colleague Indresh Kumar told Reuters Modi was the ""only meritorious"" prime ministerial candidate whose party deserved at least two more terms. 
Critics among Indian historians and Muslim leaders say the actions of the BJP and other Hindu activist groups are a not only a threat to harmony, but put the very nature of India as a secular democracy at stake.
They argue Muslims are increasingly being treated as second-class citizens, pointing to the BJP's plans to give citizenship to non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan but not to Muslims.
S. Irfan Habib, a New Delhi-based historian, said the Kumbh this year was the BJP's ""Hindu India"" plan to prop up the country's majority religion for political benefit.
India's population is 80 percent Hindu and 14.2 percent Muslim. Under India's constitution following its independence in 1947, all citizens are supposed to be treated equally.
""This is a blatant violation of the ethos which our constitution represents and ethos which were cultivated by our freedom fighters,"" said Habib, a specialist in modern history. 
Governments should stay away from religion, said Habib, who supported the Modi administration's decision last year to end state aid to Muslims making the annual Islamic haj pilgrimage.
""HINDUS SHOULD FEEL PROUD""
At the Kumbh, Modi and Adityanath smile down from hoarding after hoarding, trumpeting the work of their government in Uttar Pradesh. Party workers distributed publicity material to many devotees who attended various religious conferences there.
Much of the effort and spending has no overt political tone.
Uttar Pradesh authorities have set up temporary bridges, hundreds of mass kitchens, more than 120,000 portable toilets, temporary power stations and arranged thousands of free shuttle buses.
Munna, a boatman who has been ferrying devotees for two decades, said his passengers had never been more satisfied at the arrangements than this year, including the provision of free life jackets. He said all of them credited Modi and Adityanath for the cleanliness and facilities.
""They are doing so much for us pilgrims,"" said Hitu Dambar, a corn and wheat farmer from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, holding a BJP booklet he was handed at a government-backed conference attended by more than 100 Hindu, Buddhist and Jain priests under a massive tent.
""Hindus should feel proud of what they are seeing here.""
NEW NAME, HIGHER PROFILE
Adityanath, known for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, started preparing for the Kumbh soon after taking office in 2017 and gave it top priority, officials said.
Last October, Adityanath gave the city of the Kumbh the Hindu name Prayagraj, changing it from Allahabad, an Islamic name given to the place hundreds of years ago by India's then Muslim rulers.
He held a cabinet meeting at the festival site late last month, the first such meeting held outside the state capital Lucknow. 
Pictures on social media after the cabinet meeting showed him and ministerial colleagues bare-chested, bathing in the holy waters and flanked by Hindu priests in saffron.
Modi went to Prayagraj in December to inaugurate various Kumbh-related projects. It's not yet certain if he will visit the Kumbh, said the festival's officer-in-charge Vijay Kiran Anand.
Romila Thapar, 87, one of India's best known historians, said a ""showy"" Kumbh like this year's might help invoke Hindu pride.
""I think it does make a difference to those who feel that these rituals uphold the grandeur of Hinduism, and so they take pride in that,"" Thapar told Reuters. ""They see that the state is putting in so much money, and they justify it by arguing that 'we are the rightful citizens and the state should put money into our events'.""

Huang Xiangmo is unable to return to Australia after the government rejected his application for citizenship and revoked his visa while he was overseas, newspaper reports said this week.
Australian media, citing unidentified sources, said Huang was denied residency after intelligence agencies concluded he could undertake ""acts of foreign interference"" and that he was unfit for residency.
Huang rejected that assessment and criticized Australia in his first public comments since the visa cancellation was revealed.
""It is profoundly disappointing to be treated in such a grotesquely unfair manner. The decision to cancel my visa was based on unfounded speculations that are prejudiced and groundless,"" Huang told the Australian Financial Review.
""There are many Australian companies in China, aren't they more likely to be susceptible to potential manipulation by the Chinese government?"" he said.
Representatives for Australia's Department of Home Affairs and a spokeswoman for Minister for Immigration David Coleman did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Huang's expulsion comes as Australia and China seek to repair ties that have been strained since 2017, when Canberra accused Beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs. China denies the accusation.
Huang emerged as one of Australia's biggest political donors soon after he began living in Australia. He rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was forced to resign in 2017, when allegations emerged that he was linked to Chinese-aligned interests.
The lawmaker, Sam Dastyari, sought to encourage a senior politician not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing's rule in Hong Kong in 2015.
Dastyari was also recorded warning Huang that his phone may be tapped.

Huang stopped political donations after that incident but later expanded his business interests in Australia. He paid nearly A$1 billion ($715 million) in 2018 for two Australian projects owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group.

The women's claims have threatened the reputation of the two-time president, who is one of Latin America's most respected statesmen and won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his role in negotiating an end to civil wars in the region. 
Anti-nuclear activist Alexandra Arce was the first woman to come forward in what has quickly become one of the most prominent examples of the #MeToo movement in Latin America, where activism has been more focused so far on ending violence against women and femicide. 
Arias has denied Arce's allegations through his lawyer. On Thursday, the lawyer, Erick Ramos, told Reuters that Arias declined to comment on the subsequent allegations.
Arce's decision inspired more women to speak out, including Emma Daly, communications director for international rights group Human Rights Watch. Daly said she was working as a journalist in Central America in 1990 when Arias approached her and a group of fellow reporters in a hotel lobby in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. She called out a question to him.
""He stopped, looked at me, and instead of answering my question, just reached forward with his hand, touched my chest and then pulled his hand down between my breasts and said 'You're not wearing a bra,' or words to that effect, and then moved on,"" Daly told Reuters on Thursday. ""I was left completely stunned, and the only thing I could say was, 'Yes I am.'"" 
At the time, Daly was freelancing for Reuters and the Tico Times, a Costa Rican newspaper, she said. 
""The fact that he has an incredibly impressive professional resume does not give him license to treat other people in this way,"" she said.
The Washington Post reported this week that Daly had told her then-boyfriend about the incident at the time, and told her husband about it when they met in the mid-1990s.
Eleonora Antillon, who worked as a press aide to Arias on his 1986 presidential campaign, said the politician put her hand on his erect penis, pushing her against a wardrobe and kissing her when she resisted. 
""When I saw how lawyers and some women were doubting (Arce), I decided to support her, and I said, 'I believe her because he did something similar to me years ago,'"" Antillon told Reuters in an interview. Her story was first reported by Costa Rican media. 
Marta Araya Marroni, who works in publishing, told the Tico Times that Arias grabbed her leg during a meeting in his home office in 2012 and offered her massages during subsequent phone conversations. 
Monica Morales, a journalist for Costa Rican magazine Perfil, wrote in the publication that Arias invited her to sit on top of his leg at the end of a 2013 interview. 
Arce, Araya Marroni and Morales did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story. 
Ramos, Arias' lawyer, said the Costa Rican prosecutor's office told him that only one case had been reported. The prosecutor's office confirmed that one complaint against Arias had been received.

""We are respectful of the statements of these people in the media and on social networks,"" Ramos said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday stopped a Louisiana law imposing strict regulations on abortion clinics from going into effect in its first major test on abortion since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy last summer. 
The court on a 5-4 vote granted an emergency application by Shreveport-based abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women to block the Republican-backed law from going into effect while litigation continues. 
The four liberal justices were joined by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority, suggesting that Roberts, as Kennedy used to be, is now the key vote on the issue. 
Kennedy backed abortion rights in two key cases. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who President Donald Trump appointed to replace Kennedy, joined the court's four other conservatives in dissent.
Hope Medical Group challenged the law's requirement that doctors who perform abortions must have an arrangement called ""admitting privileges"" at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic.
Kavanaugh, writing for himself, said it was not clear whether doctors would be unable to obtain the admitting privileges were the law to go into effect. He said that he would have favored allowing them to bring a later legal challenge if their efforts were unsuccessful. 
The Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group that represents the challengers, said the law could lead to the closure of two of the three abortion clinics operating in Louisiana, a state of more than 4.6 million people.
The law was passed in 2014 but courts had prevented it from going into effect. The Supreme Court itself blocked the law in 2016, two days after hearing another major case involving a similar Texas law that the justices struck down months later.
Kennedy, a conservative who retired in July 2018, had voted to preserve abortion rights in 1992 and again in the 2016 Texas case.
Roberts was a dissenter in the 2016 case, but his vote on Thursday for now suggests the court is not retreating from that precedent. 
Kavanaugh is one of two Trump appointees who are part of the court's 5-4 conservative majority, along with Neil Gorsuch.
The Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.

The court on Feb. 1 temporarily blocked the Lousiana law, which was due to go into effect on Feb. 4, while the justices decided how to proceed.

During the campaign, Bukele, who emerged victorious at the polls as an outsider candidate on Sunday, was critical of the benefits that El Salvador received after establishing diplomatic relations with China. 
Federico Anliker, a close member of the Bukele team and secretary general of his New Ideas party, said the incoming administration would investigate why the outgoing government forged ties with China.
""With the issue of China, China-Taiwan relations, we have to study them and put them in the balance - what is best for the nation, not what is best for a political party, as the (outgoing administration) did,"" Anliker told local media on Thursday
""We were not consulted, nor did they give us the reasons (for establishing) relations with China. Now we have to investigate in detail,"" he continued.
In August, El Salvador broke ties with Taiwan to establish relations with China, following the Dominican Republic and Panama. China later offered El Salvador about $150 million for social projects and 3,000 tons of rice to feed thousands of Salvadorans struck by a drought. 
The White House warned in August that China was luring countries with incentives that ""facilitate economic dependence and domination, not partnership.""
Anliker also said that Bukele, a 37-year-old former mayor of the capital, expressed his support for Juan Guaido, who proclaimed himself Venezuela's legitimate head of state in January. 

Bukele ""would not be willing to support a totalitarian government that represses its people and disrespects human rights,"" he said, referring to the administration of President Nicolas Maduro.

(Reuters) - When Sherrie Nixon saw the six strands of razor wire strung along the U.S.-Mexico border fence in her Arizona city, she said she wanted to cry.
""They're turning our town into a military base. It's like the front lines of some kind of war zone,"" Nixon, 68, told the Nogales City Council on Wednesday night. ""Please take a stand and at least have them get rid of the razor wire. It's a public nuisance, it's lethal."" 
Minutes later, the council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the use of the concertina wire as an indiscriminate use of lethal force normally reserved for battlefields and high-security prisons.
The council called on the federal government to remove the wire and not use military force or military-type tactics in their city. Nogales, a city of more than 20,000 residents, borders on the Mexican city of the same name.
""We're not going to allow this in Nogales,"" Mayor Arturo Garino, a Democrat, said at the meeting, which was recorded and streamed on the internet. ""We have children who live right next to it, 10 feet away from it.""
Garino said his city was very safe, and he did not want the eyesore and safety hazard of the wire to ruin the community's healthy economy. He planned to file a lawsuit over it.
The razor wire was installed by some of the more than 6,500 active-duty and National Guard troops deployed to the southern border. 
President Donald Trump has said troops are needed because the border is in a ""lawless state"" and faces the ""tremendous onslaught"" of Central American migrant caravans.
'CONCERTINA POSTER CITY'
""Is Nogales being used as their concertina poster city?"" the mayor asked at the meeting.
The U.S. military has put up over 70 miles (113 km) of the wire along the 2,000-mile (3,219-km) border and will add an extra 160 miles (258 km), a Defense Department spokesman said.
The U.S. Border Patrol asked for up to eight strands of wire in its Tucson sector for ""high risk urban areas commonly exploited by criminal smuggling organizations,"" Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement.
Adding extra strands of wire has stopped people climbing over the wall, the agency said. 
""Currently, there are no plans to remove the concertina wire,"" the statement said.
Nogales residents like Victor Fontes are unlikely to give up their struggle to have it removed. His two aunts, in their 90s, live near the wall and told him to tell the council what they thought of the wire.
""In Spanish, they use the word ""asquerosidad (filth),"" said Fontes, 75.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>",Saudi crown prince had threatened to use 'bullet' on Khashoggi: NYTimes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year before Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told an aide he would use ""a bullet"" on the journalist if he did not return home and end his criticism of the government, the New York Times reported on Thursday.
The crown prince's comments to a top aide in 2017 were made well before Khashoggi was killed last October in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Times reported, citing current and former U.S. and foreign officials knowledgeable about intelligence reports.
The comments were intercepted by American intelligence agencies, the newspaper reported.
U.S. intelligence analysts have interpreted the ""bullet"" comment metaphorically, meaning the crown prince did not necessarily mean to have Khashoggi shot, but they do think it showed his intent to have the journalist killed if he did not return to the kingdom, the Times said.
Riyadh, which initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance before offering contradictory explanations, has steadfastly insisted the prince was not involved in the killing. 
Representatives for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the CIA
and the National Security Agency did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the Times story.
U.S. intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and one-time royal insider, whose body was dismembered. 
The New York Times report was published one day before a congressional deadline for the White House to submit a report on whether the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing and if it intends to impose sanctions on the de facto ruler.
The United States has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials for their role in the journalist's death, but U.S. President Donald Trump has said he stands by the crown prince.
The United Nations' human rights investigator looking into Khashoggi's murder is on a week-long visit to Turkey and is scheduled to meet Istanbul's chief prosecutor on Thursday.
A U.N.-led inquiry into the Khashoggi killing said on Thursday that evidence pointed to a brutal crime ""planned and perpetrated"" by Saudi officials.

(Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is focused on a meeting at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign between Donald Trump's then campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a business associate prosecutors say has ties to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing on Thursday.
The Aug. 2, 2016 meeting between Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik was one of several at which the two discussed a topic related to Ukraine, according to the transcript of a sealed Feb. 4 court hearing in Manafort's criminal case in Washington.
Mueller contends that Manafort lied about the number of times he and Kilimnik discussed the topic, the description of which is mostly redacted in the transcript.
Judging by previous court filings the topic at issue appears to be a ""Ukrainian peace plan"" that was reportedly aimed at lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia - long an important objective of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government.
Andrew Weissmann, one of the prosecutors on Mueller's team, told the judge that Manafort's alleged lies about his meetings with Kilimnik were significant because they related to ""what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is.""
""This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating,"" Weissmann said, according to the court transcript.
Mueller is investigating U.S. allegations that Russia meddled in the election and whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow officials. So far, the investigation has ensnared 34 people. Moscow denies interference and Trump dismisses the probe as a political witch hunt.
Kilimnik, who was indicted last year on charges of witness tampering in Manafort's case, has denied having ties to Russian spy agencies.
In addition to the Aug. 2, 2016 meeting, which took place at the Grand Havana Club, a cigar bar in Manhattan, Manafort and Kilimnik also discussed the Ukraine-related issue in December 2016 and twice in early 2017, according to the transcript.
One of the discussions took place in person in January 2017 when Kilimnik was in Washington for Trump's inauguration, the filing said.
The closed hearing was held so the judge could weigh evidence supporting allegations by Mueller's office that Manafort had lied to prosecutors about five subject matters in breach of a plea agreement struck in September.
Manafort, who was convicted of financial crimes by a jury in a separate case in Virginia in August, has said any inconsistencies in his statements to prosecutors and the grand jury were not intentional.

The transcript also showed that Manafort continued to work for a client in Ukraine in 2018 even after he was indicted by Mueller.

CUCUTA, Colombia/TIENDITAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Trucks carrying humanitarian aid for crisis-stricken Venezuela arrived in the Colombian border city of Cucuta on Thursday as diplomatically-isolated President Nicolas Maduro appeared set to block its entry amid an escalating political crisis.
The arrival of the aid convoy, which includes supplies provided by the United States, has increased the pressure on Maduro hours after a European Union-backed group called for dialogue and elections and warned against interventionism.
Maduro has rejected the aid convoy as a ""political show"" and vowed to remain in office despite dozens of nations around the world disavowing his leadership and recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's rightful head of state.
Escorted by police motorcycles, the trucks pulled into Cucuta, where Venezuelans were waiting to see whether Maduro's government would clear the border road he has blocked and allow the humanitarian shipments to pass.
The crowd waved signs denouncing Maduro as a ""cancer"" and celebrated the arrival of the convoy.
""This gives me such hope, especially for the family that I left behind, my children, my wife,"" said Israel Escobar, 42, a Venezuelan who came to Cucuta a year ago to sell ice-cream on the streets. ""This is one more step towards ending that terrible regime.""
Across the border on the Venezuelan side, a group of around 60 protesters demanded that the aid be let through. 
Maduro has overseen an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat and fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region.
An estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC country since 2015, some 800,000 of whom have ended up in Colombia. 
But Maduro showed little sign of relenting on aid, as a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela remained blocked with a cistern and two shipping containers.
""The so-called 'humanitarian aid' operation is a show, a cheap show, a bad show,"" Maduro said in interview with Mexican newspaper La Jornada published on Thursday. ""You can be sure that it won't disturb Venezuela.""
On Thursday, he appeared in an event at the presidential palace as part of a campaign by government supporters demanding an end to U.S. aggression against Venezuela.
Elliott Abrams, Washington's special envoy on Venezuela, said the aid effort was being coordinated with Guaido's team but that the aid would not be forced into Venezuela. 
""Let it in, that's what we're asking, let it in,"" Abrams told reporters at a State Department briefing, calling on members of Venezuela's armed forces to persuade Maduro to step down or to disobey his orders.
He said the supplies would be delivered to Venezuelans when it was ""logistically safe"" to do so. 
DIALOGUE AND ELECTIONS
Washington last week implemented crippling sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which are expected to exacerbate the hyperinflationary economic crisis.
Offering a counter-point to Washington's hard-line stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that have kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections. 
The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis.
EU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini said a resolution ultimately must come from the people of Venezuela.
""This is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,"" Mogherini said.
Maduro via Twitter welcomed the call for dialogue. 
Critics have said three previous dialogue processes have allowed the ruling Socialist Party to stall for time without making major concessions on key issues including imprisoned opposition politicians and electoral transparency.
Guaido has galvanized the opposition since taking over as head of Venezuela's National Assembly in January. Last month, he declared himself interim president, opening the door for Washington and others to recognize him as the legitimate leader.
Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, has maintained power with the backing of Venezuela's military.
One Venezuelan Air Force general and several Venezuelan diplomats abroad have turned on Maduro and recognized Guaido. 
The websites of Venezuelan embassies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico on Thursday posted statements recognizing Guaido, which the embassies quickly dismissed as the work of hackers, reiterating ""absolute support"" for Maduro.

The International Monetary Fund, which a new government in Caracas would likely call on for financial assistance, is awaiting guidance from its member countries on whether to recognize Guaido, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday.

Paul Whelan, who also holds British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained by Russia's Federal Security Service on Dec. 28 and accused of espionage. Whelan denies the charges and his family has said he was in Moscow to attend a wedding.
U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said the United States has had two consular visits with Whelan, most recently on Feb. 2. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman saw Whelan a month earlier.
Palladino said U.S. consular officials had been scheduled by the Russian foreign affairs ministry to see Whelan on Jan. 17. 
""On the morning of January 17, we learned that the visit would be rescheduled at the investigator's request,"" Palladino told reporters. ""We take seriously our right to visit detained American citizens regularly.""
""We've expressed our concern through diplomatic channels and we call on Russia to meet its obligation under both the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the bilateral consular agreement between our two countries to provide consular access to Mr. Whelan,"" he added. 
Whelan appeared in a Moscow court on Jan. 22, where a judge denied him bail. If found guilty of espionage, he could be imprisoned for up to 20 years. 
He was detained after receiving a thumb drive containing a list of all the employees of a secret Russian state agency, Russian online news portal Rosbalt.ru reported last month.

Vladimir Zherebenkov, Whelan's lawyer, said his client had been misled before his arrest and believed that a thumb drive handed to him in a hotel room had contained holiday snaps rather than secret information.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Accused Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman appeared cheerful as the jury in his U.S. trial ended its first week of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a verdict, grinning broadly as he hugged and bumped fists with his lawyers.
U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan dismissed the 12 weary-looking jurors from federal court in Brooklyn at about 4:15 p.m. They will resume deliberating on Monday morning.
Guzman, 61, is accused of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. He twice escaped from prison in Mexico. If convicted in the United States, he could face life in prison.
The defense has argued Guzman was set up as a ""fall guy"" by Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a Sinaloan drug kingpin who remains at large. Despite Guzman's upbeat demeanor on Thursday, there has been no sign of what way the jury will decide.
Earlier in the afternoon, the jury sent a note asking to review the testimony of one a key prosecution witness, Juan Carlos ""Chupeta"" Ramirez, concerning a series of alleged cocaine shipments codenamed ""Juanitas."" 
Ramirez, who has pleaded guilty to U.S. charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, testified that he sold Guzman tons of cocaine for export to the United States.
Cogan told the jurors that a transcript of the testimony would be ready for them by Monday.
Ramirez was one of more than 50 witnesses who testified during the 11-week trial, which offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named for the state in northwestern Mexico where Guzman was born. [nL1N1ZO266]
Since they began deliberating Monday afternoon, the jurors have asked to review days of testimony from several witnesses, mostly from former associates of Guzman who agreed to testify against him after striking deals to cooperate with U.S. authorities.

The jurors must decide deliver a verdict on 10 criminal counts, one of which consists of 27 criminal violations. The charges include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, international drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Blackface scandals highlight U.S.'s troubled racial past - and present,"(Advisory: Note language in paragraph 11)
By Andrew Hay
(Reuters) - The painful history of blackface in America was highlighted this week as two top Virginia Democrats came under fire after admitting to having blackened their faces to resemble African-Americans while in college in the 1980s.
White Americans have been blackening their faces to mimic blacks for two centuries. While the practice is less common than it was decades ago, African-American scholars say it persists in some corners as evidence of racism.
Apologies by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring followed blackface appearances by celebrities such as actor Billy Crystal and late-night talk show host Jimmy Fallon in recent years.
WHEN DID BLACKFACE BEGIN IN THE U.S.?
Blackface began in New York vaudeville shows of the 1830s, when slavery was still legal in the U.S. South, and featured white performers who blackened their faces with burnt cork or shoe polish to caricature blacks on plantations as lazy and stupid.
With ugly, exaggerated features, and wearing tattered clothes, these ""minstrels"" made fun of enslaved Africans as superstitious, hypersexual and cowardly, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. 
""It supported the idea of slavery,"" said Wornie Reed, director of the Race and Social Policy Center at Virginia Tech. ""If these people are like that, then of course they should be in slavery and taken care of.""
WHY DID BLACKFACE BECOME SO POPULAR?
An American minstrel sub-industry of songs, sheet music, makeup, costumes and toys flourished through the mid-19th century even as the Northern and Southern (NYSE:SO) states fought the Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865. Songs that defamed African-Americans became popular in the 1880s and 1890s.
By the early 20th century, black entertainers used blackface to gain acceptance with white audiences. White actors wearing blackface acted like buffoons in one of the first American epic movies, 1915's ""Birth of a Nation."" Popular American actors, including Shirley Temple, Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, donned blackface. 
""From the very beginning, putting on a blackface has been to act like either a foolish negro or a dangerous nigger,"" said David Pilgrim, who is African-American and a former sociology professor who founded the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University in Big Rapid, Michigan.
The name of the minstrel genre's most famous character, ""Jim Crow,"" applied to laws adopted by U.S. states that segregated blacks and whites and remained on the books through the mid-20th century.
WHY DIDN'T BLACKFACE DIE OUT?
Professional blackface performances petered out in the United States in the latter 20th century, though it remained a feature of some variety shows and movies, notably the 1986 film ""Soul Man.""
Pilgrim said the practice lingers on in what he called ""safe white spaces"" like college campus sororities and fraternities where there is no one to challenge it.
African-American scholars, including Reed, said the continued appearance of blackface points to racism in U.S. culture.
""White supremacy still reigns, and the person who does blackface may not subscribe to all the tenets of it, but they are operating under that general idea,"" said Reed.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR U.S. POLITICS?
Both Democrats and Republicans condemned the images emerging in Virginia this week, but the scandal was an unwelcome blow to Democratic Party leaders in a swing state that will play a key role in the 2020 White House race and where the Democrats have been gaining ground, helped by growing strength with women and minorities.

Republican President Donald Trump on Twitter said he believed the scandal would boost his party's chances in 2020.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Principles or power? Virginia political scandal a test for Democrats,"By John Whitesides
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The spiraling political crisis in Virginia, which threatens to take out three top state Democrats with racial scandals or sexual assault accusations, poses a stiff test for a party thriving on its growing strength with women and minorities.
If all three step aside, the next in line to be governor is the Republican House speaker. That leaves many state Democrats in a quandary: Should they stick to the moral high ground and seek their resignations, or protect the party's power in a vital battleground state?
""This is a moment of reckoning for Virginia,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at Mary Washington University in Virginia. ""Political principles that cost you something are always a lot harder to maintain.""
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and state Attorney General Mark Herring, who is third in line to the governor, have acknowledged wearing blackface while students in college in the 1980s, an act widely seen as racist although it was not uncommon in television and movies of the time.
Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who would take over as governor if Northam steps down, faces allegations he sexually assaulted a woman in 2004. Fairfax, who is black, has denied the allegation and said the sexual encounter was consensual.
Northam faced a wave of calls for his resignation from state Democrats and at least five Democratic 2020 White House contenders after the scandal broke last week when a racist photo from his 1984 medical school yearbook surfaced.
But as the controversy spread to Fairfax and Herring, many Democrats have softened their position amid fears the growing crisis will halt the party's recent political momentum ahead of legislative elections this year and the presidential election next year.
""This has been a complete debacle,"" said Virginia-based Democratic strategist Ben Tribbett, who said the early surge of Democratic calls for Northam's resignation were made out of confidence that a Democrat would replace him.
Now, he said, many Democrats are reconsidering.
'POLITICAL POWER'
""It has all been about political power. We don't have the principles we think we have,"" Tribbett said.
Buoyed by a backlash against Republican President Donald Trump, particularly in suburban areas, Democrats have made huge gains in Virginia in the last two years. They moved close to capturing a majority in the state House of Delegates in 2017, and picked up three U.S. House of Representatives seats from Republicans last year.
But Tribbett said Democrats in the state will have to answer questions about the scandals for years, whether or not any of the three leaves office. Herring and Fairfax had been seen as the top two Democratic contenders to replace Northam when his four-year term ends in 2021.
Women and racial minorities are two of the party's most reliable voting blocs, and national Democrats have made racial justice and sexual equality key pillars of their agenda, taking a tough line against sexual misconduct or racial insensitivity to try to avoid being accused of hypocrisy in criticizing Trump and Republicans.
The scandal in Virginia ""shows how vulnerable Democrats can become to these attacks,"" Republican strategist John Feehery said. ""When they attack each other on these themes, it hits hard.""
The Democratic approach stands in contrast to the recent strategy by Republicans, who have stuck with Trump after he brushed off allegations of sexual misconduct to win the White House and weathered repeated scandals in office.
Other Republicans have taken a cue from the president. Chris Collins of New York was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November despite facing an indictment for insider trading.
Despite a history of racist comments, Steve King is still a member of Congress even though he was kicked off committees by Republican leaders after defending white nationalism and white supremacy in an interview.
Democrats said there was little danger of the party stealing a page from Trump and trying to ride out future controversies.
""I don't think Trump has changed the game,"" said Democratic strategist Dane Strother, who frequently works on campaigns in the South, noting Democratic Senator Al Franken's 2017 resignation after allegations of unwanted sexual advances were made against him.

""Democrats have not learned the wrong lessons from Trump, and I'm glad about that. I hate that Al Franken is gone, but he did what he thought was best,"" he said. ""If you sexually harass a woman or you say racist things ... as Democrats we stop and talk about it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The choice of Vietnam as the venue for a second U.S.-North Korea summit this month shows the possibility of moving beyond conflict and division toward a thriving partnership, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday.
State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told a news briefing that U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun was in Pyongyang to prepare the Feb. 27-28 summit and seeking progress on commitments made at the first meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June.
These included complete denuclearization, transformation of U.S.-North Korea relations and building a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, he said. Palladino reiterated that sanctions relief that North Korea has been seeking would follow its denuclearization.
He said U.S.-Vietnamese history ""reflects the possibility for peace and prosperity.""
""We moved past conflict and division towards the thriving partnership we enjoy today,"" Palladino said.
He gave no other details on Biegun's talks in Pyongyang and declined to say how long he would stay there. The State Department said earlier in the week that Biegun would travel to Pyongyang for talks with his North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol on Wednesday, but has not commented further.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency earlier quoted diplomatic sources as saying that Biegun was expected to fly back to South Korea on Friday to share the outcome of his Pyongyang visit, although his stay in North Korea could be extended if additional discussions were needed.
Trump announced the plan for his second meeting Kim in his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday.
He said much work remained to be done in the push for peace with North Korea, but cited the halt in its nuclear testing and no new missile launches in 15 months as proof of progress.
Trump has been eager for a second summit despite a lack of significant moves by North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. He and Biegun have stressed the economic benefits to North Korea if it does so. 
Biegun said last week his Pyongyang talks would be aimed at mapping out ""a set of concrete deliverables"" for the second summit. He said Washington was willing to discuss ""many actions"" to improve ties and entice Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and that Trump was ready to end the 1950-53 Korean War, which concluded with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
While in the U.S. view, North Korea has yet to take concrete steps to give up its nuclear weapons, Pyongyang complains that Washington has done little to reciprocate for its freezing of nuclear and missile testing and dismantling of some facilities.
Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been keen to host the second summit as a demonstration of its normalization of ties with the United States since the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975 and killed more than 58,000 Americans and an estimated three million Vietnamese. 
The United States sustained more than 33,000 battle deaths in the Korean War, while the number of North Koreans killed, both military and civilian, has been estimated at about one million.
While Trump has hailed ""tremendous progress"" in his dealings with North Korea, a confidential report by U.N. sanctions monitors seen by Reuters this week cast further doubt on North Korea's intentions.
It said the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs remained intact and North Korea was working to make sure those capabilities could not be destroyed by any military strikes.

Palladino did not comment when asked about the report.

FREETOWN (Reuters) - The brutal rape of a young girl by her uncle in Sierra Leone became the rallying point for a campaign that on Thursday pushed President Julius Maada Bio to declare the prevalence of sexual violence a national emergency.
The five-year-old girl, whose identity has been kept secret for her own safety, has been paralyzed from the waist down since a 28-year-old male relative raped her a year ago, crushing her spine.
""She may never walk again, and I want vengeance for what has happened,"" her grandmother told Reuters, sitting next to the girl in her wheelchair in a Freetown medical clinic.
""The man who did this ruined her life and deserves to spend his life in prison.""
The assault was one of many that have gone unpunished in Sierra Leone, where until now sexually-motivated crimes carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and few cases were successfully prosecuted.
Following months of campaigning by activists, the president declared a national emergency and said those convicted of sexual offences against minors would face life in prison.
""Some of our families practise a culture of silence and indifference towards sexual violence, leaving victims even more traumatized,"" Bio told a crowd at the State House.
""We as a nation must stand up and address this scourge.""
According to police statistics, reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence nearly doubled last year to over 8,500, a third of which involved a minor. Activists, including First Lady Fatima Bio, say the actual figures are much higher as most cases are never reported.
Gender-based violence is a traditionally seen as a taboo topic in Sierra Leone. Only 12 years ago parliament passed its first gender equality laws in 46 years of independence, following lobbying efforts by women's rights groups. 
Implementation of these policies has been slow and law enforcement agencies have been hampered by inadequate resources, promoting a culture of impunity.
In December, the first lady led a demonstration in the capital to raise awareness of the issue, and has since launched her ""Hands Off Our Girls"" campaign to increase awareness of violence against girls across West Africa.
The president's declaration of a national emergency is seen as a step in the right direction, but activists such as Fatmata Sorie say progress must continue.
""We still need to think about how services for survivors are not accessible, especially for the poor,"" said Sorie, who is president of Legal Access through Women Yearning for Equality Rights and Social Justice (LAWYERS) – an all-female group of barristers who provide pro bono legal services to vulnerable women and girls. 
""We've made a big step today, but this is a very complex issue that will require complex and continuing solutions,"" she said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Talks on a U.N.-sponsored prisoner swap in Yemen's war could drag on for months if the Saudi-backed government denies the existence of thousands of Houthi fighters in captivity, the Iranian-aligned Houthis said on Thursday.
In two rounds of talks in the Jordanian capital Amman, the warring parties have been hammering out details of the prisoner exchange they agreed last December as a confidence-building gesture at the first major peace talks of the nearly four-year-old war.
The United Nations is pushing for the swap and for a peace deal in the country's main port city of Hodeidah as part of stepped up efforts to end the nearly four-year conflict that has left 15.9 million people facing severe hunger.
Delegates to the talks have been struggling to come with a final list of detainees after verifying an initial one they exchanged in Sweden that had around 15,000 people.
Abdul Qader Murtada, who heads the Houthi delegation, said the government side had accounted for only a tenth of a total of 7,500 of Houthi prisoners held in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
""If the other side remains in its intransigent position of denying the presence of our prisoners the talks will drag on for months,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the current round of talks, which began on Tuesday.
The Houthis have in turn recognized only 3,600 from an original list of 9,500 names submitted by the government side of their detainees, saying over 4,000 names were either fake, duplicate names or of prisoners who had been released, he added.
Murtada also said they had ""tens"" of captive Saudi military personnel in their jails, some of whom were high ranking and whose release would only take place if all their prisoners were released.
""The Saudis are tied to the fate of the Yemenis as a whole and we reject entering into negotiations with them except over a deal that involves all our prisoners,"" he said.
The Yemeni government's backers have not commented on the course of the prisoner swap talks.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - leaders of a Western-backed coalition battling the Houthis to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s government - want to exit a costly war that has dragged on for nearly four years. They have endorsed the U.N. push to reach a peace deal. 

The discussions over the swap, which would be conducted via the Houthi-held Sanaa airport in north Yemen and the government-held Sayun airport in the south, have also included returning remains of dead fighters from both sides.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>","Evidence shows Khashoggi murder planned, carried out by Saudi officials: U.N.","By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations-led inquiry into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi said on Thursday that evidence pointed to a brutal crime ""planned and perpetrated"" by Saudi officials.
Khashoggi's killing by a team of Saudi operatives on Oct. 2 provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive.
U.S. intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, a critic and Washington Post columnist, and say his body was dismembered and removed to a location still publicly unknown. Riyadh denies the prince had any involvement in the murder.
""Evidence collected during my mission to Turkey shows prime facie case that Mr. Khashoggi was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the State of Saudi Arabia,"" Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, said in statement issued in Geneva.
She said her Jan 28-Feb 3 mission to Turkey with a team of three experts ""could not firmly establish whether the original intention was to abduct Mr. Khashoggi, with his murder planned only in the eventuality of this abduction failing.""
Saudi officials had ""seriously undermined"" and delayed Turkey's efforts to investigate the crime scene at its Istanbul consulate, where Khashoggi had gone to get papers needed for his wedding, she said. 
Neither the Saudi government communications office nor Turkey's foreign ministry gave immediate responses to requests for comment on the report.
""CLEAN-UP OF THE CRIMES SCENES""
Delayed access to the consulate and residence and ""clean up of the crimes scenes"", had severely limited the potential for the Turkish criminal forensic investigation to ""produce telling evidence"", Callamard added.
After Khashoggi's first visit to the consulate on Sept 28, Saudi planning included ""the travel of the three teams that carried out the operation; the presence of a lookalike of Mr Khashoggi who was seen leaving the consulate; the presence of a forensic doctor; the escape of the teams' members and, of course, the disposal of Mr. Khashoggi's body.""
It was ""unconscionable"" that Saudi authorities continued to fail to disclose the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains, ""after having admitted that he met his death within their custody in their consular premises,"" she added.
Callamard said her team had access to part of ""chilling and gruesome audio material"" of Khashoggi's death obtained by the Turkish intelligence agency. She had also been promised access to forensic and police reports critical to her inquiry.
A Saudi public prosecutor’s spokesman said late last year that 11 Saudis had been indicted and referred for trial over the case, with authorities seeking the death penalty for five.
Saudi Arabia has denied Turkey's request for extradition of the 11 suspects, amid conflicting claims for jurisdiction, Callamard said. She had ""major concerns"" about the fairness of the trial proceedings and had sought an official visit to the kingdom.

Callamard is due to submits her final report in June to the U.N. Human Rights Council, including recommendations on formal criminal accountability.

Fixing the crisis at Eskom was the main talking point ahead of Ramaphosa's annual state of the nation address as it will be key to him delivering on a pledge to revive an economy that flagged under his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma.
Many investors and analysts have called for Eskom to be partially privatized, but significant sections of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and powerful trade unions have said that is a red line not to be crossed.
Trying to appease all sides ahead of a parliamentary election expected in May, Ramaphosa said Eskom's generation, transmission and distribution businesses would become separate entities under an Eskom holding company.
""Eskom is in crisis and the risks it poses to South Africa are great,"" Ramaphosa said during an address in parliament attended by hundreds of lawmakers and dignitaries, and watched by an anticipated television audience of more than 1 million.
""We need to take bold decisions and decisive action. The consequences may be painful, but they will be even more devastating if we delay,"" he added.
Eskom supplies more than 90 percent of South Africa's power and employs 48,000 people.

Successive governments have avoided addressing its inefficient monopolistic structure, fearing the backlash from socialist elements in the ANC and much of the public given the likely job losses.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child on Thursday urged Japan to do more to let children be children, free of excessive pressures or corporal punishment in school or at home.
The human rights watchdog also urged Japanese authorities to look into the root causes of rising adolescent suicide rates, now at a 30-year high.
A total of 250 children took their own lives in the year to last March, according to authorities, while overall suicide numbers are in steady decline.
""We urged (Japan) to take measures to ensure that children enjoy their childhood, without their childhood and development being harmed by the competitive nature of society,"" Kirsten Sandberg, one of a panel of 18 independent experts, told a briefing.
Japanese law prohibits corporal punishment in schools but the ban is ""not effectively implemented"", while many children also endure it at home, the U.N. panel said. 
Japan was shocked last March by the death of 5-year-old Yua Funato, who left handwritten notes seeking forgiveness from her abusive parents.
The U.N. panel said children should have access to a 24/7 helpline.
It also criticised Japan for having lowered the minimum age for criminal punishment from 16 to 14 years, and said children were often removed from families and placed in institutions without a court order for being ""likely to commit a crime"".
Masato Ohtaka, of Japan's foreign ministry, told the panel that Japanese children faced challenges such as bullying, abuse, sexual exploitation and poverty, and that Japan aimed to establish a robust social system in which all generations could enjoy peace of mind.
In July, the Japanese government promised emergency steps to boost the number of child welfare workers by 60 percent within five years.

The Committee carries out a two-day review of countries' records every five years.

An international investigation led by the Netherlands concluded that the passenger jet - en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur - was brought down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. Moscow has denied any involvement.
""We are in contact with Russia over national accountability via diplomatic channels,"" a foreign ministry spokeswoman said. ""We are increasingly confident that we will sit down with the Russians shortly.""
MH17 was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people onboard, roughly two-thirds of them Dutch.
In May 2018 the Dutch and Australian governments said they would hold Russia responsible for the plane's destruction after investigators traced the “Buk” missile system they said was used to bring it down to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, based in the western Russian city of Kursk.

Responding at the time, President Vladimir Putin said the airliner was not brought down by a Russian missile.

PARIS/ROME (Reuters) - France recalled its ambassador to Italy on Thursday, a remarkable diplomatic split between neighbors and European Union allies, after what it described as ""repeated, baseless"" attacks by Italian political leaders against France.
The rupture, the first withdrawal of a French envoy to Rome since World War Two, was announced by the foreign ministry.
Diplomats said Paris acted after a series of insults from Italy, capped by Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio's decision this week to meet with members of France's ""yellow vest"" movement, which has mounted a months-long and sometimes violent campaign against Macron. 
""France has been, for several months, the target of repeated, baseless attacks and outrageous statements,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""Having disagreements is one thing, but manipulating the relationship for electoral aims is another.""
Di Maio, head of the anti-establishment 5-Star movement, which is in a governing coalition with the far-right League, defended his meeting with the ""yellow vests"", and drew a distinction between Macron and the French people.
""The French people are our friends and our ally,"" he said. ""President Macron has repeatedly lashed out against the Italian government for political reasons in view of the European elections,"" he said, referring to a European Parliament vote in May that is expected to see a surge among populist parties.
""My meeting as the political leader of the 5-Star movement with members of the 'yellow vests'... was fully legitimate. I claim the right to talk with other political forces that represent the French people."" 
The 32-year-old Di Maio appears keen to cast himself as a youthful rival to Macron, 41, even as his approval rating falls at home. 
Macron offered no immediate response to Di Maio. 
He has spent much of the past month touring France in a ""great debate"" with citizens to try to lift his own approval ratings and regain the initiative in the face of the protests. While Thursday's diplomatic action was going on, he was attending one such townhall meeting in the small eastern town of Etang-sur-Arroux.
France's Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said the decision to recall the ambassador was rare but necessary.
""There was behavior by a member of the Italian government that we consider unusual, unfriendly and that follows a number of official Italian statements that we find hard to understand in terms of how they help Franco-Italian relations,"" she told France Info.
BASTA ITALIA! 
Ties between the two traditionally close allies have grown increasingly tense since mid-2018, with Di Maio and his fellow deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini of the League party, firing pot-shots at Macron and France, mostly over migration policy.
Macron has at times responded, criticizing Italy last June for its refusal to accept a boatload of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean, and taking aim at Rome's public finances.
But in recent weeks the exchanges have grown sharper and more personal. Di Maio accused France last month of fuelling poverty in Africa, suggesting it was a neo-colonial power.
Salvini accused France of exploiting the unrest in Libya to benefit oil company Total, which competes with Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) in the development of regional energy assets. He also said he hoped Macron's party would lose in May's European elections.
During a visit to Egypt last month, Macron sought to shrug off the sparring, calling Salvini and Di Maio's comments ""insignificant"" and adding that he dealt only with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
Conte, a political unknown who became prime minister last year as a compromise between Salvini and Di Maio, was caught on video at last month's World Economic Forum in Davos discussing the dispute with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Italian TV channel La 7 broadcast footage a week ago showing the two leaders talking at a bar, with Conte telling Merkel that Di Maio was attacking France because he was down in the polls ahead of the European elections and needed an enemy. 
""So they say what are the issues that can help us during the campaign... In the political campaign our friend is Germany and so we had to do the campaign against France,"" he said, prompting laughter from Merkel.
TIME TO 'TURN THE PAGE'?
Salvini sought to calm the tone on Thursday, saying he did not want to argue with France and was happy to meet Macron. As president, Macron would normally meet with other heads of state or government, not deputies.
""We are ready and willing, with a constructive spirit, to turn the page for the good of our people,"" Salvini said.
But he added that France should address three issues: its policy of returning migrants to Italy, occasional border checks at the frontier, and the case of some 15 Italian leftists who have had refuge in France for decades.

While rare, the French action was not unprecedented among EU members. In 2016, Greece recalled its ambassador to Austria, and in 2017 Hungary withdrew its envoy to the Netherlands.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","For Putin, economic and political reality dampen appetite for arms race","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - With his ratings down and state funds needed to hedge against new Western sanctions and raise living standards, Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to get sucked into a costly nuclear arms race with the United States.
Alleging Russian violations, Washington said this month it was suspending its obligations under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and starting the process of quitting it, untying its hands to develop new missiles.
That raises the prospect of a new arms race between Washington and Moscow, which denies flouting the treaty. Putin responded by saying Russia would mirror the U.S. moves by suspending its own obligations and quitting the pact. 
But Putin, who has sometimes used bellicose rhetoric to talk up Russia's standoff with the West and to rally Russians round the flag, did not up the ante. 
He did not announce new missile deployments, said money for new systems must come from existing budget funds and declared that Moscow would not deploy new land-based missiles in Europe or elsewhere unless Washington did so first.
""...We must not and will not let ourselves be drawn into an expensive arms race,"" Putin told Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
His statement was borne of necessity. 
Harsh economic and political realities and memories of how the cost of the Cold War arms race contributed to the Soviet Union's demise means Putin's options are limited, a situation that may curb his appetite for expensive escalation in future.
That does not mean Putin is not still spending heavily on the military. He unveiled an array of new weapons last year which he billed as world-beating, including a hypersonic missile, a laser weapon, an underwater nuclear drone and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.
But his ability to bankroll a full-on arms race is limited. 
""We need to keep in mind that the question of an arms race that could cut us into pieces is entirely realistic,"" Sergei Dubinin, former governor of Russia's central bank, told Russia's RBC TV channel before Washington announced its exit.
He said the United States was trying to repeat its successful Cold War strategy of pushing Moscow into an arms race it could not afford and that Russia would be ill-advised to try to attain parity and needed a smart response instead.
Memories of empty supermarket shelves in the run-up to the 1991 Soviet collapse still haunt many older Russians as the then Soviet Union directed huge cash flows to the military-industrial complex to try to keep up with the United States while neglecting the consumer economy. 
""They (the Americans) recall that the Soviet Union collapsed in part because it tried to keep up with the United States when it came to who produced more missiles, nuclear submarines and tanks,"" Viktor Litovkin, a military expert, told the Russian army's Zvezda TV channel.
""They are trying to do the same thing today.""
COUNTING THE COSTS
With the INF treaty suspended, Washington and Moscow have said they will develop previously prohibited short- and intermediate-range land-based missiles, with Russia saying it wants them ready by 2021. 
Shoigu told Putin the money to develop two new land-based missile launchers would come from this year's budget by reallocating existing funds.
Russia does not disclose the full extent of its military and national security spending, but says it will account for around 30 percent of its 18-trillion-ruble ($273-billion) budget this year. 
Oil revenues mean Russia is not short of money. Its budget surplus this year is projected to be 1.932 trillion rubles ($29.3 billion) or 1.8 percent of gross domestic product. Russia's foreign exchange reserves stand at $478 billion, the fifth largest in the world.
But the money is already allocated in a way dictated by Moscow's difficult geopolitical situation and by Putin's own increasingly tricky domestic political landscape. Reallocating the money would be painful. 
Moscow is hoarding cash to try to give itself a $200-billion buffer against new Western sanctions and is embarking on a multi-billion dollar spending push to try to overhaul the country's creaky infrastructure and raise living standards.
With signs of rising discontent over years of falling real incomes, rising prices, an increase in value-added tax and an unpopular plan to raise the pension age, Putin is under pressure to deliver.
Igor Nikolaev, director of auditor FBK's Strategic Analysis Institute, said Putin might have to take money from other parts of the budget to fund a new arms race which would force him to scale back social spending plans or dip into the national wealth fund to top up the budget.
If a burgeoning arms race intensified, such a scenario would become more likely and Putin would be reluctant to spend more on defense in the current political climate, he said.
""It would not be desirable, especially as we know what's happening with real incomes and that there are problems with his rating,"" said Nikolaev. ""Cutting spending on national projects would receive a mixed reaction.""
Though re-elected last year until 2024, and therefore not under immediate political pressure, Putin's trust rating has fallen to a 13-year low. A poll this month showed the number of Russians who believe their country is going in the wrong direction hit its highest level since 2006. 
Putin's symmetrical response to Washington, which involves developing new missiles, has already angered some Russians.
""Are new arms a source of joy?"" wrote blogger Vladimir Akimov, saying the money would be better spent on lifting people out of poverty. ""Why not begin by repairing the roads and knocking down the wooden shacks (that people live in) across the country.""

Zakharova singled out what she said was a Norwegian plan to this year equip a port near Tromso to be able to receive nuclear submarines.

PARIS (Reuters) - France warned its citizens in Chad on Thursday to be extra vigilant after its fighter jets struck a heavily-armed rebel convoy that crossed last week from southern Libya aiming to destabilize President Idriss Deby.
French warplanes destroyed about 20 pick-up trucks in a third day of air strikes on Wednesday after Deby asked Paris for support. France sees him as key to a wider regional fight against Islamist militants.
""Given the air operations which the French military are carrying out in northeast Chad and to prevent any malicious act against them, French nationals are urged to be more vigilant,"" the embassy said in a message to its 1,500 citizens in Chad.
The strikes, which started on Sunday, come as Chadian rebels have increased their activities in southern Libya since vowing last year to overthrow Deby.
    The Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a rebel Chadian coalition created in 2009 after almost toppling Deby, has said it was behind this week's incursion, which saw some 50 pick-up trucks drive almost unopposed more than 600 km (372.82 miles) into Chadian territory.
""Bombings are continuing today. Several dozen vehicles have been destroyed and there are many seriously wounded,"" a senior UFR official told Reuters, declining to say how many had died.
""We will not return to Libya. We will wage war inside Chad."" 
Army spokesman Patrik Steiger said there had been no French air strikes on Thursday and the military was assessing the state and intentions of the convoy. 
A statement after a Chad government meeting said Deby had informed ministers ""the column of mercenaries"" had been completely destroyed.
Deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in 1990 in a military coup. International observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office since, and last year he pushed through constitutional reforms that could keep him in office until 2033.
    France intervened in 2008 to stop the UFR toppling Deby, but President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants a new relationship with France's former colonies and the era of propping up leaders is over.
    However, France considers its former colony as vital in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa and based its 4,500-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force in the capital N'djamena 

The incursion, which Chadian troops had initially attempted to stop, underscores how Deby's fight against Islamist militants in the region has strained his military and hit the oil-dependent economy, leading to growing dissatisfaction in one of the world's poorest nations.

MALE (Reuters) - Maldives police asked the prosecutor general on Thursday to charge former President Abdulla Yameen for providing false information during a probe over his alleged involvement in a deal to lease tropical islands. 
Pro-China Yameen lost a presidential election in September and the new government of his successor, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, has drawn the country closer to India, probing several infrastructure deals awarded to the Chinese.
The investigation relates to a deal to lease tropical islands for hotel development, and an alleged payment of $1 million of government money through a private company, SOF Private Limited, into Yameen's personal bank account. 
Through a spokesman, Yameen denied any wrongdoing.
Police said in a statement that the investigation showed the company was used to embezzle state funds. ""After the investigation, Yameen was told the money belonged to the state and should be returned. The police investigation found that Yameen did not return the money as ordered and instead he conducted financial transactions with the money in ways that would be profitable to him."" 
The state-run Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in 2016 found that SOF, a company launched by former tourism minister Ahmed Adeeb, was used to launder over $92 million from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation, the country's tourism board. 
A spokesman for Yameen said the former president ""does not believe that any funds of the state owned by Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation were deposited into an account owned by Abdulla Yameen"". 
Officials from SOF were not immediately available for comment.
Yameen's government suspended the license of SOF Private Limited in 2017 after Adeeb was jailed on terrorism charges. 
The ACC, which under Yameen's government initially investigated the money transfer to the former leader's personal account, had asked Yameen to return the money in 2018. Yameen later said he had already returned the money.
Police said in December the authorities had frozen the bank accounts of Yameen with 100 million Maldivian Rufiyaa ($6.49 million) in both U.S. dollars and the local currency. 

During Yameen's tenure from 2013-2018, critics alleged that contracts, including a major bridge and an extension to the international airport, were given to Chinese companies at inflated prices.

MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - European and Latin American leaders gathered on Thursday in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo to discuss a plan to solve the deepening crisis in Venezuela, while urging the global community to back away from direct intervention.
The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela opened its inaugural meeting with calls for a more hands-off approach than that advocated by the United States and some other Latin American nations.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the group was pushing for a peaceful and political solution to the crisis, adding that a resolution must ultimately come from the people of Venezuela.
""This is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,"" she said alongside Uruguayan President Tabaré Vázquez.
The Uruguay meeting comes on the heels of a separate meeting of the harder-line Lima Group in Canada, which called for international action to pressure socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to step down.
An economic collapse under Maduro, marked by widespread shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation, has prompted some 3 million people to flee Venezuela and forced nations around the world to clarify their stance on the crisis, particularly after opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president last month.
Maduro was re-elected to a new six-year term as president last May, but the election was widely condemned as a fraud.
A flood of EU nations including Germany, France and Britain have joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognizing Guaido as the rightful interim ruler of the South American nation.
But others remain wary about direct involvement – including some participants at the ICG meeting.
On the eve of the meeting, Mexico, Uruguay and a grouping of Caribbean countries presented a plan for Venezuela, titled the ""Montevideo Mechanism,"" that proposes to find a peaceful solution that will prevent an ""escalation of violence.""
""This is based on good faith, where we don't intervene unless with dialogue, negotiation, communication and a willingness to contribute,"" Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters in Montevideo on Wednesday, echoing comments made earlier this week.
Mexico was once an outspoken critic of Maduro. But ties with Venezuela have warmed under leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month.
'PEACEFUL PROCESS'
Maduro, who retains the loyalty of Venezuela's military, denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him. Maduro is supported by China and Russia. Slovakia and Italy have also refused to recognize Guaido, defying EU and U.S. efforts to coordinate action on Venezuela. 
Lined up behind the ICG are the EU and a number of member states including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain. Latin America members include Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay.
The ICG, launched late last month, has said its aim is to find a ""political and peaceful process"" within 90 days in which Venezuelans determine their own future through the holding of free, transparent and credible elections. 

Some critics, however, say this stance could allow Maduro off the hook, even as pressure builds against him to step down.

Major European Union nations have joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognizing Guaido as the rightful interim ruler of the South American nation.
Faller said Venezuela had about 2,000 generals and the majority of them were loyal to Maduro because of the wealth they have amassed from drug trafficking, petroleum revenue and business revenue. 
Still, he said, rank-and-file soldiers were starving ""just like the population"" of Venezuela.
""The legitimate government of President Guaido has offered amnesty, and a place for the military forces, most of which we think would be loyal to the Constitution, not to a dictator, a place to go,"" Faller said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. watchdog urged Syria on Thursday to grant full rights to its displaced children, adding that thousands had been killed, tortured or enslaved during the country's civil war.
Rights experts said all children living in opposition-held areas and returning as refugees should be given official documents and full access to health, education and social services.
Many displaced or besieged families had not been able to register births due to the war, yet were being fined for late registration, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child said.
The panel of 18 independent experts issued its findings after a two-day review of Syria's record during the conflict. 
""The Committee is very concerned about children who are not registered ...in particular those who are displaced or live in besieged and hard-to-reach areas,"" panel member Jorge Cardona told a news briefing.
Children with Muslim mothers and non-Muslim fathers, or unmarried parents or born as a result of rape were being discriminated against. ""We ask the state to change the law to avoid this situation, which results in children that are stateless,"" Cardona said.
Yasser Kelzy, of Syria's interior ministry, told the panel that birth registrations had been a major wartime challenge, but that a unified civil status office was being set up.
The panel cited credible information on ""thousands of children killed"" in wartime attacks including with ""indiscriminate, disproportionate or unlawful weapons.""
Children have been tortured in detention, others unlawfully recruited by the warring sides or subject to sexual violence, it said, calling for an investigation into possible war crimes.
President Bashar al-Assad has reclaimed most of the country following nearly eight years of civil war, though a peace deal remains elusive. 

The U.N. refugee agency says 5.6 million Syrian refugees live in five neighboring countries - Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq - and it is not yet safe for them to return.

The residential building, in the Kartal district on the Asian side of the city, collapsed on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear why the building had collapsed.
Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the site that the death toll in the incident had risen to six after three more people were pulled out of the rubble. He said 13 others were wounded, two of which were in critical condition.
There were 43 people registered in 14 apartments at the address, but the top three floors of the building had been built illegally, the governor said on Wednesday. He said there was a textile workshop operating without a licence at the entrance.

Initial footage from the incident showed people being pulled out of the rubble as crowds surrounded the site. Roads leading to the building were blocked by vehicles and crowds.

(Reuters) - A Chilean court has opened a fresh case against the country's former army chief for the alleged torture of 24 political prisoners following a military coup in 1973, according to a court document released Thursday.
The Court of Appeal in Chile's northern city of La Serena ordered the investigation against Juan Emilio Cheyre, 71, and other former military officials for allegedly subjecting detainees to beatings, electric shocks, mock executions, water torture, hangings, rapes and sexual assaults. 
An order for Cheyre's arrest was issued on Thursday and he was taken into custody shortly afterwards, pending a judicial hearing later in the day, a spokesman for Chile's investigative police force (PDI) told Reuters. 
Cheyre, who is already under house arrest for another related crime, is the most senior figure so far to be held accountable for abuses committed after Augusto Pinochet overthrew former Chilean President Salvador Allende. 
In November of last year, he was sentenced to three years and one day of house arrest for complicity in the deaths of 15 people.
He served as adjutant to the commander of the infantry regiment for the coastal city of La Serena, 290 miles (470 km) north of Santiago. 
There he witnessed the murder of 15 people by fellow officers on the orders of Chile’s notorious “Caravan of Death” military committee, which traversed the country following the coup, killing and ordering the murder of leftists.
During the dictatorship of the late Pinochet, which lasted 17 years, some 3,000 people died for political reasons and around 28,000 were tortured, including former president, Michelle Bachelet.

Bosnia is formed of the Serb Republic and a federation representing its ethnic Croat and Bosniak Muslim communities, under the peace deal that ended the bloodiest of the 1990s wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.
A massacre of Muslim prisoners in the town of Srebrenica and the long siege and bombardment of the multi-ethnic capital Sarajevo were two of the most notorious crimes of the war, both of which have led to convictions of Serb leaders for genocide.
The Serb region accepted a report in 2004 which endorsed the internationally accepted account that Serb forces killed about 8,000 Muslims in and around Srebrenica. But lawmakers asked the government in August to revoke that report. 
The move was initiated by the region's then-President Milorad Dodik, a nationalist advocate of the Serb Republic's secession from the rest of Bosnia, who is now the chairman of the tripartite presidency of the whole country.
Dodik has rejected rulings by two war crimes courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), that the Srebrenica atrocity constituted genocide.
Though acknowledging a crime occurred, Dodik says the numbers of those killed had been exaggerated, while the number of Serbs killed in the capital Sarajevo had been underestimated.
Serb Republic Justice Minister Anton Kasipovic said the panels were aimed at collecting relevant data and facts about the victims in both towns.
""This is a delicate and complex issue. The basic aim is to clarify all the facts about horrendous sufferings for the sake of the victims and their descendants,"" Kasipovic said. The government said the panels include experts from 12 countries.
The European Union has said it rejects any denial, relativisation or misinterpretation of genocide in Srebrenica. The United States has also said attempts to reject or amend the report on Srebrenica ""are part of wider efforts to revise the facts of the past war, to deny history and to politicize tragedy.""
Around 100,000 people, mainly Bosnian Muslims of whom roughly half were civilians, were killed during the Bosnian war as Bosnian Serb forces, backed by Belgrade, seized swathes of Bosnia and drove out non-Serbs after it voted to secede from Yugoslavia.

One of Britain's most picturesque cities, Edinburgh had 1.75 million foreign visitors on average annually between 2015 and 2017, making it the second most-visited in Britain after London. 
Hotel occupancy was the highest among all UK cities in 2017, at an average of 83.7 percent.
The council said it would use funds raised by the 2-pound ($2.60) per room per night tax ""to improve facilities and better manage the city"", as other European cities such as Barcelona and Rome have done.
The tourist tax has been unpopular with some businesses, however. A survey conducted by the council found only a narrow 51 percent of accommodation-providers supported the idea, which needs a final sign-off by Scotland's devolved parliament.
""This isn't the right time for a new tax and more bureaucracy for small businesses,"" Garry Clark, the head of the Federation of Small Businesses, said on Twitter. 
Hotel associations have also expressed concerns about an extra tax on tourists at an economically sensitive time.
Edinburgh is a craggy World Heritage site with a city-center castle perched on a dormant volcano. A city of half a million inhabitants, it hosts a 60-year old international arts festival in August which attracts a huge number of visitors. 
Last year more than three million people visited its three summer festivals.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations cleared almost 17,000 bombs, suicide belts and other explosive hazards in Iraq last year and the dangerous work of sifting through the debris of war - 7.6 million tonnes in Mosul alone - will take many years, U.N. experts said on Thursday.
There are 100,000 damaged buildings in the country that could harbor explosive hazards such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs) left by retreating Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, said Pehr Lodhammar, head of the U.N. Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in Iraq. 
The bulk of the clearance work is likely to take a decade, and 2 million displaced people are keen to go home. UNMAS trained almost 500,000 people last year to help them recognize the risks. 
Last year's haul of around 17,000 explosive hazards included a ""staggering"" 2,000 IEDs, Lodhammer told a news conference, noting these had pressure plate fuse triggers, trip wires, infrared devices, anti-lift devices, remote control devices, or a combination of those things. 
That figure included 782 suicide belts, many of them actually fitted on dead ISIS fighters found in the debris, he said.
Islamic State held Mosul for three years, and UNMAS arrived when the fighting ended in 2017. Its experts are finding explosive hazards almost everywhere, Lodhammar said. It is also working in Fallujah, Tikrit and Kirkuk, and expanding to Sinjar. 
Picking through the flattened wreckage of Western Mosul in temperatures close to 40 Celsius (105 Fahrenheit) is gruesome work and physically and psychologically demanding, UNMAS director Agnès Marcaillou said. 
""You have decomposing body parts that are still attached to suicide belts. You are walking around in a stench and clouds of flies, and at any given time you can have a rat or a cat or dog actually detonating something that is buried under there,"" she said.
Lodhammar said the task was not traditional one-dimensional mine clearance.
""These are not mines any longer. An anti-personnel mine would have up to 230-250 grams (8.1-8.8 oz) of explosives in it. Now we're looking at 10-20 kilos (22-44 lb)."" 
Buildings up to nine storeys high needed to be searched and made safe, while many of the bombs and shells dropped on Mosul by Iraqi security forces and the U.S.-led coalition had failed to go off, he said.
There were 250-pound (113 kg) bombs and 500-pound bombs, some still buried 7-8 meters (23-26 ft) down. 

Generally at least 10 percent of bombs are assumed not to explode, and if not cleared away they may turn up decades later, like the World War Two bombs that are still discovered in Germany, he said.

Nabih Berri on Wednesday accused Israel of breaching Lebanese waters by licensing a company to exploit the area. Asked about the accusation, Israel's foreign ministry declined to comment.
Lebanon last year licensed a consortium of Italy's Eni, France's Total and Russia's Novatek to carry out the country's first offshore energy exploration in two blocks.
One of the blocks, Block 9, contains waters disputed with Israel. 
Berri, speaking after a meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, said the Israeli move threatened ""to drain a whole basin and a large part of the oil wealth"" before Lebanon had started to drill.
""Therefore it was necessary for us to warn companies including (Italy's) Eni and others and I will raise this matter in France with the French president too"", he said.
Lebanon sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean - along with Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Syria - where a number of big gas fields have been discovered since 2009.
Lebanon has said the dispute would not stop it benefiting from potential undersea reserves in Block 9, while consortium operator Total has said it would not drill the block's first well near the disputed sliver of water.
The unresolved maritime border dispute is over a sea zone of about 860 sq km (330 square miles) which extends along the edge of three of Lebanon's energy blocks.

U.S. diplomats mediated last year after a spike in tensions that also involved a row over a border wall Israel built and over Iran-backed Hezbollah's growing arsenal.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's mining agency plans to ban upstream tailings dams used for storing mining waste, a director at the National Mining Agency (ANM) said on Thursday, after such a dam burst last month, likely killing at least 300 people.
Eduardo Leão, a director at ANM, said the agency aims to issue an ordinance on Friday requiring that such dams be taken down or converted into other types of dams.
A tailings dam at a Vale SA iron ore mine in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais burst on Jan. 25, releasing a torrent of sludge that buried buildings and people. At least 150 people were killed and 182 are missing and presumed dead after the disaster in the town of Brumadinho.
Brazil has 88 upstream tailings dams, according to Leão. It was not immediately clear what kind of deadline the dam operators would face to take down or convert the dams.
The cause of the disaster remains unknown. A state regulatory official told Reuters last week that evidence suggested the dam burst because of liquefaction, a process where solid materials like sand lose strength and stiffness and behave like a liquid.
Vale's dam in Brumadinho was built using the cheapest and least stable type of tailings dam design, known as an ""upstream construction."" Upstream dams are waterlogged and therefore susceptible to cracks that can cause bursts.
A third-party audit of the dam conducted last year found cracks in drainage channels and recommended improvements in monitoring, according to the audit report reviewed by Reuters earlier this week.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan police arrested a team of BBC journalists for illegal possession of prescription drugs, but the country's government spokesman said the reporters had been helping to expose corruption, and demanded their immediate release.
Patrick Onyango, Uganda’s police spokesman, said on Thursday five suspects had been detained overnight. They included two Ugandans and one Kenyan working for the British broadcaster, as well as the wife of a local journalist from NBS Television who was working with them, and a driver.
Fourteen boxes of tablets had been seized, along with other vaccines.
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said the journalists had been cooperating with the State House Health Monitoring Unit to investigate the theft and sale of Ugandan government drugs in neighboring South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo.
""I am yet to find out the logic why police arrested these journalists, who in my view were helping government to unearth the rot which is in the system,"" said Opondo. ""They should be released unconditionally.""
The BBC said it was in contact with the authorities over the case.
Uganda's decrepit healthcare system is riddled with corruption and doctors and nurses frequently complain about shortages of basic supplies like gloves, medicines and vaccines. 
Opondo said that police had told him the journalists were ""intending to embarrass the government"". He said such a reason for their arrest would be ""absurd.""

PRISTINA (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Kosovo has criticized Kosovo's government for hiring an ex-Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander convicted of war crimes as an advisor to the prime minister. 
""Convicted war criminals have no place in Kosovo's government,"" the ambassador, Philip S. Kosnett, wrote on Twitter late on Wednesday.
Sylejman Selimi, sentenced to seven years in prison for war crimes he and his troops committed during the 1998-99 war, was named an adviser to Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj only days after he was released from jail. 
""Leaders of all parties should stop supporting such individuals. Such support calls into question Kosovo’s commitment to the rule of law,"" Kosnett said.
Washington is one of the biggest supporters of Kosovo's independence both politically and financially. But in the past weeks the U.S. administration has criticized Haradinaj for putting 100 percent tariffs on Serbia's goods, halting all its exports to Kosovo, and urged him to undo the decision or face consequences.
Selimi was released on probation on Jan. 25 ahead of the end of the sentence in September 2020.
Selimi, a high-ranking KLA commander and his group, were found guilty in 2015 for beating up a man during the 1998-99 war. 
After the war Selimi was the commander of the Kosovo Protection Force (KPC), later called the Kosovo Security Force (KSF). He left the force in 2011 to become ambassador to Albania until he was indicted in 2013.
Kosovars mostly view the former KLA fighters as heroes for battling Serb forces in the 1998-99 independence war and most of the state institutions are run by ex-soldiers. 
""There is no law that prohibits someone that may have had problems with law to take any position in this country whether in local or central government,"" Selimi's lawyer Tome Gashi told Reuters.
On Wednesday Selimi was also interrogated by The Specialist Chamber that was set up in The Hague in 2015 to handle cases of alleged crimes by KLA guerrillas during the war that led to Kosovo’s secession from Serbia. 
The court has not issued any indictments, but Gashi said Selimi was questioned as a suspect.

PARIS (Reuters) - The Iranian government arrested, imprisoned or executed at least 860 journalists in the three decades between the Islamic revolution in 1979 and 2009, according to documents leaked to media monitoring group Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF).
At a news conference in Paris attended by Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, recipient of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, RSF said whistleblowers had passed on 1.7 million records detailing judicial proceedings against an array of citizens, including minorities, government opponents and journalists.
RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said the group had spent months cross-checking the records with its own documented cases and those of other NGOs, and had established that hundreds of journalists had been targeted by the state.
""The file is a register of all the arrests, imprisonments and executions carried out by the Iranian authorities in the Tehran area over three decades,"" RSF said.
Representatives of the Iranian government were not immediately reachable for comment on Thursday, a holiday in Iran. But last week Iranian authorities reiterated that there were no political prisoners being held in the country.
RSF released the report to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power.
""After months of detailed research work on the file's entries, RSF is in a position to say that at least 860 journalists and citizen-journalists were arrested, imprisoned and in some cases executed by the Iranian regime between 1979 and 2009, the period on which RSF focused its research.""
Deloire said his organization would refer the file to the United Nations high commissioner for human rights in the hope further steps could be taken to hold Iran to account. 
""The very existence of this file and its millions of entries show not only the scale of the Iranian regime's mendacity...but the relentless machinations it used for 40 years to persecute men and women for their opinions or their reporting,"" he said. 
Last month, Amnesty International issued a report accusing the Iranian authorities of a crackdown on dissent during 2018 with more than 7,000 people arrested, among them students, journalists, environmental campaigners and lawyers.
In its analysis, RSF said it had identified at least four journalists who were executed, including Simon Farzami, a Swiss-Iranian of Jewish origin who was bureau chief of French news agency Agence France-Presse when he was arrested in 1980. 
Among the 860 were 218 women.
Beyond the journalists rounded up or imprisoned, RSF said the files showed 61,900 political prisoners had been held since the 1980s, with more than 500 of them aged between 15 and 18. 

It said the files added to evidence of a massacre in 1988 in which around 4,000 political prisoners were executed on the orders of Khomeini between July and September. Iran has always denied that any such massacre took place.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand will investigate the disappearance of a dissident Vietnamese journalist after a rights group said he may have been abducted from Bangkok where he applied for U.N. refugee status, a senior immigration official said on Thursday. 
The disappearance of Radio Free Asia contributor Truong Duy Nhat comes after criticism of Thailand's detention of a Saudi asylum-seeker in January, and the separate arrest of a Bahraini football player with refugee status in Australia who is now fighting extradition back to Bahrain.
Nhat is believed to have been abducted from the Thai capital around Jan. 26 after he fled Vietnam fearing arrest and applied for asylum with the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Amnesty International said this week.
Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said there was no official record of Nhat entering Thailand, but his office was looking into whether he entered the country illegally and what may have happened to him.
""I've ordered an investigation into this matter,"" Surachate told Reuters.
Rights groups called for an investigation after Radio Free Asia reported on Tuesday that Nhat, who was jailed in Vietnam in 2014-15 for ""conducting propaganda against the state"", had gone missing.
""Vietnam has a track record of abducting its exiles and refugees abroad. Thai and Vietnamese authorities must urgently come forward with information about Truong Duy Nhat's disappearance,"" Minar Pimple, Amnesty's senior director for global operations, told Reuters.
Rights groups said Nhat fled to Thailand after receiving a tip that he was in danger of being re-arrested. ""Nhat was in Thailand for one reason only, to apply for asylum and someone obviously didn't want him to - so now the Thai government should launch an immediate investigation to find out what happened to him,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
The UNHCR in Thailand said it could not comment on or confirm individual cases.
Nhat's disappearance is the latest high-profile refugee case in Thailand this year.
Bahraini footballer Hakeem Al Araibi, who has refugee status in Australia, is fighting extradition back to Bahrain after being arrested in a Bangkok airport while on vacation.
The Australian government has appealed to Thailand to release Araibi, saying he faces torture if returned to Bahrain, where he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia on charges related to anti-government Arab Spring protests. 
Bahrain has denied allegations of torture and said Araibi is a fugitive who should be returned. 
Australia said on Thursday it is reviewing its Interpol alerting procedures after its authorities forwarded a ""red notice"" to Thailand that Araibi was wanted by Bahrain, despite his refugee status.
In January, Thai authorities detained an 18-year-old Saudi woman after she said she was fleeing family abuse, but Bangkok halted plans to deport her to Saudi Arabia. The case of Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun ended in her resettlement in Canada.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's churches on Thursday sought to broker talks between the government and its opponents over a political and economic crisis they said had left the country ""angry and traumatized"", after the main opposition snubbed a meeting with the president. 
The southern African nation had hoped to shake off its divided past after a 2017 coup forced long time leader Robert Mugabe from power, but last year's disputed election won by President Emmerson Mnangagwa only deepened political rifts.
A security crackdown on post-election bloodshed in August and another one last month against violent protests has critics saying that under Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe is revisiting the authoritarianism that was the hallmark of Mugabe's regime.
Mnangagwa skipped Thursday's meeting after initially indicating he would attend. He was represented by Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri.
Main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, politicians from smaller parties, diplomats, business leaders and several cabinet ministers attended Thursday's meeting, the first such gathering since Mnangagwa first came to power in November 2017.
Church leaders said they had stepped forward to mediate and reconcile political parties, which would lay the basis for the recovery of an economy battling a severe dollar shortage that has sapped supplies of fuel and medicines.
""Zimbabwe is clearly a hurting, angry and traumatized nation,"" Bishop Ambrose Moyo, who heads the Ecumenical Church Leaders Forum, said during a prayer meeting with politicians.
""Such a dialogue as initiated by the churches will help us to do some serious introspection as we speak to one another. We stand committed to this process, set up by the united church to build peace, unity and prosperity.""
Some ruling party officials have accused Chamisa and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) of only seeking talks to be accommodated in government, which the opposition denies.
The last time the MDC held talks with the ruling ZANU-PF in 2008 resulted in the formation of a unity government that ushered a period of political and economic stability. 
Striking a defiant tone, Chamisa said Zimbabwe's political and economic problems would not be fixed until the issue of Mnangagwa's legitimacy was resolved. He backed the church initiative, saying the clergy were independent mediators.
Chamisa said any dialogue that did not involve Mnangagwa and himself would not succeed. He repeated demands for the removal of the military from the streets and release of hundreds of people jailed during the mid-January protests. 
""We can't have dialogue while other people are in prison on account of politics. As I come to you I am a leader to members of parliament who cannot even sleep in their houses on account of politics, on account of accusations,"" said Chamisa.
Chamisa, who sat with two cabinet ministers, snubbed Wednesday's talks with Mnangagwa, saying the dialogue must be brokered by an independent outside mediator. 

In a speech read for him by Muchinguri-Kashiri, Mnangagwa said his doors would remain open for dialogue.

GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Egle Possetti has to avert her eyes when she drives past the remains of the road bridge in Genoa as she cannot bear looking at the place where her sister was killed along with her family.
A 200-metre-long section of the Morandi bridge, part of a motorway linking the Italian port city with southern France, gave way on Aug. 14 last year in busy lunchtime traffic, sending dozens of vehicles into free-fall and killing 43 people.
On Friday, some six months later, builders will start demolishing sections of the bridge ahead of its reconstruction.
For Possetti, 53, just seeing what is left is too much. 
""For us, seeing this structure broken in two every time we come is really terrible. And to think underneath 43 people lost their lives and apart from anything else, almost all of them were young people,"" she told Reuters. 
    Her sister Claudia, Claudia's husband Andrea, and children Camilla, 16, and Manuele, 12, were killed. They had been heading to a resort east of Genoa for the Aug. 15 public holiday. Possetti started to fear the worst when she could not reach any of them by cellphone.
    ""Every minute of your life you think about it. You may laugh, smile, but you're dead inside,"" Possetti said as she tried not to look at the ruins.
    Possetti is now part of a committee calling on Italian lawmakers to speed up judicial investigations when dealing with tragedies such as the bridge collapse.
Her despair is shared by Giovanna Donato, whose son Cesare, 11, lost his father, also called Andrea, from whom she had separated.
""I would like it morally to remain a symbol, let's not forget that the bridge collapsed and people died. It should not have happened,"" the 42-year-old said.
Marco Bucci, Genoa mayor and special commissioner for bridge reconstruction, said he was pleased with the rebuilding development so far.
""Since the afternoon of Aug. 14, when we became aware of the tragedy, we rolled up our sleeves and started working immediately. The whole city did the same,"" he said. ""Every time a segment of the bridge is demolished or rebuilt we prove to the citizens that this is the way things should be done."" 
After the bridge collapse, the Italian government blamed operator Autostrade per l'Italia for poor maintenance of the viaduct and threatened to revoke the group's concessions. Autostrade has denied any wrongdoing in the disaster.

The reconstruction contract has been awarded to Italy's biggest builder Salini Impregilo and shipbuilder Fincantieri. Demolition and reconstruction of the new bridge is planned to take about 15 months.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Like many Iranians, retired judge Mohammad Reza made big sacrifices to help Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini launch his Islamic Revolution, enduring torture in prison for handing out leaflets calling for an end to the Shah's long dictatorship.
When Khomeini returned from exile in Paris on a special Air France charter to millions of ecstatic supporters on February 1, 1979, Mohammad Reza, now 72, was among the crowds at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport.
""I still remember crying and chanting 'as the demon left, the angel arrived',"" he said by telephone from his home in Tehran, declining to give his family name for security reasons.
The revolution which swept Iran 40 years ago this month united influential bazaar traders, intellectuals and people of all classes against the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's lavish lifestyle, secret police and Western-style social and economic reforms.
Iran's leaders still chant the trademark ""Down with America"" slogan of the revolt, sometimes in front of vast crowds, but they no longer inspire Mohammad Reza, and some other aged revolutionaries, who are now among the most vocal critics of the clerical leadership.
First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri said the revolution had brought Iranians independence, freedom and justice in a speech this week to mark its anniversary on Monday. ""Thanks to it, people were able to govern their destiny,"" he said.
Mohammad Reza noted that freedom, independence and social justice were the gains the Ayatollah promised, but said using those words was now out of the question for ordinary people.
""You can get arrested today if you repeat the Imam's (Khomeini's) values and goals publicly,"" he said.
I WAS THERE
In 2009, Mohammad Reza said his grandson Arash was jailed and tortured in Tehran's notorious Evin prison -- where Mohammad Reza had been detained under the Shah -- as security forces crushed an uprising following disputed presidential elections.
""At the beginning we did not know where he was or whether he was even alive,"" the former judge said. ""I used my friends from the time of the revolution who had important positions in the government to locate him.""
Iranian officials say protests and criticism of the Islamic Republic are driven by external forces intent on destroying it.
Mohammad Reza said he did not want another revolution but a return to Khomeini's revolutionary principles.
As a junior judge under Khomeini, he said he served underdeveloped areas, hoping they would prosper in the new Iran. “I helped the revolution in my own way. By helping the poor.""
Images of the turbaned Khomeini that now plaster walls across Iran and are held aloft by pro-government demonstrators remind him of the man he fought for in Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, which claimed a total one million lives. His son-in-law lost a leg in the conflict.
""Whenever the revolution needed me, I was there. My wife and my daughters cooked for soldiers during the war,"" he said.
After retiring 10 years ago, he opened a small grocery shop.
""I know many people who cannot even buy basic goods for their families. They come to my shop and I give them those goods,"" he said. ""We did not do the revolution to make a group of elite rich.""
The authorities have acknowledged there is corruption in Iran but say they are tackling it.
Under decades of rule by the Shah, the self-proclaimed ""king of kings"", a huge gap emerged between rich and poor: a 1971 party for world leaders in a specially created oasis only served to highlight the gulf.
During months of increasingly violent protests, Iranians chanted ""Death to Shah"" before the Shah and his wife, Empress Farah Pahlavi, left Tehran and flew to Aswan to Egypt on January 16, 1979.
Now, much smaller numbers of protesters call for ""Death to Dictator"" during demonstrations against economic hardships they blame on President Hassan Rouhani, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards, who have extensive business interests.
The country is engaged in costly proxy conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen but has struggled economically since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions.
Prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged.
In January, Rouhani said Iran is facing its worst economic crisis since the Shah was toppled. The World Bank anticipates inflation in Iran jumping to 23.8 percent in 2018-19 from 9.6 percent in 2017-18, and to 31.2 percent in 2019-20.
Last year, Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards in over 80 cities and towns that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical leadership since the 2009 revolt. Khamenei blamed ""enemies of the Islamic Republic"".
Small, sporadic protests continue over issues such as unpaid wages but nothing on the scale of last year.
Mohammad Reza said he sympathized with the demonstrators. ""Their wages weren’t paid. They cannot pay their rents,"" he said.
Living with his wife and two daughters and their families in a small house in southern Tehran, he is nostalgic for the hopeful early days of the revolution which ended Persia’s 2,500-year-old Peacock Throne. 
But more than three-quarters of the population of 85 million is under the age of thirty, a generation Mohammad Reza said was less influenced by the revolutionary era that forms the bedrock of the clerical establishment.
""When I see how this system is pushing our young generation away from Islam and the pillars of the revolution, I feel sad and desperate,"" he said.

The number of prisoners that will be pardoned by Khamenei was not announced, but Iranian media earlier said around 50,000 prisoners will enjoy ""the Islamic clemency"".
The country is holding official celebrations for the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that will culminate next Monday in a nationwide rally.
It was not immediately clear whether those who will be pardoned will include some of the hundreds of prisoners that human rights groups say have been jailed for political offences.
Several dual nationals from the United States, Britain, Austria, Canada and France have been detained by Iran's security forces in past years and have been kept behind bars on charges including espionage and collaborating with hostile governments.

Khamenei has the final say on all state matters and issues pardons or reduces sentences of prisoners on special occasions.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Myanmar villagers flee fresh Rakhine State fighting, enter Bangladesh","YANGON/DHAKA (Reuters) - Scores of ethnic minority villagers have crossed from western Myanmar into Bangladesh in recent days amid fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic Rakhine rebels, Bangladesh border guards and an activist said on Thursday.
Members of 38 families said they fled their homes fearing attack from military helicopters, said Colonel Zahirul Haque Khan, the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) commander in Bandarban district where the group of 136 people are now living in shelters.
Clashes between Myanmar's military and the insurgent Arakan Army, which mainly recruits from the Rakhine ethnic group, have displaced more than 5,000 people in parts of Rakhine and Chin states since early December. 
Myanmar's leaders have vowed to crush the rebels, who are fighting for autonomy for Rakhine State, and blocked most aid agencies from reaching the area, raising fears of more civilian suffering in an area long scarred by complex ethnic divisions. 
While Rakhine State is majority Buddhist, in 2017 attacks on security posts by insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority provoked a military crackdown that forced 730,000 people from their homes and into camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, according to U.N. agencies.
Win Thein, a member of the non-governmental Bangladesh Human Rights Commission, said he had visited the refugees, who are members of the Khumi, Cho and Rakhine ethnic groups, in their remote jungle camp.
They had crossed into Bangladesh on Sunday and Monday after fleeing from two villages in Chin state's rugged Paletwa township after they heard gunfire and saw helicopters nearby, he said. 
Some villagers said they later witnessed Myanmar soldiers looting and setting fire to homes, he said.
Two spokesmen for the Myanmar military and the government's main spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not pick up phone calls seeking comment on Thursday.
Win Thein said some of the refugee children were seriously ill and had no access to medical care.
""There are no blankets at all and it is very cold,"" he said.
Bangladesh summoned Myanmar's ambassador on Tuesday to protest over the new arrivals, according to a senior Bangladesh foreign ministry official.
Brigadier General Sazedur Rahman, a BGB regional commander, said Bangladesh had beefed up security near the border to prevent more refugee arrivals.
The United Nations refugee agency in Cox's Bazar was trying to gather more information about the new arrivals, said spokesman Firas Al-Khateeb.
""We'll coordinate with the government so we will be able to help them as soon as possible,"" he said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The arrest of a group of ethnic Pashtun activists at a rally in Pakistanthis week rekindled an angry row with neighbouring Afghanistan on Thursday as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned Islamabad's treatment of the protesters.
The members of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) were detained during an Islamabad protest against police violence on Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves against the group which was founded a year ago to protest the death of a Pashtun man killed by police in the Pakistani port city of Karachi.
Islamabad's crackdown against the group, whose support comes mainly from the northwestern region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has drawn criticism and protests from over the border in Afghanistan, where Pashtuns are estimated to be the largest single ethnic group.
Tuesday's incident, reopening longstanding tensions between Kabul and Islamabad, comes as Pakistan has been supporting efforts to open a peace process with the Taliban to end more than 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
""The Afghan government has serious concerns about the violence perpetrated against peaceful protesters and civil activists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,"" Ghani, himself a Pashtun, wrote in a tweet.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi rejected Ghani's comment. ""Such irresponsible statements are only gross interference,"" he said in a tweet, adding that Ghani should focus on the ""longstanding grievances of the Afghan people"".
Tuesday's protests followed the death of PTM regional leader Arman Loni in southwestern Balochistan province which the group blamed on police. 
Mohsin Dawar, a member of parliament and founding member of PTM, said police had singled Loni out and beat him to death.
A police spokesman said Loni died of a heart attack after clashes between protesters and police.
PTM leader and member of parliament Ali Wazir told Reuters that 18 activists were still in custody after one of those detained was released this week. 
Rights group Amnesty International issued a statement saying authorities ""must immediately and unconditionally release protesters belonging to the peaceful Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement"".
""It is shocking that the Pakistani authorities have resorted to such heavy-handed methods,"" Amnesty South Asia researcher Rabia Mehmood said.
PTM blames the military and other state agencies for what it says are forced disappearances resulting in thousands of missing persons' cases, mainly from the Pashtun region bordering Afghanistan.
The group is viewed with deep suspicion by the military which says it undermines Pakistan. The army has said it does not detain individuals without evidence.
The arrest last month of senior PTM leader Alamzeb Mehsud in Karachi drew an outcry on social media. He was charged under anti-terrorism and public order laws, but his supporters say he was arrested for protesting against abuses by the military.
Following a series of nationwide protests last year, hundreds of PTM activists were arrested and detained across the country in a large-scale crackdown. 
Dawar and Wazir, founding PTM members, were elected to parliament in July from the Pashtun majority Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan, highlighting the group's growing appeal among Pakistan's 35 million Pashtuns.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>","'Do something:' After school shooting, Florida mother chooses action","By Letitia Stein
PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - After screaming out on national television for President Donald Trump to ""please do something"" to prevent another school shooting like the one that had just killed her daughter, Lori Alhadeff heeded her own call for action.
She was powerless when gunfire silenced 14-year-old Alyssa on Feb. 14, 2018. But in the year since 17 people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Alhadeff ran for the local school board and won. She started a non-profit. She raised money to equip schools with bulletproof glass and emergency medical stop-the-bleed kits.
On Wednesday, she was in New Jersey, her former home, to watch the governor sign an ""Alyssa's Law"" named after her daughter. She hopes other states will follow in requiring schools to have silent panic alarms to notify law enforcement in emergencies.
""I had no control on Feb. 14. And as a mother, when you have your children, you need control,"" Alhadeff said in an interview with Reuters. ""But now I have the control. I have this power, and I am using that power by using my voice.""
Alhadeff is among the Parkland parents who have channeled their anguish into advocacy. Instead of dance recitals, soccer matches and marching band performances, their schedules now involve lobbying trips to state capitols, the U.S. Congress and the White House. 
Some served on a state commission that reviewed the Parkland shooting, documenting each failure before and after the firing of the first bullet in a freshmen classroom building. Others have waded into partisan politics to campaign for local and federal candidates pledging to do more for school safety.
For Fred Guttenberg, fighting for gun control is a way to cope when he thinks about the final moments for his daughter, Jaime, who ran down a hallway with a shooter at her back.
""What I have discovered this year is I have this need to still be Jaime's dad,"" he said. ""I am not going to ever stop talking about my daughter and what she meant to me – and what the moments without her mean to me.""
Success can be both satisfying and hollow.
""It doesn't bring my son back,"" said Max Schachter, who has focused on identifying best practices for school security after his son, Alex, died with Alhadeff's daughter in English class.
Alhadeff, 43, once ordered her life around her children's soccer teams. She now races between school functions and activities for the non-profit, Make Our Schools Safe, she started after Alyssa's death. 
""I know that she would say to me, if I was like sleeping in bed: 'Mom what are you doing? Why are you wasting your time? You need to get out there and fight for me,'"" Alhadeff said.
MOTHER FOR CHANGE
As a stay-at-home mother of three, Alhadeff jokingly called herself Alyssa's personal assistant. She drove her daughter to the movies, the beach and sporting events - even laying out her shoes with the laces turned just so for her to slip right on.
While her children were at school, Alhadeff played tennis and grocery shopped. To support their teams, she sold cookies and Gatorade at their soccer games.
Last month, Alhadeff cried while recalling those memories. She was again sitting on the sidelines, watching her second child practice soccer where his sister once played. He wears Alyssa's No. 8 on his jersey.
It was at an adjacent park that Alhadeff asked a reporter for a microphone following the school shooting, not long after making preliminary plans for her daughter's funeral.
Angry with raw grief, she begged Trump in a live CNN broadcast to take action because she said he was the most powerful person who came to mind.
Late last year, Alhadeff joined a group of Parkland parents to meet with Trump at the White House and discuss a national safety commission he created after the shooting.
Her anger has eased, she said, as she focuses on school safety as the only new member of the Broward County School Board, where she is calling for the removal of the superintendent in charge when her daughter was killed at school.
""I don't see myself as a politician,"" Alhadeff said. ""I see myself as a mother wanting to make change.""
She has planned a full day to mark the one-year date from Alyssa's death - gravesite prayers, lunch at her house, a clean-up event at Alyssa's favorite beach and community memorial. Staying busy is better than having too much time to think, she said.
But in quiet moments, when she needs to feel close to Alyssa, Alhadeff dabs on perfume from her daughter's pink Victoria's Secret bottle. She wears her daughter's gray sweatshirt with white splotches, which Alyssa bleached in a laundry mishap.

""I am just trying to live for her,"" she said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",Malaysia's ex-PM Najib gears up for graft trial with charm offensive,"By Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Disgraced former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been out in recent weeks campaigning as if for an election, trying to shed the image of a wealthy, elite politician and elicit public sympathy before his corruption trial begins on Tuesday.
Najib has pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering, in what is set to be the first of many trials over suspected multibillion-dollar fraud at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
The trial starts nine months after Malaysians voted Najib out of office in a general election dominated by public disgust over allegations some $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, and about a quarter of it went into his personal bank accounts.
Police found nearly $300 million worth of goods and cash at properties linked to Najib soon after the May 2018 election. 
But as the trial date nears, Najib - who has maintained his innocence - has sought a radical change of image, painting himself as a victim of a vindictive government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
The 65-year-old son of Malaysia’s second prime minister is also trying to build an image as a folksy voice of working people, especially members of the ethnic Malay majority. 
Najib, in a viral video last month, crooned a Malay-language version of the 1970s hit 'Kiss and Say Goodbye', surrounded by a chorus of somber young singers, criticizing Mahathir's coalition for failing to live up to election promises. 
""On May 9, 2018, I was ousted. All this time, I have been fighting with my life for the people I love. But what can I do?"" an earnest Najib says of his ""saddest day"" in the introduction to the song.
Najib has also been hitting out online. His jibes against ruling party politicians on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter have some social media users referring to him as ""King of Trolls"".
A relaxed, casually dressed Najib also paid a visit this month to Langkawi, Mahathir's island constituency, where he pottered around town, visiting markets, eating at hawker stalls and rubbing elbows and posing for selfies with passersby.
Mahathir was not impressed. He told a news conference last week Najib seemed to be getting popular on social media because ""he provides a lot of stories"".
Harvinderjit Singh, one of Najib's lawyers, declined to comment on the former premier's public appearances but said the 1MDB trials were unlikely to be affected by the hoopla.
""The case is going to be determined by what happens in court, not out of it,"" he said.
1MDB TRIAL
While Najib has been trying to build public support, the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) has been building a formidable team to prosecute Najib, his wife and a host of other former top officials charged for corruption. All of them have pleaded not guilty.
The prosecution has been recruiting top notch criminal attorneys including former federal court judge Gopal Sri Ram and Sulaiman Abdullah, a lawyer with a background in cases of white-collar crime.
The AGC has also recalled several prosecutors from state offices to join the team, two lawyers with knowledge of the matter said. 
The AGC did not respond to a request for comment. 
Najib has a defense team of eight lawyers, led by Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, who once represented the government in a sodomy case against former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
Najib could face years in prison. He faces 39 criminal charges over losses at 1MDB and other state entities.
Seven of those charges will be the subject of Tuesday's trial, relating to transfers totaling 42 million ringgit ($10.30 million) into Najib's personal bank account from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.
Prosecutors have handed nearly 3,000 pages of documents to the defense ahead of the trial, said Najib's lawyer Singh. 
The documents include statements from 26 witnesses, some of whom were SRC officials, who will likely be called to testify.
Najib, who has not been asked to testify in his own defense, hopes only for a fair trial, Singh said.

""Our client is of the view that if he gets a fair trial, then the truth will show itself to the public,"" he said.

The men entered Indonesia as tourists via Bali and the city of Yogyakarta with the intention of going to Malaysia for work, North Sumatra's immigration chief said. 
""They are victims of human trafficking and were lured here,"" Fery Monang Sihite said by telephone, adding that the men had been locked up in Medan on the island of Sumatra.
The men, who were described as in a healthy condition when they were found on Tuesday night, had been taken to an immigration detention center and would be sent back to Bangladesh, Sihite said. 
One of the men, named as 39-year old Mahbub, was quoted by online news portal Tribun Medan as saying that some of the group had been held by the traffickers for three months. 
""All of us were conned. The destination was meant to be Malaysia. We left from Bangladesh to Bali and arrived here after taking a four-day bus trip,"" Mahbub was quoted as saying.
Reuters could not immediately reach the men or police for comment.
Authorities were first alerted to the case after neighbors had reported hearing suspicious noises coming from the building, according to media.
Sihite said the men were not Rohingya Muslims. 
Hundreds of Rohingya have landed by boat in Sumatra in recent years after fleeing Myanmar and Bangladesh, often intending to reach Malaysia.
Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling camps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.

More than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh after fleeing an army crackdown in the north of Rakhine, according to U.N. agencies.

State broadcaster SABC said about 20 people were still stuck underground at the mine in Middleburg. 
Rescue efforts were hampered by dangerously high levels of toxic gas underground, SABC said. 
The mine is owned by Tegeta Resources and Exploration, which is undergoing creditor protection after its owners, the Gupta brothers, found it difficult to continue doing business in South Africa following corruption allegations against them.
Several people had entered the mine on Wednesday afternoon to steal copper wires that supply electricity for lighting and ventilation when a gas pipe exploded, police spokesman Leonard Hlati said.
""The mine is wired with copper. They were going for copper,"" Hlati said.
Copper is often stolen from disused mines in South Africa and sold for scrap.
The Gupta brothers, their lawyers and officials from their firms and family representatives could not be reached for comment about the mine incident. 
The brothers - who headed what was one of the country's biggest conglomerates - were accused of unduly influencing former president Jacob Zuma over political appointments and winning contracts.
Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An India state will give gold worth about $530 to every bride from a poor family, the latest budget giveaway ahead of a general election that must be held by May.
The northeastern state of Assam is run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is facing a battle for re-election because of low farm incomes and a lack of jobs that have turned off some of those who backed it in the last polls, in 2014.
The federal government announced cash handouts to farmers and tax cuts for the lower middle class last week.
On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut interest rates for the first time since 2017, in line with a government demand as it attempts to stimulate the economy.
The opposition Congress party has also been forgiving farmers' loans and announcing it would provide the unemployed with cash handouts in some of the states it controls.
But handing out gold to brides is new.
The tea-growing state's finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, allocated 3 billion rupees ($42 million) for the next fiscal year, from April 1, for the gold program.
That would buy 875 kg of gold, enough for about 80,000 brides.
""A customary ritual which has been part of Assamese society for centuries is to gift a set of gold ornaments to one's daughter as a blessing as she leaves her father's home to start a new life,"" Sarma said in his budget speech on Wednesday.
He said the program should stop families falling into debt to pay for daughters' weddings.
""I feel that it's my solemn responsibility to stand with those fathers who cannot afford to gift a set of gold ornaments,"" he said.
The Assam government would buy the gold from the RBI and give it to the beneficiaries directly, Sarma told Reuters on Thursday.
The program would be limited to two women from each family with an income of less than 500,000 rupees ($7,000) a year. Each bride would get a ""tola"", or 11.66 grams, of gold.
Indian brides traditionally get gold, which helps make the country the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China. The World Gold Council expects India to consume 750-850 tonnes of gold this year.
The Assam government hasn't stopped at gold.
Sarma said the state would also give electric bikes to girls who score at least 60 percent in school-leaving exams, for getting to places of higher studies.
He rejected opposition accusations he was making ""fake promises"" to win votes.
Political parties and candidates find different ways to give presents to voters.
In the past, gifts have included electric fans, laptops, pressure cookers and televisions.

Under the election law, the gift-giving has to stop once an election date is set.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>",Explainer: The race for Nigeria's presidency in 2019,"By Paul Carsten
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerians will on Feb. 16 choose between two septuagenarians to lead Africa's largest democracy: President Muhammadu Buhari and former vice president Atiku Abubakar. The pair have run for president nine times between them. 
There are more than 60 other candidates, though their chances of winning are slim as the wealth and patronage networks of the two main parties drive the politics of Africa's top oil producer and most populous country.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
Buhari's 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats. 
The government says it is making progress but the military's efforts to fight the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency and its Islamic State-allied offshoot, now in its tenth year, are crumbling. 
The economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari, yet the average Nigerian is still getting poorer; and opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, targeting only the president's enemies and ignoring allegations against his allies. 
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses, including the massacre of protesters. The army has said its use of force is justified. 
After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups and other critics said Buhari was unfit for office and his administration was beset by inertia. But the president has said he is strong enough to serve. 
If Buhari wins again, Nigeria would be in for another four years of political torpor and disregard for rights, his opponents say.
The president said he would continue to develop the rail and road network if reelected for a second term. He has also vowed to expand a nationwide vocational skills program, improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and continue his fight against corruption.
Atiku, the candidate of the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP), has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
His businesses include a port logistics firm and a private university. He has promised business-friendly policies to double the size of the economy to $900 billion by 2025 if elected.
He wants to privatize parts of the state oil company and create a $25 billion fund to support private sector infrastructure investment.
Atiku's opponents say he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him. 
FAULT LINES AND FRACTURES
Nigeria is deeply divided. The north is mainly Muslim and the south is largely Christian and the population is fairly evenly split between religions. There are also more than 200 ethnic groups. The three largest are the Hausa in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Igbo in the southeast.
The divisions have led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement among Nigeria's political elite. The presidency is supposed to alternate between the north and south after every two four-year terms. 
Buhari, a northern Muslim, is in his first term, having held the post since 2015. His predecessor, the PDP's Goodluck Jonathan, is a southern Christian. In keeping with the accord, the PDP selected Atiku, a northerner, as its candidate for 2019.
As it is not the turn of a southerner, and both Atiku and Buhari are Muslims from the Fulani ethnic group - one of the largest in the north - the chance of election violence around ethnicity, religion and region is reduced. However, the south has favored the PDP in the past, while the north is Buhari's stronghold. 
In the diverse Nigerian hinterland states known as the Middle Belt, the picture is less clear. Long-running violence over diminishing arable land between farmers and nomadic herders has exploded, with a death toll of more than 3,600 since 2016, according to Amnesty International.
This could turn the Middle Belt, much of which voted for Buhari, into swing states.
GENERATION GAP
Nigeria's median age is just 18, according to the United Nations. Many youths say the aging leaders are out of touch and started the ""Not Too Young to Run"" campaigns to encourage younger people to seek office.
Buhari, 76, is the oldest person to lead Nigeria since the transition to civilian government in 1999 and the PDP chose 72-year-old Atiku as their candidate. Both men have said they remain energetic enough to take on the top job. 
Nigeria's former military leaders also retain a strong influence over politics nearly two decades after the start of civilian rule. 
Buhari himself is a retired general who was head of state from 1983-1985. Other military-era chiefs continue to wield political leverage, including Olusegun Obasanjo, who led the country in the 1970s and was president from 1999-2007, and Ibrahim Babangida, who ruled from 1985-1993. Both back Atiku.
THE PARTIES
The two main parties, the ruling APC and opposition PDP, do not have clear ideological differences. Competition for control of national oil revenues by elites, patronage and complex rivalries between ethnic groups have played a much bigger role in elections than ideology.
However, Buhari's 2019 campaign has prioritized poverty alleviation and social schemes, while Atiku has stressed the need for a better business environment. Both vow to improve the decrepit infrastructure.
Buhari won in 2015 after assembling a broad coalition across the north and southwest under the APC party, a version of the other vehicles he used to run in 2003, 2007 and 2011.
The PDP has links to the military and held power until Jonathan's defeat in 2015. The party has traditionally appealed to the business community, which developed during the military regime.
Atiku, a long-time PDP member, joined the APC and became a key ally and funder of Buhari during the 2015 campaign, allowing him to use the tycoon's private jet. Atiku switched sides in late 2017.
ELECTION INTERFERENCE
International observers and civil society groups fear election interference and rigging. They expressed concern about the way some state level votes were conducted last year and have called for free and fair elections to take place. 
The 2015 contest is the only time Nigeria has had a handover of power from a defeated incumbent since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then, independent observers saw evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation and other forms of corruption.
Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes, over his alleged violation of wealth declaration rules. The judge has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal investigating the allegations does not have the authority to try him.
The European Union, United States and Britain said they were concerned about the move. Nigeria said foreign governments should ""tread with caution"" and that their interference was ""insulting"".
The elections feature in discussions and on news feeds in social media. The government launched a campaign against ""fake news"". Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it would roll out some of its political advertising rules and tools for curbing election interference to Nigeria. 
The National Security Adviser's office released a statement on Feb. 1 saying the internet would not be shut down during the vote.
TURNOUT AND RUNOFFS
Voter turnout in the 2015 election was 29.4 million, or 44 percent of the 67.4 million registered voters, according to Independent National Electoral Commission data. For 2019, the number of registered voters has risen by a quarter to 84 million, with just over half of them aged 18-35. 

The candidate with the most votes is declared winner as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off.

The 1987 treaty eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers, but leaves other countries free to produce and deploy them. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would like to hold talks aimed at creating a new arms control treaty. 
""We of course saw the reference in president Trump's statement to the possibility of a new treaty that could be signed in a beautiful room and that this treaty should also include other countries as its participants,"" Ryabkov said. 
""We look forward to this proposal being made concrete and put on paper or by other means..."" Ryabkov said at a news conference in Moscow. 

Ryabkov said the United States had not sent Moscow any concrete proposals for a new pact.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 11:38PM ET</span>","With border blocked, desperate Venezuelans ask how U.S. aid will arrive","By Anggy Polanco and Nelson Bocanegra
URENA, Venezuela/CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Desperate Venezuelans asked on Wednesday how they would gain access to U.S. food and medicine aid due to arrive via the Colombia border after President Nicolas Maduro's government blocked the frontier crossing to any humanitarian shipments.
Despite widespread hunger and shortages of staple goods in Venezuela, Maduro vowed to turn back U.S. aid after President Donald Trump's administration last month recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful interim ruler of the South American nation.
Venezuelan security forces blocked the three-lane border crossing from the Colombian town of Cucuta on Tuesday using two shipping containers and a fuel tanker. Armed Venezuelan soldiers stood guard at the customs building, pledging to turn back any attempt to cross the border.
The Cucuta crossing was quiet on Wednesday but Colombian migration officials pulled back a little from the border line, citing the rising tensions with Venezuela.
In the Venezuelan border town of Urena, residents signed up to unofficial waiting lists for aid.
""We're desperate. Our money is not worth anything. Maduro may not like the help, but he should think about people who do not have anything to eat,"" said Livia Vargas, 40. ""I signed up on a list to receive aid but then they told us that it would not work like that.""
The largest city along the frontier, Cucuta has been a transit route for many of the 3 million Venezuelans who have fled in recent years. Thousands of people cross four pedestrian bridges that connect the city with Venezuela on daily entry passes to shop for food.
International pressure is growing on Maduro to step down after major European Union nations this week joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader following Maduro's re-election last year in a vote critics called a sham.
Guaido, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, has urged the military to turn on Maduro and support a transition to democracy.
U.S. officials told Reuters aid was on its way this week.
Colombian and U.S. authorities have remained silent on how they plan to distribute the aid without Maduro's approval.
Shipments are also due to come from Venezuelan companies abroad, Colombia, Canada and Germany.
Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said on Wednesday airplanes had arrived in Colombia and paperwork was being handled to send the aid to Cucuta. It was not clear where they arrived or what was on board.
'PEOPLE NEED HELP'
Peering through cracks in a sheet metal fence to an area where U.S. humanitarian aid is due to be stockpiled in Cucuta, Venezuelan Yesica Leonett pleaded for information on how her four children can benefit from the donations.
""People need help. My children eat boiled banana skins, shredded like meat,"" said Leonett, 31, who fled Venezuela eight months ago. ""What a joy to get help to my children. An even greater joy would be to get rid of Maduro.""
Police who provide security on the Colombian side of the bridge told Reuters there has been a huge number of Venezuelans asking when and where the aid will be delivered.
""There's nothing to tell them because we don't have any information. Sometimes they despair but we can't do anything, it's so sad,"" said a patrolman located a few yards (meters) from the border.
Colombia has received more than 1.1 million Venezuelans, with about 3,000 entering each day. Government estimates reach 4 million by 2021 if the crisis in Venezuela is not resolved.
""I'd like to believe this is the beginning of a new Venezuela, but I've seen so many attempts by the opposition fail, I prefer not to have false hopes,"" Venezuelan Carmen Perez, 67, said in a trembling voice as she bought eggs from the back of a truck.

ABUJA (Reuters) - A key ally of Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the country's election to be held in little over a week would go back in body bags. 
Nasir El-Rufai, governor of the northern state of Kaduna, made the comments during a discussion program on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community's role in elections was raised. It followed an international outcry over the suspension of Nigeria's top judge. 
The Feb. 16 vote in Africa's top oil producer pits Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015, against main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president in a race widely seen as tight that has become increasingly rancorous in the last few weeks. 
The discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the program in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules.
""We are waiting for the person who will come and intervene. They will go back in body bags because nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country,"" said El-Rufai. 
""We have got that independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible,"" he said.
Last year Buhari and Atiku both signed an agreement stating a commitment to hold a peaceful election. 
Following El-Rufai's comments, the main opposition People's Democratic Party said it would be ""left with no option than to consider a review of its signatory in the national peace accord"" if the ruling party did not stop ""comments, threats and incendiary actions"". 
The chief justice - who was suspended and replaced with an acting replacement last month - could preside over a dispute over the election result. Nigeria's judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging.
Last week the Nigerian government said it would not accept any foreign ""meddling"" after statements by the EU, the United States and Britain expressed fears about the impact of the judge's suspension if the election result was disputed.

""While the security of EU observers is of paramount importance, and will remain under constant review, EU observers will continue their work across the country in the run-up to - and beyond - the 16 February elections,"" said the EU election observation mission in a tweet in which it stated that it was aware of the governor's comments.

PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Mexico (Reuters) - Some Central American migrants seeking entry into the United States but stalled near a Texas crossing said on Wednesday they are considering moving to another part of the border, where they may have a better chance of lodging a speedy asylum claim.
Mulling their next move from the dusty Mexican town of Piedras Negras, just south of the Eagle Pass crossing on the U.S. side, the latest group of around 1,700 caravan migrants want to avoid a potentially months-long wait for a chance to plead their case for asylum.
Many say they are also waiting for a so-called humanitarian visa from the Mexican government that could lead to local job opportunities, but are afraid of the area's hyper-violent Zetas drug cartel that has targeted migrants in the past.
""We can't stop here,"" said Oscar Lopez, a 33-year-old Honduran traveling with his wife and two daughters. 
He said that his family fled death threats from gangs back home. ""If we don't (cross) here, we'll go to anther part of the border,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that 3,750 additional military troops would be sent to the U.S.-Mexico border to support border agents and thwart what he described as ""the tremendous onslaught"" of U.S.-bound migrants.
Asylum seekers have traditionally been granted the right to stay in the United States while their cases were decided by a U.S. immigration judge, but a backlog of more than 800,000 cases means the process can take years. 
Some 250 military personnel are being re-deployed from positions in Arizona to Eagle Pass ""in response to migrant caravan activity currently approaching the Texas border,"" the U.S. Department of Defense announced on Wednesday.
The personnel includes military police, medical personnel and engineers.
Thousands of mostly Central American migrants have made the dangerous trek through Mexico to the U.S. border since October, stoking Trump's ire.
The Trump administration announced a policy on Dec. 20 that the United States will return non-Mexican migrants who cross the border back to Mexico while their asylum requests are processed.
""These migrants face many risks,"" including organized crime, corrupt local police and hostility from local residents, said Alberto Xicotencatl, who runs a shelter in the Coahuila state capital of Saltillo, about 250 miles (400 km) south of Piedras Negras.
Earlier this week, Coahuila Governor Miguel Angel Riquelme said he would not permit the caravan migrants to cross his state, but he did not detail any specific measures.

Hundreds of migrants from the first caravan remain stuck in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, many waiting their turn to legally enter and formally request asylum in the United States.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week he would not renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH), accusing the observers of unspecified anti-Israel activity.
Norway, which has headed the multi-country observer mission for the past 22 years, said: “The one-sided Israeli decision can mean that the implementation of an important part of the Oslo accords is discontinued.” 
The 15-member U.N. Security Council discussed Israel’s decision behind closed doors on Wednesday at the request of Kuwait and Indonesia, which also drafted the statement. Such a statement has to be agreed by consensus. 
U.N. diplomats said the United States did not believe a council statement on the issue was appropriate. 
The draft statement, seen by Reuters, would have also recognized the importance of the TIPH and its “efforts to foster calm in a highly sensitive area and fragile situation on the ground, which risks further deteriorating.”
The United States has long accused the United Nations of anti-Israel bias and shields its ally from Security Council action. 
Hebron, a Palestinian city of 200,000 people, is home to a community of about 1,000 Israeli settlers who are guarded by a large Israeli military presence.
The TIPH was set up after a Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians at a Hebron shrine holy to both Muslims and Jews in 1994. The city has also seen stabbing and shooting attacks against settlers and Israeli soldiers by Palestinians.
Since Israel partially withdrew from Hebron in 1998 under interim peace deals with the self-rule Palestinian Authority, the TIPH has monitored “breaches of the agreements (and) violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” the force’s website says.
Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians collapsed in 2014. Most world powers consider Israel’s settlements in the West Bank, territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war, to be illegal. Israel disputes that, citing biblical, historical and political ties to the land.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Work to implement an agreement between Turkey and the United States over the Syrian town of Manbij has recently accelerated, Turkey's foreign minister said on Wednesday, adding that Kurdish YPG militia remained inside the town.
""The process in Manbij has sped up despite the weather conditions but the road map should have been completed by now and the reason it hasn't been is the United States,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a press conference in Washington.
Cavusoglu said apart from the joint patrols in the city, Turkey has begun working with the United States in identifying who will run Manbij and who could be within the security units of the town once Kurdish militia YPG has withdrawn from the area.
After months of disagreement, Ankara and Washington agreed in June on a roadmap that would see the YPG removed from the town. Turkey has repeatedly expressed its frustration that the implementation of the plan has been delayed.
""The U.S. administration also wants the roadmap to be implemented as soon as possible,"" Cavusoglu said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey would only wait a few weeks for militants to be removed from the north Syrian town of Manbij. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is spearheaded by the YPG, has controlled Manbij since 2016.
Cavusoglu was in the U.S. capital to attend a gathering of 79 countries partnering with the United States against Islamic State. He said there was still little clarity on the details of a U.S. withdrawal from Syria and the creation of a safe zone in the northeastern part of the country.
""No concrete ideas on the safe zone has emerged yet. We are discussing this with Russians as well and trying to coordinate it with the Americans,"" he said.
In December, Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring that Islamic State had been defeated there.
Turkey wants to set up the safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia. Cavusoglu repeated the safe zone could not be an area that would give protection to the group. 
""It is important what we understand from a safe zone. If what is understood or desired is a buffer zone that will protect the terrorists, we are against it,"" he said.
Cavusoglu also said a 'task force' group was set up between the United States and Turkey specifically to focus on the work linked to U.S. withdrawal from Syria. ""We have put in place this mechanism to ensure this process is carried out in coordination and without problems,"" he said.

The man, named by authorities as Yi Zheng, 28, pleaded guilty to the offence in a Sydney court on Thursday, the Australian Associated Press reported.
New South Wales state police said they began investigating the breach after AMP's cybersecurity staff noticed suspicious activity on the company network in December.
The investigation led them to Yi, who had downloaded 23 identity-related documents belonging to 20 customers and sent them to his personal email account, police said.
Yi was arrested as he tried to board a flight to China on Jan. 17, police said, adding that they seized mobile phones, SIM cards, a laptop, and other electronic storage devices from his luggage.
He was charged ""with possess identity info to commit indictable offence"", police said, without saying what the man planned to do with the customer information.
""Identity information is an extremely valuable commodity on the black market and dark web, and anyone – whether an individual or business – who stores this data needs to ensure it is protected,"" New South Wales Cybercrime Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Matt Craft, said in a statement.
An AMP spokeswoman said the data breach involved a small amount of customer information and there was no evidence the data was further compromised.
The company had contacted all affected customers, put extra security controls in place for those customers, and notified the relevant regulators.

Yi's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 08:02PM ET</span>","Colony or not, we're British, say Gibraltarians. And keep the border open","GIBRALTAR (Reuters) - With London fuming over whether Gibraltar should still be called a ""colony"", residents of the British outpost on the southern tip of Spain said they were more worried about life after Brexit than about which word best explained their status.
In the latest Brexit quarrel between Britain and the European Union, Her Majesty's Government complained last week that the peninsula of 33,000 residents should not have been described as a ""colony"" in a draft EU text on visa-free travel.
Britain itself called Gibraltar a ""crown colony"" for 268 years -- from when it won it in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht that ended the War of Spanish Succession, right up until 1981 when it came up with a new name for it: ""dependent territory"". In 2002, the official term changed again to ""British overseas territory"".
Until at least the 1980s, Gibraltarians carried passports that said ""Colony of Gibraltar"" right on the front cover. No matter.
""Gibraltar is not a colony and it is completely inappropriate to describe it in this way,"" Britain's ambassador to the EU thundered. ""Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family."" 
Gibraltarians, whose economy depends on an open border with Spain, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU in Britain's 2016 referendum, but are due to leave the bloc anyway on March 29 along with the rest of Britain.
Their cultural Britishness was in full evidence on Wednesday, when the city on a rock rang out with a 21-gun salute in honor of the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession.
Teacher Steven Grant did not seem much fussed about the terminology, provided that the border stays open.
""We're still connected to them, maybe as a colony used to be, but we're not governed by them,"" he said of Britain.
""We just want to stay as we are, British. We don't need anything to change. All we hope is that things on the frontier don't change either.""
But others on the central shopping street shared London's official umbrage at the EU's choice of vocabulary.

""This isn't the 1700s ... it's 2019 and we're a city, we're Gibraltar, we're not a colony,"" said insurance salesman Jack Johnson.

Bashir's remarks appeared to be part of a new strategy to soften the government's stance toward the protests after the Defence Minister and Prime Minister made similar remarks in recent days.
""Most of the protesters are young and there are factors that drove them to take to the streets, including inflation, which led to higher prices - and the limited job opportunities that don't match the number of graduates,"" Bashir told journalists invited to the presidential palace for a ""discussion of recent events"". 
The remarks are a dramatic contrast to Bashir's previous demand for the ""rats to go back to their holes"".
Bashir warned against destabilizing the Sudanese state, however, saying ""you can look at what happened in Libya,"" which has been in a state of turmoil since a 2011 civil war led to the overthrow of longstanding ruler Muammar Gaddafi. 
The protests, which started on Dec. 19, were triggered by price increases, limits on cash withdrawals and other economic hardships but have since shifted focus to Bashir's 30-year rule.
Police officers have used teargas and occasionally live bullets to disperse the demonstrations. Human rights activists say at least 45 have been killed. The government puts the death toll at 30, including two security personnel. Political activists, civil society members and journalists have been detained. 
Bashir said all journalists who have been jailed in connection with the protests would be released. Activists estimate the number of journalists in prison at 16.
He also said young people's anger was fueled by the ""wrong implementation"" of Sudan's public order laws. The morality laws have been criticized by human rights organizations for restricting the freedom of women by, for example, making it a crime for a woman to wear trousers.
Defence Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf said on Monday young people caught up in the protests had ""reasonable ambition"". On Saturday, Prime Minister Moataz Moussa described calls for better living conditions as ""legitimate"". 
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region, which he denies. He has been lobbying to be removed from a list of countries that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism.
The listing has blocked the investment and financial aid that Sudan was hoping for when the United States lifted sanctions in 2017, economists say.

Sudan has been rapidly expanding its money supply in an attempt to finance its budget deficit, causing spiraling inflation and a steep decline in the value of its currency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, days from formally launching her 2020 presidential campaign, faced criticism on Wednesday for claiming she was Native American in the 1980s and concern from fellow Democrats over her handling of the issue.
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the Massachusetts Democrat described herself as Native American in a form to join the Texas legal bar in the 1980s, the latest twist in the six-year saga during which she has been unable to quiet critics who say she failed to recognize the importance of tribal sovereignty.
Fellow 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls remained quiet, while others in the party worried the controversy could cause her campaign to falter even before she formally announces on Saturday.
""They mishandled it from the minute that she was presented with evidence that she isn’t Native American,"" said Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist in Boston. 
This week's news about Warren comes as Democrats grapple with accusations of racial insensitivity after the Democratic governor and attorney general in Virginia admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s.
One Warren financial backer, who asked to speak anonymously, said those revelations complicated Warren's political viability but should not doom her. 
""I think her policies are strong enough - her honesty or her devotion to making things better - that it overcomes any issues, any doubts that this might raise in my mind about her,"" the donor said. 
Warren told reporters in Washington on Wednesday she did not believe her identification as Native American ever helped her get ahead. She said her recent apologies were a recognition that she should have been more aware of how she was identifying.
""I'm not a tribal citizen, and I should have been more mindful,"" Warren said.
Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican Party, asked the Texas bar association to discipline Warren for presenting herself as Native American, which she said was a “false statement.”  
Senator Kamala Harris, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge President Donald Trump, told the Washington Post the debate was a ""distraction.""
Warren's heritage claims have dogged her since her first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2012, when Republican Scott Brown attacked her for being listed by Harvard University as a minority when she was a member of the faculty.
After Warren criticized Trump ahead of his 2016 campaign, he nicknamed her ""Pocahontas,"" despite criticism he was being racially insensitive.
Last year, after Trump offered to pay her $1 million if she took a DNA test, Warren released results of an examination of her genetics. That angered tribal leaders who said being a Native American is not determined by DNA alone but by membership in a tribe.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will call on the European Union on Thursday to work with her to change a divorce deal and help her win the support of a divided parliament to smooth Britain's departure from the bloc.
Before arriving in Brussels for talks with EU leaders, May acknowledged that her task - to force change to a deal agreed almost three months ago - would not be easy, and a government source said a breakthrough on Thursday was not expected.
But she will tell European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and the European parliament's Antonio Tajani she wants to work ""urgently"" with them to secure changes that she argues can win over not only her fractious Conservative Party but lawmakers across parliament.
Just weeks after parliament resoundingly rejected her Brexit deal, May needs to persuade a reluctant EU to change the Withdrawal Agreement to help her get lawmakers' approval before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. 
If she cannot, Britain, and May, face an uncertain future, opening the door to several scenarios - leaving without a deal which some businesses say might cripple the economy, another referendum, an early election or never leaving the EU at all.
Acknowledging that the agreement ""was the product of much hard work and was negotiated in good faith"", May will tell the leaders that parliament had sent ""an unequivocal message that change is required"", according to her office.
""The government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes ... We must show determination and do what it takes to now get the deal over the line.""
The main stumbling block to winning approval is the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy that there will be no return of the checks at the border with EU member Ireland that in the past were a focus for sectarian violence.
Some lawmakers want her to remove the provision entirely, while others say they will accept legally-binding assurances that it would not lead to Britain being trapped in the EU's sphere indefinitely or a way for London to end it unilaterally.
But the EU, and particularly Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, say they will not re-open the agreement, underlining that the political instability in Britain only further proved the need for the backstop.
Frustration with Britain boiled over on Wednesday when Tusk openly wondered what ""that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely"".

But even though both sides say they do not want Britain to leave without a deal, any breakthrough on Thursday is unlikely. May described the meetings in Brussels ""as part of a process leading to the government bringing back"" a new vote on a Brexit deal as soon as possible.

(Reuters) - Jury deliberations in the U.S. trial of accused Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman were expected to stretch into a fourth day after jurors asked to review days' worth of testimony from key prosecution witnesses.
Guzman, 61, is accused of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. He twice escaped from prison in Mexico; if convicted, he will face a U.S. prison sentence of up to life.
The 11-week trial in federal court in Brooklyn, in which more than 50 witnesses testified, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named for the state in northwestern Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.
The defense has argued Guzman was set up as a ""fall guy"" by Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a Sinaloan drug kingpin who remains at large.
On Wednesday afternoon, jurors asked to review the testimony of Zambada's brother, Jesus ""El Rey"" Zambada, and son, Vicente Zambada, as well as of Guzman's former top lieutenant, Damaso Lopez. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan told them they would get transcripts of the testimony as soon as they were ready.
The three witnesses pleaded guilty to U.S. charges and agreed to testify against Guzman. All of them spoke at length about Guzman's alleged drug trafficking.
The jurors also asked whether the killing of drug cartel members by members of a rival cartel for personal reasons counted as a ""drug trafficking crime.""
One of the 10 criminal counts against Guzman, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, includes the charge that he conspired to murder cartel enemies. The jury gave no indication of whether their question related to any particular murder.
Cogan instructed the jurors that if a drug cartel member was murdered for ""wholly personal"" reasons unrelated to drug trafficking, it was not a drug trafficking crime.
The 12 jurors appeared relaxed and even cheerful as they entered the courtroom to receive Cogan's instructions.
They had already asked on Tuesday to review the testimony of two other witnesses who were cooperating with prosecutors, Colombian drug traffickers Jorge and Alex Cifuentes, as well as part of Jesus Zambada's testimony about manufacturing methamphetamine.

The jurors left court around 4:15 p.m. EST on Wednesday, and were expected to return at about 9:30 a.m. on Thursday. They began deliberating early Monday afternoon.

    The strikes, which started on Sunday, come as Chadian rebels have increased their activities in southern Libya since vowing last year to overthrow President Idriss Deby. The strikes were also held on Tuesday but not Monday.
    The Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a rebel Chadian coalition created in 2009 after almost toppling Deby, has said it was behind this week's incursion, which saw some 50 pick-up trucks drive 400 km (250 miles) into Chadian territory. 
    ""The incursion of this armed column deep into Chadian territory was aimed at destabilizing this country,"" the French military said in a statement.
The strikes by Mirage fighter jets were carried out in response to a formal request for assistance by a sovereign state and were conducted according to international humanitarian law, it said. The planes took off from the Chadian capital N'Djamena and were supported by a Reaper drone, the statement said.
    A UFR official told Reuters on Monday two of its fighters had been killed. 
Deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in 1990 in a military coup. International observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office since and last year he pushed through constitutional reforms that could keep him in office until 2033.
    France intervened in 2008 to stop the UFR toppling Deby, but President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants a new relationship with France's former colonies and the era of propping up leaders is over.
    However, France considers Chad as crucial given it is deemed as having the most battled-hardened troops in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa. Paris has based its 4,500-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force in N'Djamena, where the United States also has a base.
The ""Chadian army is an essential partner in the fight against terrorism in Mali ... the G5 force and its action against Boko Haram"", the French military statement said. 

    Chadian air strikes had initially attempted to destroy the rebel convoy on Feb. 1-2. Deby's fight against Islamist militants in the region has strained his military and hit the oil-dependent economy, leading to growing dissatisfaction in one of the world's poorest nations.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>","Blackface, sex assault scandals shake top Virginia Democrats","By Gary Robertson
RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginia's attorney general on Wednesday admitted he wore blackface at a college party, becoming the state's third high-ranking Democrat caught up in scandal since the release of a racist photo from Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook.
Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement that he donned brown face paint at a party in 1980 to impersonate a rapper. Northam admitted last weekend to having worn blackface - a practice that dates to 19th century minstrel shows caricaturing slaves - in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson.
U.S. Democrats have become increasingly focused on promoting diversity and rooting out patterns of sexual misconduct in many American institutions. In that context, Northam's admission sparked immediate calls for his resignation from fellow Virginia Democrats and national political figures, including at least five 2020 White House candidates.
A separate scandal relating to Democratic Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who is black and would succeed Northam were he to step down, intensified on Wednesday when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.
The woman, Vanessa Tyson, in a statement issued by Washington law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks said that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room at the time.
""I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,"" Tyson said in the statement, which was published by multiple U.S. media outlets. The law firm did not immediately respond to a request for a copy of the statement.
A conservative website first reported Tyson's allegations on Monday.
Fairfax maintained in a statement on Wednesday that incident was consensual.
""I wish her no harm or humiliation, nor do I seek to denigrate her or diminish her voice,"" Fairfax said in a statement on Wednesday. ""But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true.""
Elected officials in both parties have recently seen their careers ended by allegations of racism and sexual misconduct.
Florida's Republican secretary of state last month resigned after a newspaper published a photo of him wearing blackface at a 2005 costume party.
Democratic U.S. Senator Al Franken resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct.
Herring, who like Northam is white and is second in line to succeed the governor after Fairfax, had last week called for Northam to resign.
Herring said in a statement on Wednesday he now realized he showed poor judgment by dressing as a rapper and donning a wig and brown makeup to perform a song with similarly attired friends.
""I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others,"" he said.
'STILL PROCESSING IT'
The days of allegations rattled the Democratic leadership of Virginia, a key swing state that will be a major focus in the 2020 presidential campaign.
""I'm still processing it myself,"" Monique Alcala, the president of the state party's Latino caucus, said in a telephone interview. She said Democrats would end up calling for Herring to resign too.
Lawmakers largely ducked reporters as they left the state capitol in Richmond following Wednesday's legislative session.
Northam on Friday apologized and said he was one of the people in the photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook that depicted a person in blackface makeup standing beside another person garbed in white robes of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan.
He changed his story a day later, saying neither figure in the picture was him but acknowledging he had dressed in blackface to portray pop star Michael Jackson.
The origins of blackface date to 19th-century ""minstrel"" shows in which white performers covered their faces in black grease paint to caricature slaves. Blackface remained a trope of Hollywood entertainment into the mid-1980s, including comic movie ""Soul Man"" featuring a protagonist who posed as black to get into an Ivy League college.

After Fairfax, 39, and Herring, 57, the next in the line of succession for the governorship is state House speaker Kirk Cox, a Republican.

Homicides rose by one-third last year, breaking a record for the second consecutive year and underscoring the challenge facing Mexico's new president to rein in the violence that has spiraled over the last decade amid a military-led war on drug trafficking. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, has proposed bolstering the armed forces through a new National Guard, while saying the war against drug traffickers is over. He is also exploring a crop substitution for illicit crops and amnesties for low level drug dealers and farmers.
The government will initially deploy 600 people to each of the 17 targeted districts and subsequently expand the program to other areas of the country, Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo told a press conference.
The northern border city of Tijuana, which had one of the country's highest murder tallies in December with 202 deaths, began receiving new forces on Monday. Fellow U.S. border cities of Ciudad Juarez, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo are also slated for an influx of troops, along with tourist beach destination of Acapulco.
The deployments are intended to be permanent, Durazo said. 

""It's one thing to do operations and bring forces from Mexico City to Tijuana, to Reynosa, to Nuevo Laredo, and then bring them back,"" Durazo said. ""It's very different to have a permanent state of force.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition is opening a U.S. fund to receive the proceeds of oil sales, a key measure to secure revenue for its effort to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro, an opposition lawmaker said on Wednesday.
The fund would receive income accrued by state-run oil firm PDVSA's U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum Corp since last month, when U.S. President Donald Trump recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, Carlos Paparoni said in an interview.
""This is already quite advanced, I hope that next week it can be announced by our representative in the United States,"" Paparoni said, in reference to Venezuelan opposition envoy Carlos Vecchio.
Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela's top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug of war as the Trump administration has made aggressive moves to remove it from Maduro's control.
Following a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry last week, Guaido and the Trump administration have sought to appoint a new board of directors for Citgo. PDVSA has said it would take legal action to block a takeover.
About a dozen tankers carrying over 7 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and products were anchored this week at the U.S Gulf Coast waiting for directions on how to pay for the cargoes following the sanctions, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation, with the United States and a growing number of other nations recognizing Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president.
Yon Goicoechea, a member of Guaido's policy team, told Reuters that Guaido was in contact with PDVSA's international partners and they were willing to keep operating in Venezuela.
He did not identify the partners.
Guaido's team is planning for a post-Maduro government with an emergency scheme to supply fuel domestically, given widespread shortages across Venezuela, Goicoechea said.

Maduro, who retains control over the state, denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him.

Fifty lawmakers from Macron's Republic On The Move (LREM) abstained in the vote at the lower house National Assembly on Tuesday, the highest number of abstentions since Macron's election in 2017. 
Although the bill passed thanks to Macron's comfortable majority, the abstentions were a sign of growing unease over the government's lurch to the right in response to three months of protests by the grassroots ""yellow vest"" movement.
Matthieu Orphelin, a former Green party member who abstained, told his LREM colleagues he would leave the party, LREM told Reuters, without giving a reason for the departure.
The presidential party is now down to 306 lawmakers at the lower house, but still above the 289 lawmakers needed for an outright majority. Four others have left or been expelled from the party since 2017.
The ""anti-casseurs"" (anti-hooligan) law bans protesters from hiding their faces, gives police greater powers to extract potential trouble-makers from demonstrations, and grants local authorities the right to ban individual protesters.
It was criticized by center-left opposition leaders as an attack on civil liberties and the right to protest.
France's interior minister said earlier on Wednesday the government was willing to listen to reservations from MPs ahead of a second reading at the upper house Senate, but denied the bill impinged on civil liberties. 
Rioters ran amok in Paris during the early street protests, torching cars, smashing luxury boutiques and defacing the Arc de Triomphe.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",Engine trouble: EU struggles to attune diplomacy in Brussels,"By Robin Emmott and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The rise to power of anti-EU populists in some member states is making it harder for the European Union to agree common statements on fast-moving foreign crises, diplomats say, raising a threat to the bloc's prized ""soft power"" status. 
By the end of a foreign ministers meeting on Monday, EU states had failed to agree no less than three foreign policy statements -- on Venezuela, Arab ties and Russian violations of a missile treaty -- despite days of negotiations.
While a statement on Iran did finally win approval, it was repeatedly held up in the preceding weeks over the wording of a single paragraph.
""We do have trouble in the engine room,"" one EU envoy said. 
Reaching a joint position among 28 member countries has never been easy but is considered the backbone of the economically powerful EU's diplomatic successes. These have included cementing pro-democracy revolutions in Ukraine and Tunisia and mediating a landmark Iran nuclear accord.
Despite the energetic public profile of the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, attempts to agree a position on areas ranging from the South China Sea dispute to Israel and the Palestinians have unraveled at the last minute.
Such divisions have also hampered the EU from quickly imposing economic sanctions for rights abuses, as the United States often does, diplomats say. 
The approach of European Parliament elections in May could be worsening the situation, as mainstream political parties take more strident positions in Brussels that play well at home, a second diplomat said.
""We work Friday night, throughout the weekend, have endless sessions on these documents and then, on Monday night, someone still comes in and vetoes,"" added a third diplomat. 
MAJORITY-VOTING, OR RED BULL? 
With Britain distracted by its planned exit from the European Union next month and populists in power in Italy, the Franco-German alliance that has underpinned EU integration is not always enough.
Diplomats say fraying unity in the wider European Union means difficulties are becoming more evident and the consequences more public, regardless of the geopolitical issue the bloc wants to help resolve.
Despite European Parliament support for recognizing Venezuela's self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, Italy blocked a Swedish compromise to acknowledge him as such, fearful of angering Russia, which backs President Nicholas Maduro.
But when it came to calling out Moscow for violating the Cold War-era INF arms control treaty, as NATO has done, Cyprus blocked, along with Greece. Athens did the same at the United Nations in 2017 when the EU tried to criticize China's human rights record. 
Hungary, along with Italy a fierce critic of European immigration policy, has also emerged as an obstacle. Budapest shunned on Monday a joint declaration with the League of Arab States because an initial draft referenced a U.N. migration pact that Hungary has rejected. 
""The EU-Arab ministerial was weeks of preparations and Hungary's position just does not make sense. The INF treaty was about NATO versus non-NATO countries. The Italian government is chaos. These examples show how everybody is pulling their own way increasingly,"" a senior EU diplomat said.
Diplomats say Poland's right-wing ruling party is against anything that might imply criticism of the United States, its de facto protector against Russia through NATO. 
Even pro-European Spain has become embroiled in internal disputes when it has felt excluded from diplomatic initiatives, such as one to convince Tehran to help end the war in Yemen.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year proposed majority-voting on foreign policy, which would help political unity on human rights and make it easier to impose sanctions and take decisions on overseas crisis missions.
But that would need EU governments to give up their vetoes.
Many diplomats say they will continue trying for consensus.

Gathered in the early morning at the red marble-clad European Council on Monday after a weekend of negotiations on Venezuela, one exhausted envoy's solution was ""more Red Bull"".

ROME (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido has asked Italy's ruling coalition leaders to meet with representatives as he seeks their explicit backing as interim president alongside almost all other European countries. 
The hard-right League has expressed strong support for Guaido, but coalition partner the 5-Star Movement has not, making Italy the only major European Union nation not to recognize him as Venezuela's temporary head of state.
In a Feb. 5 letter distributed by League leader and deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini's office on Wednesday, Guaido asks if he can send a delegation ""to illustrate the plan of action to renew democracy in Venezuela"" through fair elections.
""The current humanitarian crisis is hitting all Venezuelans, including the more than 100,000 Italians who live in Venezuela,"" it said. A 5-Star government source said its leader Luigi Di Maio had received a similar letter.
Salvini's office said he would meet Guaido's envoys on Feb. 11. There was no immediate comment from 5-Star.
About 20 European Union nations including Britain, Germany, France and Spain have aligned with the United States in recognizing Guaido's leadership and pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to call a new election.
Russia and China object to outside interference. 
""Maduro is a criminal, Maduro is an outlaw, Maduro is an abusive, fallen and expired president,"" Salvini said on Tuesday. ""There is an illegal president who is torturing, arresting, starving and massacring (people) and there is a community that has the right to vote freely.""
Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent 5-Star figure, has said overt support for Guaido would be meddling and could open the way for military intervention. 
Italy on Monday blocked a joint EU position to recognize Guaido as interim president, diplomatic sources said.
Venezuelans of Italian origin, many arriving in the first half of the 20th century when southern Europe was in economic doldrums from the two World Wars, are a large and influential group in the South American country.
Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who plays a mainly ceremonial role and usually stays out of day-to-day politics, urged the government to overcome differences and back Guaido. 
""We must demonstrate responsibility and clarity with a common line taken by all our EU partners and allies,"" Mattarella said at an event in Rome on Monday.

Mainstream center-left and center-right parties have denounced the government for being out of step with Europe.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 11:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Heavily indebted Lebanon promises quick reforms - draft policy statement,"By Laila Bassam and Tom Perry
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is committed to launching fast and effective reforms that could be ""difficult and painful"" to avoid a worsening of economic, financial and social conditions, according to a draft government policy statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The statement sets the main policy objectives of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's national unity government that was finally formed last week after nine months of wrangling over cabinet portfolios.
With one of the world's highest public debt burdens, Lebanon says it will carry out reforms that have been put off for years but are now seen as more pressing than ever to put the public finances on a sustainable path.
The draft policy statement commits to bringing down the debt-to-GDP ratio by boosting the size of the economy and reducing the budget deficit.
Echoing a pledge made by Hariri at last year's Paris donor conference, it says the government is committed to a ""financial correction"" equal to at least one percent of GDP a year over five years, starting with the 2019 budget.
This would be achieved by boosting revenues and cutting spending, starting with transfers to the state-run power company, which the World Bank has said represent a ""staggering burden"" on the public finances.
The draft statement also said the government would freeze state hiring in 2019 in all its forms.
State hiring in the four years to follow would be half the number of retirees and only on condition the deficit reduction targets had been met.
Information Minister Jamal al-Jarrah, speaking to journalists, said tax increases were not being considered.
He said there were no big points of contention over the statement and it was expected to be approved on Thursday by the government, which includes the Iran-backed group Hezbollah.
International donor institutions and foreign governments want to see reforms before releasing some $11 billion in financial assistance pledged at a Paris conference last year.
Hariri aims to use the funds, mostly soft loans, for a capital investment programme that would boost low growth. Lebanon's economy has been hit by factors including years of regional turmoil, including the war in Syria.
The draft policy statement said the government would continue the policy of exchange rate stability, calling it a priority for ""social and economic stability"". The pound has been pegged to the dollar at the same level for over two decades.
AOUN SAYS FINANCIAL SITUATION IMPROVING
The government would award licences for offshore energy blocks in a second round of tenders by the end of 2019, the draft statement said.
Exploration in the first block by a consortium of France's Total, Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek began last year. 
Lebanon has some of the world's worst debt and balance-of-payments ratios, and its ability to dodge financial disaster has for years confounded critics, whose warnings of debt defaults, balance of payments crises and a collapse of the pound currency, have all failed to materialise.
Its financial system has depended for funding on financial transfers from the diaspora, though questions over the sustainability of the model have grown due to a slowdown in remittance and deposit inflows.
President Michel Aoun said the financial situation was improving. Aoun also said that interest rates were expected to start falling soon. A presidential source said he was referring to high rates offered on bank deposits.
Kevin Daly, Senior Investment Manager in Emerging Market Debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said it clearly looked ""like an unsustainable story over the medium term"".

""Having a government in place, that's extremely important, but they need to address some of the key vulnerabilities and the big one is in the electricity sector which is a big drain on the fiscal finance of the country – that plus no growth.""

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition on Wednesday snubbed talks with President Emmerson Mnangagwa meant to try resolve a political and economic crisis, saying any dialogue with the president must be brokered by an independent outside mediator.
Mnangagwa, who is under pressure over the deteriorating economy and a crackdown on anti-government protests last month, invited 23 opposition leaders to a meeting to draw up terms for national dialogue.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said it would take part in the talks only if they were held under the supervision of the United Nations, African Union or regional bloc Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community. 
""The MDC's position is that the dialogue process must be convened by an independent mediator and not one of the disputants,"" the MDC said in a letter responding to Mnangagwa's invitation to the talks.
The MDC has said Zimbabwe's problems stemmed from last year's presidential vote. Mnangagwa won but MDC accused his side of rigging the results, which he denies.
Joice Mujuru, an opposition leader and former vice president to Robert Mugabe, also did not attend the meeting although other smaller parties met Mnangagwa at state house offices in Harare.
In a speech before the talks, Mnangagwa said his opponents should accept his election win, and he urged them to call for the removal of U.S. sanctions on ruling party and government officials.
""Peace can never be imposed from outside but must issue from within our own society,"" Mnangagwa said, in an apparent reference to the MDC demand for an outside mediator.
Zimbabwe has held disputed elections since 2000, which coincided with an economic recession, but in 2009 the ruling ZANU-PF party and the MDC formed a unity government, which ushered economic and political stability.
Last July's vote, the first since Mugabe was forced to resign after a coup in 2017, was seen as an opportunity to pull Zimbabwe out of its diplomatic isolation and prompting an economic recovery. Instead, the vote left the nation polarised.
Rights groups and witnesses say armed men in police and army uniform have continued to make night raids at homes of opposition activists where they beat up occupants, a charge denied by security forces.
A video surfaced this week of a soldier beating women at a house in a Harare township while another man held a pistol and frogmarched three young men.
Army's Major General Nyikayaramba told reporters that the army used proportionate force against protesters and that no one had reported rights abuses against the military.
The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO forum said on Wednesday that 17 people had died since the mid-January protests although police still insist three people were killed.

In Harare, a strike for better pay by public sector teachers entered its second day as some stayed at home while others attended school but did not teach, with unions accusing security agents of intimidation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will make no new offer on Brexit and those who promoted Britain's exit without any understanding of how to deliver it deserve a ""special place in hell"", European Council President Donald Tusk said on Wednesday.
The United Kingdom is on course to leave the EU on March 29 without a deal unless Prime Minister Theresa May can convince the bloc to reopen the divorce agreement she reached in November and then sell it to skeptical British lawmakers.
But as Tusk's pointedly blunt language showed, frustration runs deep among European leaders over the British parliament's rejection of the divorce deal and May's demands that the EU now give up on key principles or face disruption in just 50 days.
As companies and governments across Europe step up preparations for a disorderly no-deal exit, diplomats and officials said Britain now faces three main options: a no-deal exit, a last-minute deal or a delay to Brexit.
Rebuffing May's bid to renegotiate just a day before she is due in Brussels, Tusk said he had abandoned the hope he has often expressed that Britain's exit might be stopped and said his priority was now to avert a ""fiasco"" when it leaves.
""I've been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely,"" Tusk said at a joint news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.
The remark by Tusk, who chairs summits of the EU's national leaders, angered Brexit supporters in Britain.
Veteran Brexiteer Nigel Farage retorted: ""After Brexit we will be free of unelected, arrogant bullies like you - sounds like heaven to me.""
While Tusk was clear the EU would not reopen the divorce deal, he also said he still believed a common Brexit solution was possible.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker rammed home Tusk's message, saying the legal withdrawal agreement would not be reopened, and May knew that.
Varadkar said Britain's political instability further proved the need for a ""backstop"" insurance policy - the main obstacle to a deal - to keep the border between EU member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland open after Brexit.
May will visit Dublin on Friday, Varadkar said.
For May, failure to deliver a revised deal would shatter the fragile unity in her Conservative Party, leaving her already-diminished authority in tatters, and ramping up uncertainty in financial markets over the fate of the British economy, the world's fifth largest.
Rating agency Standard and Poor's said a no-deal Brexit could result in negative revisions of their outlooks on Britain's credit ratings, but that there remained a very strong incentive for both sides to reach a deal. 
IRISH UNITY?
In another stark indication of the stakes for Britain of a disorderly Brexit, Irish nationalists warned May that if she allowed a no-deal Brexit then there would have to be a referendum on Irish unity.
""In the event of a crash... she must as a democrat return to the Good Friday Agreement and she must begin preparation for a referendum on Irish unity,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said, referring to the peace accord signed in 1998 that ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
The United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU has strained ties between its constituent parts: England and Wales voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. 
May has said she will seek an alternative arrangement which avoids the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland, or legally binding changes to the backstop to introduce a time limit or create an exit mechanism.
Brexit has snagged on the 310-mile (500-km) frontier because there is disagreement on how to monitor trade without physical checks on the border, which was marked by military checkpoints before the Good Friday peace agreement.
Under the divorce deal agreed in November, the 'backstop' would come into effect if the two sides failed to come up with a better idea to keep the border open.
ALTERNATIVE IDEAS
But the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May's government says it could endanger the province's place in the United Kingdom, while Brexit supporters in May's Conservative Party worry it locks the country into EU rules.
At a meeting in Belfast on Thursday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told May the backstop needed to be replaced, but said their discussion had been useful.
The Sun newspaper said British ministers were examining a plan drawn up by Japan's Fujitsu to track trade across the border. The Telegraph said ministers had discussed delaying Brexit by eight weeks.
EU officials are asking May to embrace a proposal by the opposition Labour Party to join a permanent customs union with the bloc. 
Such a move could remove the need for the backstop and, some in the EU believe, may win approval in Britain's parliament. But officials have low expectations ahead of the prime minister's visit to Brussels on Thursday. 

""Theresa May is not delivering on what she agreed with us,"" a senior EU diplomat said. ""Her inability to build a cross-party agreement is staggering.""

Doctors treating two-week-old Abd al-Khaleq and Abd al-Rahim said Yemen's war-ravaged health system cannot keep them alive, and the parents are poor. 
""They need to travel immediately. They will not be able to survive in Yemen under the social, political and economic circumstances in this country,"" Doctor Faisal al-Balbali told Reuters in al-Thawra hospital in the capital Sanaa where the boys were born. 
The tiny boys, who are being helped to breathe in an incubator, have separate heads. 
Within their shared torso they have separate spines, lungs, hearts and digestive systems, but they share a liver, reproductive organs and pair of kidneys, arms and legs between them.
""Even if one is unwell, the other is fine ... They are different in every aspect,"" al-Balbali said. 
The doctors are appealing to the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations to arrange for the boys' transfer abroad. 
Their parents were not present when the doctors were speaking about their sons, but medical staff said they had agreed with them to invite the media to highlight their plight.
Al-Balbali, head of the neonatal unit, said medics were not able to perform even basic diagnostic tests such as an MRI scan in Yemen, and certainly did not have the capabilities to separate them, if needed. 
""This is a rare case,"" said Doctor Abd al-Hakim Abu Taleb, the hospital's general manager, who is writing up a report about their birth for doctors worldwide to study. 
He said hospitals in Yemen have seen an increase in birth defects in recent years, something he said could be down to war conditions causing poor nutrition and lack of medicines.
Yemen's almost four-year war pits the Iran-aligned Houthi movement against a Saudi-backed coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, collapsed the economy and brought millions of people to the brink of famine.
Sanaa, where the boys were born in what the doctors said was a ""complicated"" birth for the mother, is under Houthi control. 

The airport has been closed to civilian flights since 2015 because the Saudi-led coalition has control over Yemeni airspace. Only U.N. planes can land there currently and re-opening the airport is a key aim of U.N.-led peace talks which began with negotiations in Stockholm in December.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Massachusetts manslaughter conviction upheld in teen texting suicide case,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top court on Wednesday upheld the manslaughter conviction of a woman accused of goading her teenage boyfriend into committing suicide in 2014 with text messages and phone calls, in a case that drew national attention to cyber-bullying.
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court agreed with a lower court's 2017 ruling on Michelle Carter, who prosecutors said urged her 18-year-old boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself in a parking lot about 60 miles (100 km) south of Boston.
The case, the first in the state to consider manslaughter charges tied to texting, raised concerns among civil liberties advocates who said Carter was being prosecuted for her speech.
But Justice Scott Kafker said the evidence supported a finding that Carter, then 17, ""badgered"" Roy by phone to get back into a carbon-monoxide filled truck he had stepped out of, after ""constantly pressuring"" him in text messages to commit suicide.
""The evidence against the defendant proved that, by her wanton or reckless conduct, she caused the victim's death by suicide,"" Kafker wrote for the unanimous seven-member court.
He rejected arguments by Carter, now 22, that her conviction violated her free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution, saying the court was not punishing her for her words alone, but for ""reckless or wanton words causing death.""
Daniel Marx, Carter's lawyer, in a statement called the decision disappointing and said he was considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Roy killed himself on July 12, 2014, by filling his parked truck in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, with carbon monoxide from a generator he had hooked up to it.
Prosecutors at trial presented evidence showing that Roy briefly left the vehicle after he began to be overwhelmed by the fumes, but returned after Carter, who spoke with him by phone, urged him to ""get back in.""
That instruction was captured in a text message Carter sent to a friend. She had, in earlier text messages, encouraged Roy to ""promise"" to kill himself and helped him plan the event after he abandoned earlier suicide attempts.
Carter, of Plainville, Massachusetts, was indicted in 2015. She opted against a jury trial, leaving her fate in the hands of Bristol County Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz, who found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter in June 2017.
Moniz subsequently ordered her to serve 15 months of a 2 1/2-year sentence in prison. Her sentence was on hold while she appealed.

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan and would be able to reduce U.S. troops there as negotiations advanced to end America's longest war.
U.S. and Taliban delegations met in Qatar in January and are due to meet again this month. 
""The Americans told us (last month) that they would withdraw half of their troops from the beginning of February to the end of April,"" Taliban official Abdul Salam Hanafi was quoted as saying by RIA.
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington had ""not agreed to any timeline for a possible drawdown of troops.
""...If all parties do what is necessary to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a platform for terrorism, as conditions allow we are willing to look at changes in force presence,"" she added. 
A U.S. official said in January that more talks were needed on U.S. demands for a Taliban ceasefire before any withdrawal.
The Taliban officials were in Moscow for talks with Afghan opposition politicians, including former President Hamid Karzai - discussions the current government in Kabul has said are not in the country's best interests.
Hanafi said Washington and the Taliban had agreed at talks that all foreign troops would eventually leave, and that Afghanistan would never be used as a base for attacks on the United States.
""The timeline (of the withdrawal) will be discussed at future meetings,"" Hanafi said.

A U.S. official said in December that Trump was planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

The United Nations said the convoy of more than 100 trucks was carrying food, sanitation and hygiene supplies, and health assistance to the camp. 
""Conditions at Rukban are increasingly desperate. The vast majority of people at the site are women and children who have been staying there for more than two years in harsh conditions,"" Fadwa AbedRabou Baroud, a U.N. Damascus-based spokeswoman said.
The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) is also taking part in the convoy, which will involve an emergency vaccination campaign for 10,000 children against measles, polio and other diseases.
Rukban, located close to the Tanf U.S. military base in the desert near where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq converge, is home to between 40,000 to 50,000 people whose last U.N. aid convoy arrived in November.
In the last three years, tens of thousands of people have fled to the camp from Islamic State-held parts of Syria being targeted by Russian and U.S.-led coalition air strikes.
Rukban lies inside a ""deconfliction zone"" set up by U.S. forces. Moscow and Damascus who say U.S. troops are occupying Syrian territory and providing a safe haven for rebels have been pushing Washington to leave the area.
The U.S.-protected zone has encouraged many of Rukban's inhabitants to stay rather than go back to their homes in areas under government control where they fear retribution by the Syrian army, local officials say.
Many youths fear being dragged into the army. 
Both the United Nations and Jordan, where the camp is close to its border, says the situation is not tenable in the long run and residents should be encouraged to voluntarily leave.
Shortages of food and medicine at the desolate camp have caused dozens of deaths in the last few years, aid workers say.
""While this delivery of assistance will provide much-needed support to people at Rukban, it is only a temporary measure,"" acting U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Sajjad Malik was quoted as saying in the statement. 
A long-term solution is urgently needed, Malik said.

RAMALLAH, West Bank/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinians warmed on Wednesday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's toughest election rival, a former top general who said Israel should not maintain its dominion over them.
With both a general election and the unveiling of a U.S. peace initiative on the horizon, the centrist candidate, Benny Gantz, has been signaling an openness to territorial compromise in the occupied West Bank. That marks a contrast with the right-wing Netanyahu, who has ruled out withdrawing settlements.
The secret U.S. proposal for breaking a five-year diplomatic deadlock is widely expected to be unveiled after Israel's April 9 ballot. Pollsters see Netanyahu's conservative Likud party winning around 30 of parliament's 120 seats, setting him up for a fifth term.
In an interview on Wednesday with Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Gantz was asked about prospects for accommodation with the Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
""We need to find a way not to have dominion over other people,"" Gantz said.
Gantz, whose new Resilience party is gaining ground against Netanyahu's Likud with as many as 24 projected seats, has said he wanted to strengthen settlement blocs in the West Bank.
But he has not mentioned what might happen in any future peace deal to isolated settlements that are not incorporated into Israel if Palestinians are given a separate state.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, praised ""the signs coming from Gantz about settlements"", calling them a step in the right direction should he win the election and prove ""willing and ready"" for peace.
""It's encouraging, if he succeeds and he sticks to this opinion,"" Abu Rudeineh told Reuters.
Most world powers consider Israeli settlements on land captured in a 1967 war to be illegal under the Geneva conventions. Israel disputes this, citing historical ties to the land, and has expanded the settlement population steadily, including during the past decade under Netanyahu.
Palestinians say settlements must be removed from their future state in any final agreement, although some could be ceded to Israel as part of an agreed swap for other land. The last peace talks collapsed in 2014, in part over the issue of settlements, and Abbas is boycotting the Trump administration, accusing it of being biased toward Israel.
In a statement, Likud said Gantz was planning to form a ""leftist government"" sympathetic to the Palestinians.
Gantz' Resilience party said ""no unilateral decision will be made on settlement evacuation"" and that he would ""maintain ... non-negotiable security protections"".
Netanyahu cites the example of Gaza -- where Israel unilaterally pulled out its settlements in 2005 and the Islamist group Hamas soon took control -- as proof that removing settlements from the West Bank would be dangerous.
Gantz described the Gaza withdrawal as well executed, telling Yedioth: ""We need to take the lessons and apply them elsewhere.""

The Trump administration has wavered over whether it would endorse a Palestinian state, saying the final outcome will be up to the sides to determine, but both may need to compromise.

Flavio Bolsonaro, a newly inaugurated federal senator, has been dogged by corruption allegations that are sullying the squeaky clean, law-and-order image his father used to ride to an easy presidential election last year. 
Flavio Bolsonaro has refused to meet with prosecutors to be questioned and repeatedly dodges journalists' questions on the allegations against him. He said in a written statement that the latest accusations against him were baseless and would be tossed out.
Brazil's Supreme Court earlier this month rejected an appeal by Flavio to halt a sprawling probe into numerous suspicious cash payments made into the account of his former driver, Fabricio Queiroz. 
Flavio Bolsonaro, his father and Queiroz have all said they are innocent of any crime. 
The scandal arose after the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF) identified 48 suspicious deposits worth a total of 100,000 reais ($27,005.13) deposited in a single month in 2007 into Flavio's bank account. 
COAF also found 7 million reais in suspicious financial transactions in accounts belonging to Queiroz. 
The O Globo newspaper reported on Wednesday that it had viewed a federal police investigation into real estate deals Flavio carried out between 2014 and 2017 that resulted in an ""exceptional increase"" in his net worth. The police document did not provide details on what apartment deals or amounts of money were involved. 
That time period is roughly the same as when the 7 million reais in suspicious transactions flowed through the bank account of Queiroz. 

The prosecutor general's office confirmed it had received the case from federal police, but provided no details. Federal police did not respond to a request for comment.

The two countries have an unresolved maritime border dispute over a sea zone of about 860 sq km (330 square miles) which extends along the edge of three of Lebanon's energy blocks. 
U.S. diplomats mediated between them last year after a spike in tensions that also involved a row over a border wall Israel built and over Iran-backed Hezbollah's growing arsenal.
""(It is) a dangerous matter. Israel has licensed and exploited an area adjacent to the Lebanese southern maritime borders,"" MPs from Berri's Amal party quoted him as saying on Wednesday after a meeting. 
""This is an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty and targets our oil wealth and waters.""
The Israeli Energy Ministry did not immediately comment.
Berri vowed ""not to remain silent"" and will bring it up with the Italian prime minister visiting Beirut this week, as well as other foreign states, the lawmakers said. 
Ali Bazzi, an Amal lawmaker, said Israel pressed on with the ""violation"" even though the companies on the Lebanese side have stayed away from the contentious border. 
Lebanon sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean - along with Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Syria - where a number big gas fields have been discovered since 2009.
Lebanon has signed its first offshore oil and gas exploration and production agreements for two energy blocks, including one disputed by Israel. A consortium of France's Total, Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek signed the contracts.
Lebanon has said the dispute would not stop it benefiting from potential undersea reserves in Block 9, while consortium operator Total said it would not drill the block's first well near the disputed sliver of water. 

Instead, the well would be drilled more than 25 km (15 miles) from the maritime border claimed by Israel, Total has said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court on Wednesday found a Danish adherent of the Jehovah's Witnesses guilty of organizing a banned extremist group and jailed him for six years in a case critics condemn as crushing religious freedom. 
Armed police detained Dennis Christensen, a 46-year-old builder, in May 2017 at a prayer meeting in Oryol, some 200 miles (320 km) south of Moscow after a court in the region outlawed the local Jehovah's Witnesses a year earlier.
Russia's Supreme Court later ruled the group was ""extremist"" and ordered it to disband nationwide. Christiansen's detention, Russia's first extremism-related arrest of a Jehovah's Witness, foreshadowed dozens more. 
The court in the city of Oryol on Wednesday found Christiansen guilty after a long trial, his lawyer, his wife and a representative for the Jehovah's Witnesses told Reuters.
Christiansen had pleaded innocent, saying he was exercising freedom of religion guaranteed in Russia's constitution.
Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen called on Moscow to respect religious freedom and criticized it for classifying Jehovah's Witnesses on a par with terrorist groups. 
The U.S.-headquartered Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.
DOZENS MORE CAUGHT IN CRACKDOWN
But Russia's latest falling-out with the West, triggered by Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, spurred a more determined drive to push out ""the enemy within"".
With about 170,000 followers in Russia and 8 million worldwide, Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions.
They believe the end of the world as we know it is imminent, an event ""the obedient"" will survive to inhabit the Kingdom of God they believe will follow.
Christiansen moved to Murmansk in northern Russia in 2000 where the Jehovah's Witnesses were already well established and met his wife Irina there. The couple later moved to Oryol because the climate is milder and housing cheaper. 
He speaks Russian and says he is a fan of Russian culture. 
Anton Bogdanov, Christiansen's lawyer, said he planned to appeal Wednesday's verdict, which he termed illegal and feared would set a dangerous precedent.
More than 100 criminal cases have been opened against Jehovah's Witnesses, with another 24 people in prison awaiting or on trial and a similar number under house arrest. Some of their publications are on a list of banned literature. 
Yaroslav Sivulsky, a representative of the European Association of Jehovah's Witnesses, said the verdict evoked the atheist Soviet period when Moscow persecuted the group. 
""In essence we have returned to Soviet times,"" said Sivulsky, whose own father Pavel was jailed for seven years in 1959 for printing bible literature. ""It's sad that in the 21st century people are being jailed for holding what the authorities believe to be the wrong beliefs."" 
Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said there were clearly reasons for Christiansen's arrest but he was unaware of details.

Irina, Christiansen's wife, said she and her husband were calm despite what they saw as an injustice. Before the verdict, she said state TV had nurtured existing widespread prejudice in Russian society against Jehovah's Witnesses, a strategy she said helped distract people from low living standards.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO members signed an accord with Macedonia on Wednesday allowing the tiny ex-Yugoslav republic to become the 30th member of the U.S.-led alliance after a deal with Greece ended a 27-year-old dispute over its name.
At a formal signing of the NATO accession protocol, which must now be ratified by allied governments, Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov hailed the moment as showing that the country ""will never walk alone"" once in the alliance.
""We stand beside these 29 allies... able and ready to assume the obligations arising from our full membership in NATO,"" Dimitrov told a news conference after NATO ambassadors signed the protocol.
The ratification process typically takes about a year, and the United States has said it expects Macedonia - now known officially as North Macedonia under the terms of its name deal with Greece - to formally join the alliance in 2020.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the admittance of a new member highlighted that all European nations who met the entrance criteria could join the regional alliance, a position Moscow rejects.
""It shows that NATO's door remains open for countries that meet NATO standards and that adhere to the NATO values of democracy, the rule of law and individual liberty,"" Stoltenberg said.
Russia says that by taking in Balkan members, the alliance is undermining security in the region.
""MAKING THE WORLD MORE PEACEFUL""
But Dmitrov said Macedonia's decision would improve regional stability, echoing the view of Western countries which see NATO and EU membership as the best way of preserving peace in the Balkans after the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
""For us NATO is about making the world more peaceful, more stable,"" he said.
Three other ex-Yugoslav republics - Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro - have already joined NATO, as have other countries in the Balkan region including Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.
Both Greek and Macedonian parliaments have agreed to rename the country the Republic of North Macedonia, ending Athens' years-long veto of its neighbor's efforts to join NATO and the EU. Greece sees the use of ""Macedonia"" as implying territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has also warned NATO against cultivating closer ties with Ukraine and Georgia, two ex-Soviet republics that also aspire to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which is headquartered in Brussels.

After the Macedonia signing protocol, Stoltenberg praised Georgia on Wednesday, saying: ""We are very encouraged by what we see in Georgia, their commitment to reforms, their commitment to strengthening defense and security institutions, their commitment to transparency, judiciary reforms.""

It has now been finalised by Russia, Dmitry Shugayev, head of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, said in an interview published in Russia's Kommersant newspaper.
Kommersant had previously reported Moscow planned to grant Cuba a loan to buy Russian hardware such as tanks, armored vehicles and possibly helicopters.
Communist-ruled Cuba is a close ally of Venezuela, where Moscow-backed President Nicolas Maduro is facing pressure from the opposition and Western governments to step down.
Private Russian military contractors who carry out secret missions for the state flew into Venezuela last month, Reuters reported, citing two people close to the contractors. 
One of the sources said they flew there via Cuba.
In the newspaper interview, Shugayev said Russia has concerns about the Venezuelan crisis and was not considering scaling back defense cooperation with Caracas.

According to Shugayev, cooperation with Venezuela is limited to maintaining previously supplied arms and helping build military facilities.

PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - Signs that read “Parkland Strong” and “MSD Strong” still dot the well-manicured Florida town where a young gunman carried out the deadliest U.S. high school shooting on Valentine’s Day in 2018.
But as the Feb. 14 anniversary of the massacre that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland approaches, students, teachers, parents and community leaders continue struggling to cope with the trauma.
“There’s a lot of community angst, an overwhelming sadness and frustration because not much has changed in a year,” said Angela Burrafato, whose son graduated from the school last year.
Divides persist over where to put blame and how to prevent another tragedy.
Former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, criticized for the department’s handling of the shooting, was suspended last month by newly elected Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and is mounting a legal campaign to reclaim his job.
Some community members also are calling for the removal of Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie. 
The state's Republican-led legislature swiftly passed gun control measures after the shooting, including raising the age requirement and setting a three-day waiting period for gun purchases.
Critics argue the restrictions did not go far enough, while a Republican lawmaker from Florida's Panhandle region filed a bill last month to roll back some of the measures.
The community will come together, however, at a variety of events to mark the shooting that took the lives of 14 students and three adults. 
Therapy dogs will roam the high school's halls on Feb. 14, and the school day will end early. Students who opt not to attend classes will be excused, while those who come to campus have been encouraged to volunteer for community service projects.
An evening interfaith vigil is planned for the same park where thousands gathered the day after the shooting. Nearby, a California-based artist is erecting a 35-foot-tall, wooden “Temple of Time” commemorating the victims. 
It will be adorned with remembrances of the lives lost and will be razed a few weeks later, similar to the annual Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.
Free yoga classes and beach cleanups are being organized. A five-kilometer run honoring slain Stoneman football coach Aaron Feis is planned for Feb. 16.
Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky said the anniversary is a painful reminder of all the city suffered, but the volunteerism helps prevent the shooting from defining it, she said.

""We still have people helping each other, and that's who Parkland was before this, and who it is today,"" she said.

""Whether they want to or not, the Americans must leave Syria,"" Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was reported as saying.
There are fears in the West that Trump's plan to extricate about 2,000 soldiers from Syria will cede influence to Tehran, which has backed President Bashar al-Assad in the nearly eight-year war, and also allow Islamic State militants to regroup. 
""Now 90 percent of Syrian soil is under the control of the government and the rest will soon be freed by the Syrian army,"" Velayati added during a meeting with Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem in Tehran, according to the Tasnim news agency.
President Hassan Rouhani told Moualem that peace in Syria was a priority. ""One of the important regional and foreign policy goals of the Islamic Republic is the stability and complete security of Syria,"" Tasnim quoted him as saying. 
""And establishing normal conditions in Syria and the return of the people of this country to their normal lives.""
Moualem was in Tehran for negotiations before the meeting of leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Russian Black Sea resort town Sochi on Feb. 14 over Syria.
Separately, Rear-Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi, a deputy commander of the regular armed forces, said on Wednesday that Iran plans to extend the range of its land-to-sea missiles beyond 300 kilometers (186 miles), according to the Fars news agency.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - No matter who wins Algeria's presidential election, 29-year-old cardiologist Moumen Mohamed plans to seek his fortune elsewhere.
He is one of a growing number of young, educated Algerians who are looking for work in Europe or the Gulf to escape the low salaries imposed by a state-dominated economy at home.
The exodus of doctors, engineers and other highly skilled workers is a headache for a government hoping to engage with its largely youthful electorate ahead of the vote on April 18.
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81, has not said if he will seek a fifth term, although the ruling FLN party, labor unions and business leaders are urging him on.
For young professionals, the question is scarcely relevant. Many feel disconnected from an elite populated by the veterans of Algeria's 1954-1962 war of independence from France, an era they only know about from their grandparents.
They want to pursue their careers but feel discouraged by a system that offers low-paid jobs and little opportunity to better themselves.
""I have already done my paperwork to migrate,"" said Moumen, the cardiologist, who works at a state hospital. ""I am waiting for a response."" 
Nearly 15,000 Algerian doctors work in France now and 4,000 submitted applications to leave their home country last year, according to official figures.
The government does not accept all the blame.
""The press has exaggerated the phenomenon ... it is a problem for all Algerians, not just the government,"" Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in response to a reporter's question about young doctors leaving. 
But in Europe doctors can earn ten times what hey get in Algeria, a socialist economy where medical professionals are paid little more than less skilled public employees.
""Salaries, working conditions are bad, and above all there is no appreciation of doctors,"" said Mohamed Yousfi, head of the specialist doctors' union.
""Our doctors are filling the medical desert in Western countries like France, Canada and Germany. They are also present in the Gulf,"" said Yousfi, sitting in his office in the public hospital at Boufarik, a town near Algiers.
The hospital, which opened in 1872, was being refurbished by building workers, and Yousfi said medical equipment was readily available.
""The authorities focus on walls and equipment but forget human resources,"" he said.
PUBLIC SECTOR
Algeria has poured billions of dollars in the health sector in the past decades, with around 50,000 doctors and 150,000 beds available in 2018, official data shows.
The North African oil and gas producing nation guarantees citizens cradle-to-grave welfare, but lack of competition from the private sector means some services are poor.
The country only ranks 85 out of 189 in the Human Development Index of living standards compiled by the United Nations Development Programme. This is behind Western and Eastern Europe, the Gulf and even sanctions-hit Iran.
Many public hospitals do not offer the same level of quality as private clinics, which have been slowly opening. Those who can afford it go abroad for treatment.
""We are not respected as we should be as long as our dignitaries, ministers and generals continue to seek treatment overseas,"" said a doctor who asked not to be named.
Doctors are not the only ones who want to migrate. Pilots, computer engineers, oil drillers and even journalists are also heading for the airport, privately owned Algerian media report.
Around 10,000 engineers and drillers from the state energy firm Sonatrach have left the company in the past ten years, according to senior company officials. ""If nothing is done to improve working conditions and salaries, more and more will leave,"" a Sonatrach source said.
Most professionals head for the Gulf, where they earn good salaries.
""I left Algeria in 2015. I am a computer engineer and I am now in Oman working for a big telecoms firm,"" Messaoud Benali, 39, said by phone.
""I know plenty of educated Algerians who work in Gulf countries,"" he said.
Bouteflika must say whether he will run or not by March 3, according to the constitution.
If he does, he is expected to win despite his poor health, because the opposition remains weak and fragmented, analysts say. But how the ruling elite can connect with young people is another question altogether.
Algeria has one of the world's slowest internet speeds, but its young people are still very tech-savvy.
This became clear when 21-year-old singer Farouk Boujemline invited fans via Snapchat to celebrate his birthday in the center of Algiers.
About 10,000 showed up, jamming the traffic for hours, and police had to set up barriers around the city's independence monument to make sure the party didn't get out of control.
By contrast, Bouteflika, Prime Minister Ouyahia and several other ministers do not have Twitter accounts to communicate with the public.
Algeria is one of the few countries where government ministries still use fax machines to communicate with the outside world.
""How to reconnect with the young elite, this is the top priority for Algeria's next president,"" said political analyst Ferrahi Farid.
In the past, authorities could ensure public support by increasing salaries or extending the welfare state.
When riots erupted in Algiers in 2011, the government sought to prevent any spread of the Arab Spring uprisings by offering billions to pay for salary increases, interest-free loans, and thousands of jobs in the public sector.
But 95 percent of government income depends on oil and gas revenues, which halved in the years from 2014 to 2017, forcing officials to impose a public hiring freeze.

""When the oil price is $100 you can do a lot, but when it is $50 there is not much you can do,"" Farid said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Wednesday he hoped his historic trip to the Arabian peninsula will help dispel the notion of an inevitable clash of civilizations between Christianity and Islam.
Francis returned to Rome on Tuesday from the United Arab Emirates, where in Abu Dhabi he presided at the largest public Mass ever celebrated on the peninsula where Islam was born.
""In an era, like ours, where there is a strong temptation to see a clash between Christian civilization and the Islamic one, and even to consider religions as a source of conflict, we wanted to send another clear and decisive signal that encounter is possible,"" he said at his regular general audience.
Francis was referring to a document he signed during the trip with Sheik Ahmad el-Tayeb, grand imam of Egypt's al-Azhar mosque and university, one of the most authoritative theological and educational institutions in Islam.
The pope said the ""Document on Human Fraternity"" was proof that ""it is possible to respect each other and hold dialogue, and that despite differences in culture and traditions, the Christian and Islamic worlds appreciate and protect common values ...""
The document, signed on Monday, called on ""all concerned to stop using religions to incite hatred, violence, extremism and blind fanaticism, and to refrain from using the name of God to justify acts of murder, exile, terrorism and oppression.""
He invited everyone to read the document, saying it would offer ideas on how individuals can work for tolerance and coexistence.
Ultra-conservative Catholics have been opposed to any dialogue with Islam, with some saying its ultimate goal is to destroy the West.
On the plane returning from Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, a reporter asked Francis about possible negative reaction to the document by Catholics ""who accuse you of allowing yourself to be used by Muslims"".
Francis, a progressive who has been in the crosshairs of conservatives since his election in 2013, responded with a joke: ""Not only the Muslims. They accuse me of allowing myself to be used by everyone, even journalists. It's part of the job.""
But he said ""from a Catholic point of view, the document had not strayed a millimeter"" from teachings on inter-religious dialogue approved by the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council.

""If anyone feels bad, I understand. It is not an everyday thing. But it is a step forward,"" he said on the plane.

Auj-e Taqaddas, 42, was found guilty in a court in Bali's capital, Denpasar, of violence against an officer at Bali's airport carrying out his legal duty, Judge Esthar Oktavi told Reuters.
""The sentence is six months in prison,"" Oktavi said by text message.
The sentence was lighter than the one-year jail term sought by the prosecutor over the incident on July 28 last year. 
""This is an unfair decision ... I was forcibly brought to the court, no lawyers provided,"" Taqaddas told the court, accusing the prosecutors of torturing her three times and trapping her in the country.
The judge and prosecutor said Taqaddas had filed an appeal.
Her sentencing had been postponed several times because she was sick and also when authorities said she had checked out of a hotel, and could not find her, when they tried to collect her for the hearing.
A smartphone video of the purported incident, which went viral at the time, showed an agitated Taqaddas shouting and swearing at the immigration official, before slapping him across the face after grappling to snatch her passport back from him. 
The woman had overstayed by about 160 days and was asked to pay a fine of 300,000 rupiah ($21.60) for each day, or about $3,500 in all.
The resort island is Indonesia's main tourism hub, attracting millions of foreign tourists a year to its beaches, temples and bars.
A small number of visitors run into trouble with the law every year, sometimes for breaking the Southeast Asian country's tough laws on drugs.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand defended on Wednesday its arrest of a Bahraini footballer with refugee status in Australia, saying officials only detained him because Australian authorities sent an Interpol ""red notice"" after he boarded a plane to Bangkok.
Hakeem Al Araibi's case has drawn international criticism as a Thai court considers an extradition request from Bahrain for him to serve a 10-year sentence related to the Arab Spring uprising of 2011. He denies the charges.
Araibi was arrested at a Bangkok airport in November when he arrived from Australia with his wife for their honeymoon.
The 25-year-old says he faces torture in Bahrain and wants to return to Australia, where he has lived since 2014 and plays for a Melbourne football club. 
Thailand's foreign ministry on Wednesday described the case as ""involving two countries competing for Mr. Hakeem's custody"".
It said Thailand became involved ""by chance"" after a police bureau that handles Interpol matters in Australia notified Thai authorities that Araibi had boarded a flight to Bangkok and was the subject of a ""red notice"" initiated by Bahrain.
""It took several days after the arrival of Mr. Hakeem before the Australian authorities informed us that the red notice had been canceled,"" the statement said.
""By that time, legal proceedings in Thailand regarding Mr. Hakeem had already started and could not be reversed,"" it said.
Araibi could stay in jail until August, as the court hearing his case will take two to three months to deliver its ruling after the next hearing, set for late April, a spokesman for the attorney general's office said.
""So between now and then, Hakeem will have to be in custody for at least until August,"" Trumph Jalichandra told a news conference, adding that he could only be released sooner if Bahrain withdrew its request.
Araibi's soccer club, Pascoe Vale, said in a tweet: ""Our hearts are broken...we registered him today for the 2019 season. He is No. 5 on the team sheet and his shirt is waiting.""
Australia's Home Affairs office confirmed in December that federal police had advised Thai authorities a person with a red notice was on the way to Thailand but did not say if the bureau was aware Araibi had refugee status.
Bahrain's embassy in Bangkok said Araibi was a fugitive who should be returned.
""Mr. Al Araibi, as with defendants in all criminal cases in Bahrain, is guaranteed full legal rights and protections with full access to proper representation,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday.
SHACKLES
On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison repeated a call for Araibi to be freed, saying he was ""disturbed"" to see photos of the footballer in shackles at a court hearing this week.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne urged Thai authorities to use their discretion.
""Given ... that he is a permanent resident of our country, on the pathway to citizenship, we have encouraged the Bahraini government not to proceed with the extradition application, and we have encouraged the Thai government to exercise the discretion that they have available to them,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from the Solomon Islands.
Araibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station during 2011 anti-government protests in Bahrain and sentenced in absentia after he fled.
He denies the charges, saying he was playing in a televised soccer match at the time of the police station attack.
New York-based Human Rights Watch has said Araibi was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the 2011 protests.

Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.

The choice of location has added symbolism, as Britain prepares to leave the European Union next month while asserting that it will retain a key role in the continent's security.
The last NATO summit, at the alliance's Brussels headquarters in July, saw U.S. President Donald Trump unsettle many European allies, including Germany, with demands that they spend more on their own defense and reduce what he called their dependence on Russia for much of their energy needs.
Stoltenberg said: ""We are grateful to the United Kingdom for agreeing to host this meeting in NATO's 70th anniversary year.
""London was the home of NATO's first headquarters. The United Kingdom was one of the Alliance’s twelve founding members and continues to play a key role in the Alliance, making essential contributions to our shared security.

""The meeting in London will be an opportunity ... to address the security challenges we face now and in the future, and to ensure that NATO continues to adapt in order to keep its population of almost one billion people safe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told Americans on Tuesday his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan, and would be able to reduce U.S. troops there as negotiations advance to end America's longest war.
""Great nations do not fight endless wars,"" Trump said in his annual State of the Union address to Congress, in which he also said U.S. troops had nearly defeated Islamic State militants in Syria and it was time to bring them home. 
After 17 years of war in Afghanistan, Trump praised ""the unmatched valor"" of U.S. forces.
""Thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict,"" Trump said.
He said his administration was holding constructive talks with a number of groups, including the Taliban.
""As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. And we will indeed focus on counter-terrorism,"" Trump said.
Trump offered no specifics about when he would bring home the 14,000 U.S. troops now in Afghanistan. 
U.S.-led forces in 2001 toppled the hardline Taliban for harboring the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.
""We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement - but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace,"" Trump said.
In December, a U.S. official said Trump was planning to withdraw more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, triggering worries about whether a smaller force would be able to fulfill missions under way and stabilize the country. 
When he campaigned for president in 2016, Trump said he wanted to focus more on domestic issues than foreign conflicts.
However, Trump's sudden announcement in December that he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria alarmed allies and many current and former U.S. officials, who worry that Islamic State militants remain a threat.
After the speech, Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump's Syria plans did not seem well thought out, and could put U.S. allies like the Kurds and Israel at risk, while empowering Iran.
""We'll probably come back at a future date, with much more danger to our troops,"" Engel told Reuters. 
Earlier on Tuesday, General Joseph Votel, head of the military's Central Command, warned that Islamic State would pose an enduring threat.

In his address, Trump said Islamic State controlled more than 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. ""Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters,"" he said.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",Turkey probes deportation of Egyptian facing death penalty,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will investigate the deportation of an Egyptian facing execution in Cairo over a car bomb and has suspended eight policemen involved, the Istanbul governor's office said on Wednesday.
Mohamed Abdelhafiz Ahmed Hussein, whom the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement identifies as a member, was among 28 people sentenced in absentia to death in July 2017 for killing Egypt's public prosecutor in the attack, according to state media.
He was sent back to Egypt last month from Istanbul's main Ataturk airport on arrival from Somalia for not having a visa. 
The case adds to strained Turkey-Egypt relations since the army ousted President Mohamed Mursi, of the Brotherhood, following mass protests against his rule in 2013.
The Istanbul governor's office said on Tuesday that when Hussein arrived, there was no information he was facing trial anywhere, and he did not request protection, so officials deemed him an ""unacceptable passenger"" due to lack of a Turkish visa. 
In a separate statement on Wednesday, the governor's office said a commission had been set up to investigate the deportation and eight police officers were suspended from duty over it.
An adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong to repatriate anyone facing charges in Egypt and the matter needed checking.
""During the leadership of (Egyptian President Abdel Fattah) Sisi, Turkey has not and does not hand over anyone facing the death penalty or any other charges,"" Yasin Aktay wrote in the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper on Wednesday.
The Muslim Brotherhood has close ties with Turkey's ruling AK Party and many of its members have fled to Turkey since the group's activities were banned in Egypt.
Cairo says the Brotherhood, the world's oldest Islamist movement, is a terrorist organization. Most of its senior members have been arrested, driven into exile or underground.
The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful organization.
Defendants sentenced in absentia in Egypt are automatically retried once they are captured or turn themselves in.
Sources in Egypt's National Security Service said Hussein was questioned and moved to jail ahead of his retrial after arriving in Egypt.

Huang Xiangmo is unable to return to his Sydney home after the government rejected his application for citizenship and revoked his residence visa while he was overseas, the newspaper reported.
The newspaper did not report a reason for the decision but it cited the Ministry for Home Affairs, which oversees visa applications, as saying Huang was ""unfit"" for residency.
A ministry representative and a spokeswoman for Minister for Immigration David Coleman both declined to comment.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, asked about Huang, who had in recent years emerged as one of Australia's biggest political donors, said he would not comment on a ""sensitive matter"".
""The government has always acted consistent with the advice that we receive and that's what has happened on this occasion,"" he told reporters.
Huang, who founded the Chinese property developer Yuhu, was not available for comment. The newspaper said he went to Thailand last month and it was not clear where he was on Wednesday.
The case comes as Australia and China seek to repair ties that have been strained since 2017, when Australia accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs. China denied doing so. 
Despite the denials, Australia passed a series of tough laws designed to limit offshore influence, legislation widely seen as aimed at China. 
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), citing unidentified sources, said Huang would not be allowed to re-enter Australia.
Huang rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was in 2017 forced to resign after allegations emerged that he was linked to Chinese-aligned interests.
The opposition member, Sam Dastyari, sought to encourage a senior politician not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing's rule in Hong Kong in 2015.
Dastyari was also recorded as warning Huang that his phone may be tapped. 
Dastyari also appeared on a video tape, standing next to Huang, appearing to endorse China's contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party’s platform.
Morrison, asked later about money that Huang had donated, referred to the law introduced to ban foreign donations.
""The actions we've been taking in relation to this gentleman, that's based on information that exists today,"" Morrison said. He did not elaborate.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne declined to comment on the details of Huang's case.
""I don't expect it to be the subject of a bilateral discussion,"" Payne told the ABC when asked if she feared the issue would have an impact on relations with China.
""We have a good relationship with mutual respect.""
In 2018, Huang's Yuhu announced the purchase for nearly A$1 billion ($715 million) for two Australian projects owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's parliament on Wednesday voted to set up a committee to discuss amending the country's constitution, despite objections by military-aligned lawmakers against a move that is likely to challenge the army's power.
Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) submitted an ""emergency proposal"" last week aimed at amending parts of the military-drafted 2008 constitution that the party deems undemocratic.
It was the Nobel laureate's biggest challenge to the military's power in nearly three years, and sparked a protest in the legislature from green-glad army appointees, who stood in silence for several minutes to show their opposition.
The move comes as both civilian and military leaders face growing international pressure over an army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in 2017 that sent about 730,000 people fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.
In a vote among members of both houses of parliament, 414 out of 611 voting lawmakers were in favor of setting up the committee. 
Suu Kyi's party commands a large majority in the combined Union Parliament.
""Representatives from political parties and military lawmakers will be involved proportionally,"" speaker T Khun Myat told the house, announcing that deputy speaker Tun Tun Hein, an NLD lawmaker, would chair the new committee.
The constitution guarantees the army a quarter of seats in parliament, as well as control of key ministries. Change to the charter needs a vote of more than 75 percent of members, giving the military an effective veto.
Debating the proposal in parliament on Tuesday, NLD lawmakers said there was public support for amending the charter and that the new committee would allow all parties to have a say.
MPs from the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) said the proposal was not in line with the section of the constitution on amendments. 
""We don’t oppose constitutional amendment,"" said USDP lawmaker Thaung Aye. ""Suitable sections of the constitution should be amended in the interests of the people at a suitable time. However, it must be in line with the law.""
The constitution also blocks Suu Kyi from becoming president, with a prohibition on presidential candidates with foreign spouses or children. Suu Kyi had two sons with her late British academic husband, Michael Aris.

The NLD has not said what provisions of the constitution it might seek to reform. In the past, some members of the party have called for change to Article 436, which governs amending the charter.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras paid a symbolic visit to Istanbul's former cathedral Hagia Sophia on Wednesday on a trip aimed at improving ties with Turkey, long strained by disputes over territory, energy exploration and Cyprus.
Tsipras met Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Tuesday, where the Turkish president said he expected more cooperation from Athens in the repatriation of eight soldiers who fled to Greece following an attempted coup in 2016.
Tsipras told their joint news conference that Greece does not welcome putschists, but that the case of the eight soldiers was a matter for the judiciary.
He said both countries had agreed to de-escalate tensions in the Aegean Sea and proceed with confidence building measures. Differences with Turkey ""can and must be solved with dialogue,"" he added.
Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin accompanied Tsipras on his tour of Hagia Sophia, which was the foremost cathedral in Christendom for 900 years and one of Islam's greatest mosques for another 500 years. It has been a museum since 1935.
Tsipras will later visit an island near Istanbul to attend mass at the Orthodox Halki theological school, a center of scholarship until it was closed by the Turkish state in 1971. Turkey’s refusal to reopen it is another bone of contention.
He will also meet Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of Orthodox Christians worldwide, and representatives of the Greek community in Istanbul.
Another source of tensions between the Aegean neighbors is the divided island of Cyprus, split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. U.N.-led peace talks between the Greek and Turkish sides collapsed in 2017.
NATO members Greece and Turkey were nearly drawn into a military clash as recently as 1996 over an uninhabited Aegean islet.

On Tuesday, Turkey updated a list of former military officers wanted for their alleged role in the 2016 failed putsch to include the eight officers granted asylum in Greece, and offered a bounty of 4 million Turkish lira ($770,446) for each of them.

Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that Ali Issa Ahmed was held after being accused of showing sympathy to Qatar after wearing a shirt of their national soccer team to an Asian Cup match in the Gulf Arab state. 
Showing sympathy toward Qatar has been a criminal offense in the UAE since June 2017 when it, along with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, cut ties with Qatar over allegations it supports terrorism. Doha denies the charges.
Britain's Foreign Office is providing assistance to ""a British man arrested in the UAE and we are in touch with the local authorities"", a spokesman said. 
The UAE government said in a statement that Ahmed, who they said also has Sudanese citizenship, had gone to a police station in the UAE emirate of Sharjah to complain that he had been harassed and assaulted by supporters of the UAE national side at the tournament.
""The police took him to hospital where a doctor who examined him concluded that his injuries were inconsistent with his account of events and appeared to be self-inflicted,"" the government said. 
It said Ahmed had later admitted to making false statements and wasting police time after being charged on Jan. 24 and will now be processed through UAE courts.
It was not immediately clear what punishment Ahmed could face if found guilty.
Qatar's side was supported by thousands of Omanis in the Asian Cup final, which Qatar won. They wore Qatar scarves and shirts.
Qatar were also supported throughout the tournament by a South Korean woman and a Chinese man who dressed in the colors of the Qatar flag.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2019 12:08AM ET</span>",Hammer and pickle: Vietnam-style reform would mean big changes for North Korea,"By James Pearson
HANOI (Reuters) - Nestled in a leafy park between a rusting Soviet fighter jet and the old East German embassy, a lonely statue of Lenin stands in the center of Hanoi as a symbol of the Russian revolutionary's inspiration to Communist-ruled Vietnam.
In 1986, one year after the statue was erected, Vietnam embarked on its comprehensive program of ""doi moi"" reforms which transformed the country from a war-torn agrarian basket case into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.
Today, Hanoi's ""Lenin Park"" is popular, not for Vietnamese paying homage to their communist roots but for a dedicated crew of skateboarders aping their Western cohorts.
As Vietnam prepares to host North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump's second summit later this month, the Vietnamese model of reform is being widely touted as the economic path for impoverished and isolated North Korea to follow. 
Vietnamese reforms have seen per capita GDP soar almost five-fold since 1986 and kept Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent, firmly in power.
But it has necessitated political change and levels of individual freedoms that would require major reforms in North Korea, where Kim Jong Un exercises almost total control and is revered by state propaganda as a living deity.
""When all the power is in the hand of a single person, decisions are prone to mistakes,"" said Cao Si Kiem, the former governor of Vietnam's state bank who enacted sweeping reforms of Hanoi's monetary policy from 1989-1997.
""We had to accept power dilution,"" Kiem told Reuters, referring to Vietnam's era of opening up.
When Vietnamese revolutionary and founding president Ho Chi Minh's health was failing during the Vietnam War, his right hand man in the Party, Le Duan, took over and ruled as a strongman until his death in 1986.
Duan's demise ended Vietnam's ""strongman era"", and helped facilitate economic and then political reforms, said Le Hong Hiep, a fellow at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.
""Le Duan was a hardcore communist, an old guard of the Leninist political and economic system,"" said Hiep. 
""After his demise, no single politician could command such a level of control. Instead, the politburo took over and became the most important decision maker, albeit on a consensus basis"".
GOODBYE, LENIN!
North Korea, by comparison, has only ever known its strongman era. Kim Jong Un officially derives his political legitimacy from his father and former leader, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather and founding leader, Kim Il Sung.
Together, they form the ""bloodline of Mount Paektu,"" a reference to a legendary volcano on the border of China and North Korea, where the eldest Kim is said to have coordinated his guerrilla war against colonial Japan.
North Korea's ""Juche"" ideology of self-sufficiency officially replaced Marxism-Leninism in 1972. While Juche has its roots in the Soviet ideology, references to Marxism-Leninism and communism have been slowly phased out. 
The ruling Kims are afforded godlike status in the country. Even the official exchange rate for the Korean People's Won was, until 2001, pegged at 2.16 won to the dollar, because of Kim Jong Il's February 16 birthday. 
But under Kim Jong Un, who activists say has led a brutal crackdown against dissent and defectors, some progress on economic reforms has been made.
Kim has allowed some markets in North Korea to develop, introduced more Special Economic Zones and called for factories to expand their product ranges to cater for diverse consumer tastes. 
""In the North Korean context, this is huge - so much further than under previous leaders,"" said Andray Abrahamian, a Korea expert at Stanford University's Asia Pacific Research Centre.
By 2016, four years after Kim came to power, the rate of economic growth in North Korea hit a 17-year high, according to South Korea's central bank. That growth contracted last year under pressure from international sanctions over its weapons programs, the bank said.
""North Korea is embracing markets to an unprecedented degree, but there are still some key limitations,"" said Abrahamian, citing the need for official systems of property ownership and land use and a loosening of surveillance on visiting foreigners to encourage offshore investment.
COMMUNIST CHIC
So far, economic changes, which have been officially communicated in state propaganda as Kim-led initiatives to improve living standards, have come with little political liberalization.
North Korea is still officially tax-free and, despite the fact many North Koreans rely on the markets instead of the state for food, Pyongyang still professes to have a functioning public distribution system.
In Vietnam, such rationing was abandoned as reforms were embraced.
Today, the Vietnamese economy has become so open the ""subsidy era"", when Vietnam went through its most literal iteration of communism, is remembered mainly as a ""vintage"" design trope in novelty coffee shops and restaurants.
In North Korea, such imagery is sanctified.
""It feels more nostalgic than the more modern coffee shops,"" said university student Nguyen Hoang Phuong Ngan as she sipped a coconut latte at Cong Ca Phe, a popular cafe chain which uses communist-era propaganda in its branding.
The road to change in Vietnam hasn't always been so relaxed, however.
In 1996, 10 years into the reform program, government officials staged the public destruction of foreign video cassettes and pornographic posters at Lenin Park to rid Vietnam of ""social evils"".
Now, while the Lenin statue still casts a shadow over the square, skateboarders there are mostly amused or ambivalent about his presence.
""This is a street sport from the West, so the fact I'm doing it right here in front of the Lenin statue is really something,"" said 27-year-old jazz pianist and skateboarder Nhat Huy Le.

""It's fun.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani said on Tuesday no peace deal between the Taliban and the United States could be finalised without involving his government as ""the decision-maker"".
Ghani's government has so far been shut out of the evolving peace talks between Taliban negotiators and U.S. envoys to end more than 17 years of war, with the hardline Islamist movement branding his government a U.S. puppet.
He made his remarks in a television interview as Afghan opposition politicians, including his predecessor Hamid Karzai, met Taliban representatives in Moscow.
""At the end of any peace deal, the decision-maker will be the government of Afghanistan,"" Ghani told TOLO News, the country's largest private television station.
""No power in the country can dissolve the government,"" said Ghani, who added he was ready to ""stand and defend our country"".
""Rest assured that no one can push us aside,"" he said.
With both sides hailing progress in talks in Qatar last month, U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is due to meet Taliban representatives there again on Feb. 25.
Ghani's comments were some of the most extensive since he met Khalilzad in Kabul last week after the latest round of talks.
He said on Twitter early on Wednesday he had received assurances by phone from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Washington's commitment to an ""enduring partnership"" with Afghanistan.
Their military partnership was ""unwavering"" and would remain until a lasting and inclusive peace was achieved, he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the peace talks in his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday, describing the talks as ""constructive"" and that Washington would be able to reduce the number of U.S. troops and focus on counter-terrorism efforts as they made progress.
""We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement - but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace,"" Trump said.
CEASEFIRE, WITHDRAWAL
U.S. officials say any withdrawal is contingent on a ceasefire - something the Taliban insists on happening first - and that the movement must be prepared to enter talks with the Afghan government to help create a durable peace.
After two years of intensified attacks by the Taliban on the Afghan government, military and foreign forces, they now control or contest nearly half of the districts across Afghanistan.
A ceasefire and the withdrawal of thousands of U.S.-led NATO troops is on the table after Washington secured earlier assurances from the Taliban that they would not allow groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State to attack the United States and its allies.
Western diplomats and security advisers believe a swift foreign pullout would put the stretched Afghan forces under severe strain.
""The Taliban said they are ready to sever ties with al Qaeda and the Islamic State, and this is a good development,"" Ghani said.
A U.S. general told a Senate hearing shortly before Ghani's interview was broadcast that the talks were in their early stages and the Afghan government would have to be part of any negotiated solution.
""I would characterize where we are in the process as very, very early in the process,"" U.S. General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, told a Senate hearing.
Votel also said the United States would need to continue to support Afghan security forces financially even if U.S. troops withdrew.
The United States has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission and a separate counter-terrorism effort largely directed at groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.

Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries also participate in Resolute Support.

(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren identified herself as an ""American Indian"" in hand-writing on her 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday.
The disclosure marks the latest twist in a controversy surrounding Warren and her claims to Native American ancestry as she raises money and hires staff ahead of an expected formal launch to her 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The yellow registration card, which is dated April 1986, was filled out in blue ink and signed by Warren, the Post reported.
A photograph of the card posted online by the newspaper shows that Warren listed the university and law school she attended. On a line listed for race Warren wrote ""American Indian.""
The Post reported that Warren apologized during an interview for identifying herself as a Native American. The paper said her office did not dispute the card's authenticity. Reuters reporters have not inspected the card in person.
She could not be reached for comment.
Warren angered tribal leaders and some of her fellow Democrats when she announced she had taken a DNA test to put to rest criticism from Republicans, and especially President Donald Trump, of her ancestry claims.
The results found Warren had at least one Native American ancestor many generations ago. However, Native American leaders criticized Warren for using a DNA test to lay claim to even a vague connection to a tribal nation, saying culture and sovereignty were just as important as blood and the tests did not confer the rights of tribal citizenship. 
Democrats feared Warren was playing into the hands of Trump and other Republicans by engaging them on the issue. 
The Cherokee Nation said last week Warren had apologized for taking the test and reaffirmed she was not a citizen of any tribal nation.

Warren has created an exploratory committee to begin raising money and hiring staff for a run at the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. She is expected to formally launch her campaign on Saturday.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania court on Friday ordered former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky to be resentenced for his child sex abuse conviction, saying the mandatory minimum sentence of 30-60 years had become illegal since the trial judge imposed it.
In its ruling on Friday, the Pennsylvania Superior Court denied Sandusky, now 75, a new trial on charges of raping boys left in his care, even as it said a resentencing was warranted.
Al Lindsay, Sandusky's lawyer, said he planned to appeal the court's rejection of his claim that the former assistant to legendary Penn State head coach Joe Paterno had ineffective legal counsel during his trial. 
Sandusky’s conviction was “one of the most profound injustices in the history of American jurisprudence,” Lindsay wrote in a statement, saying he would bring the case to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
The resentencing will likely take place in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, by visiting Judge John Foradora of Jefferson County, who began hearing Sandusky’s post-conviction appeal after the trial judge, John Cleland, recused himself.
Peter Goldberger, a lawyer in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, who specializes in state and federal appeals, said Friday’s ruling stemmed from a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that it was unconstitutional to require judges to impose mandatory minimum sentences.
At the time of Sandusky’s sentencing in October 2012, Pennsylvania imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in cases of sexual assault against children under age 16.
Goldberger said the resentencing judge could give Sandusky exactly the same sentence if he felt it was justified, so long as he did not base it on a mandatory minimum. He could also reduce it if he believed the defendant’s age, health or other circumstances warranted it. 

There was no indication on Monday when resentencing might take place.

Madrid's refusal to accept drivers' demands came after ride-hailing companies Uber and Cabify said last week they were suspending their services in Barcelona in response to the regional government's imposition of limits on how they operate in the city.
Union representatives in Madrid said the strike had demonstrated the unity and power of the drivers, which would help them continue the fight for their demands.
""It is a long war, in which you can lose battles, but in the end I'm sure we can win,"" Julio Sanz, head of the Taxi Federation union, told reporters.
The city's taxi drivers started the protests on Jan. 20 against the private services, which offer rides that often undercut taxi prices and can be hailed via the internet rather than in the street.
Last week, riot police backed by a fleet of tow trucks had to clear hundreds of vehicles blocking the capital's Paseo de la Castellana thoroughfare. 
In September, Spain's government gave ride-hailing companies four years to comply with regulation granting them just one new license for every 30 taxi licenses. The cab drivers are demanding stricter regulations now.

Following protests by Barcelona taxi-drivers, the Catalan government had ruled that ride-hailing services could only pick up passengers after a 15-minute delay from the time they were booked.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A bank in Portugal has blocked Venezuela's attempt to transfer $1.2 billion to Uruguay, a lawmaker said on Tuesday as the opposition to President Nicolas Maduro warned of the theft of public funds, while the United States sent food and medical aid to the Venezuelan-Colombian border. 
Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation, with the United States and a growing number of other nations recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president. 
Pope Francis on Tuesday expressed willingness for the Vatican to mediate Venezuela's mounting crisis if both sides seek it. Russia, which along with China has backed Maduro in the crisis, underscored its view that the crisis can be resolved only with negotiations between the government and opposition.
Guaido, who declared himself interim president last month, is scheduled to meet later on Tuesday with business leaders at Venezuela's main business group, Fedecamaras, to discuss an economic recovery plan under a future transition government in the OPEC-member South American country.
Maduro's adversaries have warned that Venezuelan officials are seeking to drain state coffers ahead of a potential change of government.
Portugal-based Novo Banco halted the $1.2 billion transfer of Venezuelan government financial assets to Uruguayan banks, legislator Carlos Paparoni said during a congressional session, a day after Guaido said authorities were trying to move funds.
""I'm pleased to inform the Venezuelan people that this transaction has until now been halted, protecting the resources of all Venezuelans,"" Paparoni said.
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles all media inquiries, did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
Lisbon-based Novo Banco, which is 75 percent-owned by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star Funds, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Major European nations including Britain, Germany, France and Spain joined the United States on Monday in recognizing Guaido, while members of a separate regional bloc, the so-called Lima Group, kept the political heat on Maduro.
In power since former President Hugo Chavez's death in 2013, Maduro has been accused by critics of running the OPEC nation of 30 million people like a dictatorship. Critics have called last year's disputed presidential vote in which Maduro won re-election a sham, and the mainstream opposition boycotted it.
Trucks carrying food and medical supplies sent by the United States to be stockpiled until it can be brought into Venezuela will arrive later this week at Guaido's request and will be prepositioned at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta, U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan said. 
It is unclear how the supplies will get into Venezuela without Maduro's blessing and cooperation of the Venezuelan military, which has remained loyal to his government and is stationed on the Venezuelan side of the border.
VATICAN INTERVENTION
The pope, speaking to reporters aboard his plane while returning from a trip to Abu Dhabi, confirmed that Maduro had written a letter to him but said he had not yet read it. Maduro told Italian broadcaster Sky TG24 on Monday that he had sent the letter to the pope ""for help in the process of facilitating and reinforcing dialogue.""
Asked about a possible direct mediation effort by the Vatican, the pope said, ""I will read the letter and see what can be done, but the initial condition is that both sides ask for it. We are willing.""
Given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to address the Venezuela situation in his annual State of the Union address in Washington later on Tuesday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Venezuela crisis could be solved only by getting the authorities and opposition to talk to each other, Russia's RIA news agency reported.

""We continue to believe that the only way to exit this crisis is by sitting the government and opposition down at the negotiating table,"" Lavrov was quoted as saying by RIA. ""Otherwise it will simply be the same regime change that the West had done many times.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The spread of state welfare for children around Africa has the potential to make a major dent in global poverty, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
Children account for the majority of those around the world in extreme poverty, living on less than $1.90 per day, with half of them in Africa, where social security systems are weak.
Globally, about a third of children are covered by social protection programs, but it ranges from 88 percent in Europe and Central Asia to 16 percent in Africa, said a new study by two U.N. bodies.
""The evidence shows clearly that social protection benefits, and cash transfers in particular, have a positive impact on poverty, food security, health and access to education – thus helping to ensure that children can realize their full potential, breaking the vicious cycle of poverty,"" it said.
Cash on its own was not a magic bullet and needed to be part of broader policies, supported by other benefits such as school meals, said the study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and children's agency UNICEF. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, expected to have 90 percent of children in extreme poverty by 2030, 40 out of 48 countries have some form of cash transfer program, but most pay too little and overall only 13.1 percent of children receive them. 
""They aren't all huge programs but it's been a real growth in the region and it's moving very, very quickly,"" David Stewart, UNICEF's head of child poverty, told reporters.
Children up to the age of 14 make up 42.9 percent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, where public spending on child welfare amounts to only 0.7 percent of GDP, compared to 2.5 percent in Europe, which has far fewer children. 
Several African countries were to discuss expanding their coverage at a conference in Geneva this week, Stewart said. 
Isabel Ortiz, head of social protection at the ILO, said South Africa was making massive progress but still did not offer universal coverage, while Ghana was reallocating fuel subsidies towards child benefits and Zambia was increasing tax on mining, showing some of the options if governments were willing.
""Just saying we don't have the budget is not good enough,"" she said. 
The ILO-UNICEF study also warned about the re-emergence of poverty in Europe, where some governments are cutting back child benefits due to austerity.

The UAE and Saudi Arabia are leading a military coalition, including local forces drawn from various Yemeni factions, that is trying to restore the internationally recognized government ousted from power in 2014 by the Iranian-aligned Houthi group.
""Emirati forces receive billions of dollars' worth of arms from Western states and others, only to syphon them off to militias in Yemen that answer to no-one and are known to be committing war crimes,"" Amnesty said in a statement.
""The proliferation of these fighting forces is a recipe for disaster for Yemeni civilians who have already been killed in their thousands, while millions more are on the brink of famine as a direct result of the war,"" the human rights group said.
The UAE government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Amnesty statement.
The UAE has trained and armed thousands of Yemeni fighters, mostly in southern provinces and western coastal areas, as part of the forces battling the Houthis, who control most urban areas including the capital Sanaa and the main port of Hodeidah.
Western nations, many of which provide weapons and intelligence to the coalition, have pressed for an end to the almost four-year war after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi increased scrutiny of Saudi activities in the region.
Rights groups have accused both sides in the conflict of committing possible war crimes, including abuse of detainees, a charge the warring parties have denied.
Amnesty called on states to suspend arms sales to the warring parties until there is ""no longer a substantial risk"" they may be used to breach humanitarian or human rights law. 

The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran. The Houthis deny charges that Iran supplies them with weapons and say their revolution is a popular one against corruption.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed a Mideast policy bill on Tuesday including a measure that would allow states to penalize businesses that take part in boycotts of Israel and an amendment that breaks with President Donald Trump by opposing any plans for an abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria.
The Senate backed the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act by a lopsided 77-23 on Tuesday, hours before Trump was to deliver his annual State of the Union speech discussing his policies for the year.
Trump is expected to discuss foreign policy in the address to a joint session of Congress, including declaring the Islamic State militant group all but defeated.
Many members of Congress, including several fellow Republicans, strongly disagree with a plan Trump announced in December to withdraw 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria on the grounds that the militant group no longer posed a threat.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who rarely breaks from Trump, introduced the non-binding amendment passed on Tuesday. It acknowledged progress against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Afghanistan but warned that ""a precipitous withdrawal"" could destabilize the region and create a vacuum that could be filled by Iran or Russia.
The amendment called on the Trump administration to certify conditions had been met for the groups' ""enduring defeat"" before any significant withdrawal from Syria or Afghanistan.
The bill also includes provisions supported by both Republicans and Democrats to impose new sanctions on Syria and guarantee security assistance to Israel and Jordan. Those are seen as efforts to reassure allies worried about shifts in U.S. policy, including Trump's Syria plan.
To become law, however, the bill would need to pass the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, where it is unlikely to move without significant changes because of concerns about the provision addressing the ""Boycott, Divest and Sanction"" movement targeted at Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
Opponents of that provision argue that Americans' participation in boycotts is protected by the constitutional right to free speech.

(This story corrects paragraph 7 to show that the bill includes several provisions)

The accuser said that Arias assaulted her at his home in Costa Rican capital San Jose in 2014, according to The New York Times and reports in local media. 
The accuser's name was published in the media reports. Reuters was unable to reach her for comment. 
""I categorically reject the accusations against me. I have never disrespected the wishes of any woman,"" Arias said in a statement through his lawyer.
Arias, 78, was president of Costa Rica twice, first between 1986-90, and then 2006-10. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987. 
The Public Ministry confirmed that the woman presented a complaint on Monday afternoon but did not give further details. The New York Times said that it had been provided with a copy of the complaint by the accuser, which was filed with federal prosecutors. 
The woman is an anti-nuclear activist who often met with Arias, who supported her cause, the New York Times report said. It cited the woman as saying that she had been inspired by the #metoo movement over sexual misconduct and that she was coming forward to protect other young women.

The woman, who is not seeking monetary damages, alleged that Arias touched her breasts and put his hand under her clothes, according to The New York Times and local media.

Officials have been working on the plan, which has been drawn up by Japan's Fujitsu and involves a tracking system that monitors vehicles on designated routes, for 10 months, the report said, citing leaked documents.
Brexit Minister Steve Barclay is closely examining the plan, the report said.
However, it added that the plan has been ""dusted down"" in the last week in the aftermath of members of parliament voting to replace the present Irish backstop with a different one that could include ""alternative arrangements"".
The plan aims at ensuring that there is no requirement for physical checks on the border, according to the report. It would involve a tracking system that will monitor vehicles on designated routes when they cross from Northern Ireland to Ireland through number plate recognition cameras and GPS technology. 
The Irish border is presently open and frictionless with no controls as both the United Kingdom and Ireland are EU members. Britain is due to leave EU on March 29.

Britain, Ireland and the EU want to avoid physical checks on the border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland that ceased with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

Those plans had been called into question on Monday after a Finance Ministry document obtained by Reuters showed the government's tax revenues were likely to rise less than expected in coming years due to a slowing economy.
The document showed the ministry had earmarked just 7.3 billion euros ($8.34 billion) for further defense and development aid spending through 2022, a sum seen as insufficient to allow Germany to reach the 1.5 percent target, which is already below a larger NATO target of 2 percent of GDP.
Germany is under pressure from the United States and other NATO members to boost military spending to 2 percent of GDP, in line with a target agreed in 2014 by members of NATO.
Der Spiegel said Germany's envoy to NATO delivered a three-page document to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday with a binding pledge to boost spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024 and continue increasing it thereafter.
The document did not, however, include any figures or a timetable for how Berlin will achieve the higher spending outlays, Spiegel said. It noted the German budget would have to expand to over 60 billion euros from 43.2 billion euros now to reach the targeted percentage.
Military spending remains a source of great tension within Germany's ruling coalition, with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives pushing for quicker increases in defense budgets while the Social Democratic coalition partners are riding the brakes. 
The issue is also a major irritant in ties between Germany and the United States.
Asked about the ministry document, Richard Grenell, U.S. Ambassador to Germany, on Monday urged Germany to stick to its NATO commitments.

""NATO members are expected to reach their 2 percent commitment by 2024. Now is not the time to take NATO for granted or undercut it in any way,"" he said.

Dassault Aviation and Airbus, which will build the jet that is expected to replace Dassault's Rafale and Germany's Eurofighters by 2024, will start work on the concept and architectures of the program, the source said.
The companies are expected to launch demonstrators of aircraft and engine by mid-2019. 
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel first announced plans in July 2017 for the new Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which will include a fighter jet and a range of associated weapons, including drones.
After nearly two years of preparatory work by the companies involved, Wednesday's agreements and contract signing will pave the way for the program to begin in earnest.
Airbus and Dassault have been waiting for initial contracts to be signed to start work on the new project.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Germany's MTU Aero Engines are expected to join forces to develop the engine for the new warplane, while French electronics firm Thales and European missile maker MBDA would also participate.
French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly and German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen will preside over the signing ceremony at a Safran site in northeastern Paris on Wednesday.
Germany removed a key obstacle to progress on the project last week when it bowed to French demands and excluded Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter from a multibillion-euro tender to replace ageing Tornado fighter jets that are fitted to carry U.S. nuclear weapons.
Paris, Germany's closest European partner, had warned that buying the F-35 in particular would derail plans to develop the new Franco-German fighter by 2040 since it would constitute a potential competitor to that project.
France and Germany will add Spain as a full partner in the program this summer, sources told Reuters in December.
Britain, which is due to exit the European Union in March, unveiled its own rival aircraft development program, dubbed Tempest, at the Farnborough Air Show in July.
European military and industry executives say they believe the two programmes could and should eventually be merged given the need to compete internationally and the many billions of euros needed to develop a new combat aircraft.
The French army source said France and Germany were open to more European partners joining the program.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha is known for losing his temper in public, but recently he has displayed a softer side amid speculation he may run for office in the first elections since the army seized power in 2014.
The general-turned-prime minister has appeared on state television cooking a chicken curry for villagers and riding a tractor with farmers. Last month, he released one of his trademark ballads, which has been played repeatedly on the radio.
""Don't let anyone destroy things like in the past ... Hold our hands sincerely and go forward together,"" goes the song, which was written by the 64-year-old leader himself.
Prayuth, in short, has been acting a lot like a politician - even as he keeps the country waiting to hear if he will be a candidate in a long-delayed general election to restore civilian rule, now set for March 24.
The election is seen as a battle between voters loyal to ousted populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister Yingluck - both deposed in military coups - and establishment-minded traditionalists who accuse the Shinawatras of corruption.
A pro-military party, Palang Pracharat, last week asked Prayuth to be its prime ministerial candidate.
Prayuth, however, says he needs time to think. Technically, he has until Friday, the deadline to register candidates.
Most presume he will not be able to resist entering the race.
Under a new constitution ratified in 2016, the military has a powerful sway over who will be prime minister.
A combined majority of the 250-seat Senate, entirely appointed by the junta, and the 500-seat House of Representatives chooses the prime minister.
So a candidate who can count on the support of the Senate would only need 126 votes in the lower house to have an overall majority.
Even if he doesn't stand in the election, Prayuth could still return as a last-minute ""outside"" prime minister if parties cannot agree on any of the candidates listed before the vote.
LOVE, NOT FEAR
Despite the built-in advantages, Prayuth's transition from coup-maker to candidate may not be easy.
Since taking power, he has often shown flares of temper. He once threatened to throw a podium during a press briefing and at another time mused he could ""probably just execute"" a roomful of reporters.
He drew fire from rights groups for a ban on political activity and internet censorship, and for detaining and summoning hundreds of activists and dissidents for ""attitude adjustment"".
Now, Prayuth must act less authoritarian, said political scientist Prajak Kongkirati, who lectures at Bangkok's Thammasat University
""Prayuth needs people to love him now because to win an election you cannot use fear,"" Prajak said. ""He knows he cannot be a dictator forever.""
In Thailand's deeply divided politics, Prayuth appeals to the royalist, military and middle-class opponents of Thaksin, who is seen as corrupt demagogue for policies that included subsidised health care and support for rice farmers.
Both Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, and his sister, Yingluck, forced from office in 2014, live in exile. Both have been convicted of corruption, which they deny.
For many in the elite, Prayuth's 2014 coup was necessary - and they might vote for him to extend his tenure, said Pongphisoot Busbarat at Chulalongkorn University
""Prayuth has been doing well for the elite, big businesses and royalist allies,"" Pongphisoot said. ""His grumpy character may appear a liability to his image for many voters, but for his supporters it is his strength.""
'UNCLE TU'
Prayuth was born in 1954 to a military family in the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, and his military career was forged during a turbulent period.
He was in pre-cadet school in 1973 when student protests brought down a military regime, ushering in democratic rule.
Three years later, he was at the prestigious Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy when right-wing mobs massacred dozens of left-leaning student protesters leading to another military takeover.
In the army, Prayuth was known for his decisiveness and devotion to the revered monarchy. This year's election comes just six weeks before the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who assumed the throne after the death of his father, who reigned for 70 years.
Prayuth rose in the ranks to become army chief, and in 2014 staged Thailand's 13th successful military coup. His reputation for testiness came almost immediately.
There are also more eccentric moments that endear Prayuth, known by his nickname ""Uncle Tu"", to his supporters, like his ballads and when he kissed a frog in 2017.
""It's like he has two personalities,"" said Wassana Nanuam, a veteran journalist who has followed Prayuth's career since 2003.
""He also knows how to use humor which people know isn't fake.""
Prayuth, whose office did not respond to requests for an interview, spends most of his private time with his wife and twin daughters, in their 30s, at his home at a military base.
One leisure activity he has had to give up is riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle.
""Sometimes he just starts his Harley up at home because he can't go out. He hasn't been able to ride outside since he became army chief, because he would require security to follow him,"" said government spokesman Lieutenant General Werachon Sukhondhapatipak. 
After nearly five years in power, Prayuth is not acting like a man ready to ride into the sunset.
""I am a soldier, so if you criticize me a lot I will get angry,"" Prayuth told reporters in November. 

""But I have to adjust myself now because I have to be patient to be a politician.""

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado jogger strangled a juvenile mountain lion in the foothills of Horsetooth Mountain northwest of Denver, acting in self-defense after the predator attacked him, authorities said on Tuesday.
The man, who was not identified, survived the life-and-death struggle in the Horsetooth Mountain Open Space, a mountain park less than 70 miles (110 km) from Denver, officials said.
The man was running on a trail when the juvenile cougar attacked him from behind, biting and clawing his face, back, legs and arms, state and local officials said in a joint statement late on Monday.
During the struggle, the man strangled the wild animal with his bare hands, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Rebecca Ferrell said by phone on Tuesday.
""There was some wrestling going on and the cat did latch onto his arm but he was able to choke it,"" she said.
The size of the cougar was unclear, Ferrell said, because other animals fed on the carcass before wildlife officers arrived. But it is believed it was a male.
The runner went to a hospital, officials said, with injuries that were serious but not life-threatening.
The remainder of the animal's body was recovered near the trail, where the jogger had dropped some possessions, and taken to a Colorado Parks and Wildlife lab for a necropsy, officials said.
""The runner did everything he could to save his life,"" said Mark Leslie, CPW Northeast Regional Manager. ""In the event of a lion attack, you need to do anything in your power to fight back, just as this gentleman did.""
Mountain lion attacks have caused fewer than 20 fatalities in the United States in the past 100 years. Sixteen known attacks have occurred in Colorado since 1990, officials said.

""Mountain lion attacks are not common in Colorado and it is unfortunate that the lion's hunting instincts were triggered by the runner,"" Ty Petersburg, area wildlife manager for the CPW, said in a statement. ""This could have had a very different outcome.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has sent food and medicine to Colombia's border with Venezuela, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, although it is still unclear how the aid will get past the objections of President Nicolas Maduro, who has blocked shipments in the past.
One official with knowledge of the plans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aid will be prepositioned at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta.
The U.S. officials said trucks carrying the aid, including high-protein foods, would arrive in Cucuta this week at the request of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself to be the South American nation's interim president.
Opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro told reporters in Caracas on Tuesday that Guaido's team would communicate the next steps on shipping the aid once it was in place.
Shipments were also coming from Venezuelan companies abroad, Colombia, Canada and Germany. Aid groups have asked authorities to allow the aid in, said Caritas, a Catholic aid group.
Prepositioning aid in warehouses or in truck convoys at border posts for weeks, or sometimes months, is common while officials negotiate safe passage.
Franklin Graham, chief executive of relief group Samaritan's Purse and the son of renowned Christian evangelist Billy Graham, said until humanitarian groups had access inside Venezuela, most aid likely would remain at the border.
""I don’t know how they’re going to do that, until the political situation changes,” said Graham, referring to the dilemma of how to get the aid inside Venezuela.
Samaritan's Purse has operated for the past three years in Cucuta, where food, medicine and backpacks are given to Venezuelans heading on foot into Colombia. The group also has managed to get a small amount of aid inside the country, which Graham called ""a drop in the bucket"" compared to what is needed.
""The government of Venezuela needs to open the borders, that's it: Open the borders and let food convoys come into your country, open up your airports and let food flights fly in,"" said Graham, who said he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump about the situation in December.
FLOW OF MIGRANTS
Pressure is growing on Maduro to step down after more than a dozen European Union nations, including Britain, Germany and France, on Monday joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
However Russia, China and Turkey continue to back Maduro, accusing Western nations of meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs.
The 35-year-old Guaido, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, has galvanized the opposition with a hopeful message. He has repeatedly called on Venezuela's military, which has remained loyal to Maduro, to support a transition to democracy.
The United States could attempt to seek the approval of the United Nations Security Council to deliver aid without Maduro's cooperation, but Russia would likely block such a move.
So far, Maduro has rejected foreign aid. ""We are not beggars. You want to humiliate Venezuela, and I will not let our people be humiliated,"" he said on Monday.
Maduro's government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations for recognizing Guaido, accusing them of submitting to a U.S. ""strategy to overthrow the legitimate government.""
The Cucuta crossing from Venezuela appeared to be quiet on Tuesday. The largest city along the frontier, Cucuta has borne the brunt of the arriving migrants. Thousands of people cross the pedestrian bridge daily lugging suitcases and plastic bags.
""Maduro doesn't want help,"" said Carolina Rozo, 20, as she crossed the bridge with a wheeled metal shopping cart. ""He wants us to be poor. We have to come to buy food because we cannot even get cooking oil and eggs in Venezuela.""
Those who settle in Cucuta are often Venezuela's poorest.
Others walk and bus hundreds of kilometers to other cities in Colombia, or follow thousands of others to Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina.
With Maduro in control of Venezuela's military and all the territory, getting aid in will be hard, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, who has led U.S. government responses to international disasters.

""If the goal here is to alleviate suffering, then you do need to be smart about dealing with the power structure that is in place,"" Konyndyk said.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Factbox: Guaido vs. Maduro - Who is backing Venezuela's two presidents,"(Reuters) - A slew of European nations this week joined the United States and other Western countries in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, heightening a global showdown over Nicolas Maduro's rule.
Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term was a sham and on Jan. 23 invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president, promising free and fair elections.
The 35-year-old has since won the support of many western nations although powerful countries such as Russia, China and Turkey continue to back Maduro and denounce what they call foreign meddling in Venezuela's domestic affairs.
Below is a summary of the support enjoyed by each leader. 
MADURO
- The top brass of Venezuela's military has shown no sign of leaving Maduro's side. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino has said Venezuela's armed forces disavow any self-proclaimed president.
- Russia and China, which are major investors in Venezuela's oil industry and significant creditors to the indebted government, have stood by Maduro and criticized U.S. interference. The two blocked a push for the United Nations Security Council to back Guaido.
- Turkey has also backed Maduro in contrast with its NATO allies while Iran has accused the United States of seeking ""world hegemony.""
- The Venezuelan Supreme Court, stacked with Maduro loyalists, has remained solidly behind the socialist leader, ruling last month that all actions taken by the congress - led by Guaido - are null and void.
- State oil company PDVSA, which accounts for most of Venezuela's export earnings, stood by Maduro. PDVSA President and Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, a career military officer, said on Jan. 31 that Guaido was ""a puppet"" of the United States.
- A few left-leaning governments in the region, including Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua, continue to back Maduro. Mexico, where leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office last year, has dropped the previous government's opposition to Maduro and said it will follow a policy of non-intervention.
- Both Mexico and Uruguay have called for dialogue between Venezuela's government and opposition for a resolution to the South American country's political crisis.
GUAIDO
- The United States recognized Guaido shortly after he proclaimed himself president, saying it would use its ""economic and diplomatic power"" to restore democracy in Venezuela.
- Numerous right-leaning Latin American governments, including Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, also recognized Guaido shortly thereafter.
- Britain, Germany, France and Spain and more than a dozen other members of the European Union recognized Guaido in a coordinated action on Feb. 4 following the expiration of an ultimatum they gave for Maduro to call a new presidential election.
- Australia, Canada, Israel and Morocco also recognize the young leader.
- There are some signs that support for the opposition is expanding beyond its traditional middle- and upper-class areas. Several protests against Maduro broke out in working-class neighborhoods last month, while many former Chavez and Maduro supporters have come out to opposition marches in the last 10 days.
- Some low-ranking military officers have expressed discontent with the government. The government on Jan. 21 said it suppressed a military revolt after a group of officers stole weapons, kidnapped officers, and demanded Maduro's removal.
- Air Force General Francisco Yanez became the first active general to openly recognize Guaido in a video that circulated on Feb. 2, although skeptics note Maduro had inflated the ranks of generals to as many as 2,000 during his rule.

- Yanez's defection came after that of Venezuela's top military envoy to the United States a week earlier.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis, whose papacy has been marked by efforts to quell a global crisis over sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy, said on Tuesday he was committed to stopping the abuse of nuns by priests and bishops, some of whom had used the women as sex slaves.
Francis made his comments on the plane returning from Abu Dhabi in response to a reporter's question about an article last week in a Vatican monthly magazine about the abuse of nuns in the Catholic Church. 
Recently more nuns, encouraged by the #MeToo movement, have been coming forward to describe abuse at the hands of priests and bishops. Last year, the International Union of Superiors General, which represents more than 500,000 Catholic nuns, urged their members to report abuse.
""It is true ... there have been priests and even bishops who have done this. I think it is still going on because something does not stop just because you have become aware of it,"" Francis said.
""We have been working on this for a long time. We have suspended some priests because of this,"" he said, adding that the Vatican was in the process of shutting down a female religious order because of sexual abuse and corruption. He did not name it.
""I can't say 'this does not happen in my house.' It is true. Do we have to do more? Yes. Are we willing? Yes,"" he said.
Francis said former Pope Benedict dissolved a religious order of women shortly after his election as pontiff in 2005 ""because slavery had become part of it (the religious order), even sexual slavery on the part of priests and the founder"".
He did not name the group but Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said it was a French order.
Before he became pope, Benedict was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican department that investigates sexual abuse. The pope at the time was John Paul.
Then-cardinal Ratzinger wanted to investigate the religious order where women were being abused but he was blocked, Francis said, without saying who prevented the probe.
After he became pope, Ratzinger reopened the investigation and dissolved the order, Francis said. 
Pope Francis has summoned key bishops from around the world to a summit later this month at the Vatican to find a unified response on how to protect children from sexual abuse by clergy. 

Asked if there would be some kind of similar action to confront abuse of nuns in the Church, he said: ""I want to move forward. We are working on it.""

The at time violent ""yellow vests"" protests have been a political thorn in President Emmanuel Macron's side since November as support among the French electorate for his reform agenda has ebbed.

Francis, who in the past has condemned the war in Yemen several times, made the comment in response to a question on the plane returning from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
""I spoke about it, but just with just a few people,"" Francis said when asked if he had discussed Yemen during his meeting with Crown Prince Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and other leaders. 
""I will say that I found good will to start peace processes,"" he said, without elaborating.
The nearly four-year-old war in Yemen, the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation, has killed tens of thousands of people and left almost 16 million people facing severe hunger. The conflict pits the Saudi-led coalition loyal to ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Iran-aligned Houthi group.

The United Nations is trying to implement a fragile ceasefire deal in the country's main Hodeidah port, a lifeline for millions and the site of some of the war's fiercest battles. It hopes the deal will pave the way for talks to end the war.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",Egyptian lawmakers pave way for Sisi to stay in power until 2034,"CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian parliamentary committee on Tuesday approved proposed constitutional amendments which would allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power until 2034 and boost his control of the judiciary.
The approval is the first step needed to move forward with the constitutional changes, which are expected to be finally endorsed by parliament and then move to a referendum within a few months. 
The proposed amendments were submitted on Sunday to the speaker of parliament who heads the committee that approved the changes. 
Any changes need approval by two-thirds of parliament members, followed by a referendum. 
""This is a constitution made for a pharaoh,"" said Mohamed Zaree of the Cairo Institute of Human Rights Studies. |""It gives [Sisi] a lot of authority with no accountability.""
Sisi supporters say the changes are necessary for the stability of the country and to give the president more time to implement economic development plans.
The amendments include an extension of the presidential term to six years from four in article 140 of the constitution, and a transitional clause that would reset the clock, potentially allowing Sisi to stay in power until 2034, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
The proposed changes also give Sisi new powers over appointing judges and the public prosecutor.
Critics say Sisi has led Egypt deeper into authoritarianism than former president Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in 2011 after ruling for three decades under a state of emergency.
They also include amending article 200 of the constitution to add that the military's duty is to protect ""the constitution and democracy and the fundamental makeup of the country and its civil nature."" Some critics fear these changes will give the military more influence on political life in Egypt.
Egypt’s military and intelligence services play an influential role in both political and economic spheres, and have been taking a more public role since current president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the 2013 military overthrow of Egypt’s first freely-elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
This could allow the armed forces to support one politician at the cost of another, said Talaat Khalil, one of 16 leftist lawmakers who held a news conference on Monday to denounce the proposed amendments.

""This is a big danger,"" he said.

It will now be discussed in the upper house, but the assembly has the last word.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. general warned on Tuesday that Islamic State would pose an enduring threat following a planned U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying the militant group retained leaders, fighters, facilitators and resources that will fuel a menacing insurgency.
The remarks by U.S. General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, represent the latest warning by current and former U.S. officials about the risk of a resurgence by Islamic State following a planned U.S. withdrawal from Syria ordered in December by President Donald Trump.
""We do have to keep pressure on this network. ... They have the ability of coming back together if we don't,"" Votel, who oversees troops in the Middle East as well as Afghanistan, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. He added that territory under Islamic State's control had been reduced to less than 20 square miles (52 square km) and would be recaptured by U.S.-backed forces prior to the U.S. withdrawal, which he said would be carried out in a ""deliberate and coordinated manner.""
Votel told the Senate hearing he was not consulted ahead of Trump's surprise decision to withdraw America's more than 2,000 troops from Syria, which helped trigger the resignation of his defense secretary, Jim Mattis.
Trump's Syria withdrawal has also fueled rare, vocal opposition from within his own Republican party.
The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Monday backed largely symbolic legislation that broke with Trump by opposing plans for any abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan.
It warned that ""a precipitous withdrawal"" could destabilize the region and create a vacuum that could be filled by Iran or Russia.
U.S. officials tell Reuters that the military has already started the withdrawal process, adding hundreds of troops to Syria to facilitate a safe pullout. It has begun to withdraw equipment from Syria and is expected to begin the drawdown of personnel soon. 
STATE OF THE UNION
Trump is expected to tout U.S. successes in Syria when he appears before a joint session of Congress to deliver a State of the Union speech at 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0200 GMT Wednesday).
A source close to Trump said the president will declare the militant group all but defeated and will discuss his planned Syria drawdown.
It is unclear whether Trump's triumphant tone will echo the warnings coming from different parts of his administration, including Votel's Central Command and the U.S. military. 
The Pentagon's own internal watchdog released a report on Monday saying Islamic State remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria.
""Absent sustained (counterterrorism) pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months and regain limited territory,"" the report from the Pentagon's inspector general said.
The report, citing information from U.S. Central Command, said Islamic State would portray the withdrawal as a ""victory"" and conduct attacks on American personnel during the pullout process.
A report by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Islamic State has transformed into a covert network, including in its strongholds of Syria and Iraq, but is still a threat with centralized leadership, up to $300 million at its disposal and thousands of fighters. 
The 18-page report to the U.N. Security Council, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, described Islamic State as ""by far the most ambitious international terrorist group, and the one most likely to conduct a large-scale, complex attack in the near future.""
It said the group was interested in attacking aviation and using chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials and that there were up to 18,000 Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreign fighters.

""Foreign terrorist fighters leaving the conflict zone, or prior returnees becoming active again on release from prison or for other reasons, will increase the threat,"" the report warned. ""Radicalized women and traumatized minors may also pose a serious threat.""

The demonstration outside the supreme court building in Khartoum was one of several staged by members of various professions, including teachers, doctors and pharmacists, following a call by the Sudanese Professionals Association to join the protests that began in December.
The demonstrations, often involving hundreds of people, have shaken the country of some 40 million people. They were sparked by rising food prices and cash shortages and have since turned against President Omar al-Bashir who has been in office for nearly 30 years.
Witnesses said more than 200 lawyers tried to deliver a petition to the head of the judiciary demanding the release of activists detained during the protests.
Security forces attacked the lawyers with tear gas, forcing them to disperse. There were no reports of casualties.
The incident happened a week after Sudan's information ministry said the country's security chief had ordered the release of detained demonstrators.
There were no reports of any mass release of detainees.
In central Khartoum, security forces used tear gas against hundreds of alumni students gathered at the main headquarters of Khartoum University, and at a separate gathering of school teachers who had staged a vigil outside the education ministry in Khartoum's northern section.
There were no reports of casualties.
Witnesses also said that doctors at several government hospitals organized protest vigils, but there were no reports of any force being used against them.
Bashir has shown no sign of being prepared to concede any authority and has blamed the protests on foreign agents, challenging his rivals to seek power through the ballot box.
Prime Minister Moataz Moussa struck a conciliatory tone last week, however, when he said that demonstrators' calls for better living conditions were ""legitimate"".
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges, which he denies, of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region. He has been lobbying to have Sudan removed from a list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism.
That listing has deterred the influx of investment and financial aid Sudan was hoping for when the United States lifted sanctions in 2017, economists say.

May, on a visit to Belfast on Tuesday, tried to reassure Northern Ireland that she can deliver an orderly Brexit that will ensure peace in a province riven by three decades of sectarian conflict until a 1998 accord.
The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has propped up May's government since she lost her parliamentary majority in a 2017 snap election, said it wanted to get a deal agreed but the border backstop had to be replaced.
""The current backstop, as I have said all along, is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland,"" DUP leader Arlene Foster, who will meet May in Belfast on Wednesday, told BBC radio.
Foster refused to say whether the deal would have to be renegotiated or whether she would accept legally binding assurances.
""If the backstop is dealt with in the withdrawal agreement then, despite the fact we may have misgivings around other parts of the withdrawal agreement, we will support the prime minister because we do want Brexit to happen in an orderly and sustained fashion,"" she said.
Britain, Ireland and the EU want to avoid physical checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland that ceased with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
IRISH BORDER
Where British soldiers once manned checkpoints in a reminder of Ireland's division, the border is now open with no controls since both the United Kingdom and Ireland are part of the EU.
But when the United Kingdom leaves the EU's Single Market and Customs Union the EU does not want the 310-mile (500-km) border to become a backdoor into the bloc without customs and regulatory checks.
As a way to prevent a hard border, Brussels and London agreed a so-called backstop - basically a promise that unless the sides come up with a better idea then the United Kingdom would remain bound by EU market and customs rules so that goods would not have to be checked.
The backstop is the most contentious part of the rejected deal in Britain. The DUP says it could endanger Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom, while Brexit supporters in May's Conservative Party worry it would lock the country into EU rules for the long term.
May told senior British ministers that she aimed to get changes that ensure the United Kingdom could not be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.
The EU will not renegotiate the divorce deal and the Irish backstop but alternatives could be worked on after Britain leaves, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday.
There is little appetite for a no-deal Brexit in the EU. As Brussels waits for Britain to set out its plans, diplomats and officials in the rest of the EU are increasingly expecting a delay to Brexit, due to take place on March 29.

""It could only be a few weeks, until late May or early July. And not that we know that it would get us anywhere. But it would buy us some time,"" said an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit.

The presenter and reporter, both males in their 20s, died at the scene, said Semin Hussaini, director of Radio Hamsada. 
It was not known if they were on air at the time and both police and Hussaini said they no idea of the motive for the attack in Taloqan, capital of the northern province of Takhar.
Theirs was the second killing of journalists in Afghanistan this year. Last month the Taliban kidnapped and later killed government worker and part-time journalist Javid Noori.
Jawad Hejri, spokesman for the Takhar governor, said the gunmen fled without being identified and police were investigating.
Taliban and other Islamist insurgents have repeatedly targeted Afghan journalists, killing 15 in 2018, the deadliest year yet for the country's media, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The Paris-based media rights group said the three most dangerous countries for journalists to work in were Afghanistan, Syria and Mexico.

Without responding directly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nevertheless said it was important to block Iranian influence in Syria.
Israel, which views Tehran as its biggest security threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets and those of allied militia in Syria. With an election looming in April, Israel has been increasingly open about carrying out air strikes.
In a meeting with Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem in Tehran, the secretary of Iran's National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said the Israeli attacks violated Syria's territorial integrity and were unacceptable.
""If these actions continue, we will activate some calculated measures as a deterrent and as a firm and appropriate response to teach a lesson to the criminal and lying rulers of Israel,"" Shamkhani was quoted as saying by Fars news agency.
In Jerusalem, Netanyahu said he would hold talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 21, focussing on Iran's threat along the Syrian border. 
Moscow is a main backer of the Damascus government.
""It's very important that we continue to prevent Iran from entrenching in Syria. In many ways we blocked that advance. But we are committed to continuously blocking it, continuously preventing Iran from creating another war front against us right here opposite the Golan Heights,"" Netanyahu said.
In January, Israeli warplanes carried out a strike on what they called an Iranian arms cache in Syria, and Netanyahu has said attacks will continue.
Syria's Moualem was quoted on Tuesday by a Hezbollah-run media unit as saying: ""The Syrian government considers it to be its duty to keep Iranian security forces in Syrian territory.""
Iran has also repeatedly said it will keep forces there.

Moualem was in Tehran for negotiations before the meeting of the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Russian Black Sea resort town Sochi on Feb. 14 about the situation in Syria.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors in the U.S. trial of accused Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman began their second day of deliberations in a federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday.
Guzman, 61, is accused of leading Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, which became one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. He twice escaped from prison in Mexico, and will face the possibility of life in a U.S. prison if convicted.
The 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named for the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village. 
Prosecutors said he trafficked tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.
The defense argued that Guzman was set up as a ""fall guy"" by Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large.
The 12 jurors began deliberating on Monday afternoon after receiving instructions from U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan. They are seven women and five men whose names have not been disclosed for security reasons. 
At least three jurors are immigrants, three are Spanish speakers and several have ties to law enforcement. 
Almost all of them had heard of Guzman before the trial began, but said they could be impartial. The only exception was a woman from Ethiopia who said she had ""no clue"" who he was.
The jury sent the judge two notes with legal questions on Monday afternoon. 
In the first, they asked whether a ""drug war"" could be considered ""part of a drug trafficking crime with specific reference to the weapons charge."" Jurors heard extensive testimony about deadly wars between Guzman and rival drug traffickers during the trial.
One of the 10 criminal counts Guzman faces is that he used weapons in furtherance of his drug crimes. Cogan told the jury they could not consider the weapons charge until they had found Guzman guilty of one of four drug-related counts. He said they were free to consider evidence of drug wars while weighing those counts. 
In the second note, the jury asked whether ""ephedrine is considered methamphetamine.""

Witnesses in the case testified that ephedrine is one of the ingredients used to make methamphetamine. Cogan told the jurors that they would have to refer to the evidence in the case.

Major European countries on Monday joined most members of the Lima Group, including Argentina, Brazil and Canada, supporting Guaido as interim Venezuelan leader and calling for free elections.
Mexico was once an outspoken critic of Maduro. But ties with Venezuela have warmed under leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month.
Lopez Obrador's government has said it is following a policy of neutrality and non-intervention.

Maduro's government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations, saying their move would affect relations with Caracas.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania's intelligence agencies fear Russia will interfere in its forthcoming elections, including one in May to find a successor to the staunchly anti-Kremlin president, Dalia Grybauskaite.
The Baltic state, ruled from Moscow for much of the 20th century but now a member of both the European Union and NATO, was rattled by Russia's annexation of Crimea, and hosts a German-led multinational battalion to deter any Russian invasion. It holds presidential, municipal and European Parliament elections this year and a parliamentary election in 2020.
""Russian intelligence will step up its activity during the 2019-2020 election cycle,"" the agencies wrote in a joint annual assessment published on Tuesday. ""It is possible that Russia will seek to sway the course of the elections by information and cyber means.""
Moscow could ""disseminate propaganda and disinformation in Lithuanian social media"", it said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the suggestion was ""absolute nonsense"", adding: ""Russia does not interfere in elections in other countries.""
Russia is also suspected of carrying out a number of notable cyber attacks, including a concerted assault on the information systems of another Baltic state, Estonia, in 2007, and an attack that knocked out power stations in Ukraine in 2016. Russia denies being behind any cyber attack.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating allegations of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump to help him win the U.S. presidential election in 2016 - allegations that both sides deny.
The Lithuanian report said Russia was basing more tanks and bombers in the Kaliningrad enclave, which borders Lithuania and Poland, and upgrading its bases there to be able to deploy missiles including the nuclear-capable Iskander.
The report also said there was a growing risk of ""unintentional incidents"" from increased military maneuvers on the other side of the Russian-Lithuanian border.
The agencies said they had observed Russian intelligence targeting people in Lithuania's energy sector and trying to hack into control systems to gain the ability to disrupt Lithuania's electricity supply.
""This is far from our priority,"" the Kremlin's Peskov said. ""Recently, in Kaliningrad, Putin opened a gas liquefaction plant, which guaranteed Kaliningrad's self-sufficiency in energy.""
Lithuania is expanding its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Klaipeda and, together with fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia, reducing its dependence on Russian energy.

AMMAN (Reuters) - A U.N. special envoy told warring Yemenis on Tuesday that rapid implementation of a prisoner swap deal would help advance efforts at a political settlement of a nearly four-year-old war.
The envoy, Martin Griffiths, said finalising a list of the thousands of prisoners should be completed by the end of three days of talks in Amman between teams from the Saudi-backed government and their Iranian-aligned Houthi adversaries. 
The list is to be handed over to the world body and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
""It will lay the basis for the next step which will be to see that release happening,"" Griffiths told delegates before the start of the second round in Amman in less than a month.
Griffiths stressed how important the swap deal was to achieving progress in ending a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left 15.9 million people facing severe hunger.
""Success in this regard is not only of huge importance for those who will be released.. but also for the broader political process in which we have hopes the parties will together resolve the issues that divide them and return Yemen to peace.""
As he spoke, the new head of the U.N. mission tasked with overseeing a fragile ceasefire deal in Yemen, Danish Major General Michael Anker Lollesgaard, arrived in the port city of Hodeidah.
Implementation of the deal, reached in Sweden in December, has stalled as the two sides cannot agree on who will control the port - a lifeline for millions of Yemenis - and the city after a planned redeployment of their forces.
CONFIDENCE-BUILDING
The prisoner swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at the peace talks in Sweden.
The Amman prisoner negotiations will verify names of about 15,000 prisoners exchanged by both sides, some of whom include Saudis and other nationals fighting on the government side.
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), whose agency would oversee the operation, said implementing the deal could take weeks and involve the repatriation of third country nationals. 
""Trust doesn't come from one day to another. It is a difficult process and we know this is work in progress,"" ICRC President Peter Maurer said at the start of the Amman talks.
The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been bogged down in a military stalemate for years.
A Sunni Muslim Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014.

The Houthis control most urban centers in the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation while Hadi's government controls the southern port of Aden and a string of coastal towns.

YELENOVSKOYE, Russia (Reuters) - The last contact Grigoriy Gancherov and his wife had with their son, a Russian private military contractor fighting in Syria, was on Feb. 4 last year.
The father subsequently learned from a friend and fellow fighter of Sergei's that the 25-year-old had died several days later in a major battle against U.S.-led forces in the Deir al-Zor region.
    It was not until mid-April that he received formal notification of his son's death and the body was returned, accompanied by a death certificate stating he died on March 7 on the other side of Syria.
    Gancherov's account is one of half a dozen instances Reuters has identified where the Kremlin-linked private military organization that recruited the fighters returned bodies more than seven weeks after the battle and with official documents bearing details that people who knew them say were incorrect.
    According to relatives and a battlefield witness, the fighters all died in the clash in Syria's Deir al-Zor region, which took place overnight on Feb. 7.
    Such practices, an unusual pattern for Russian fighters killed in Syria, would have helped conceal heavy casualties until after President Vladimir Putin’s re-election in mid-March.
    Moscow's message at the time was that the military campaign in Syria was a success with only modest human cost. 
    That details are emerging nearly a year after the Deir al-Zor battle indicates that Moscow may struggle to control its message about casualties abroad at a time when it is expanding its military activities in the Middle East and Africa.
    
    NEW GRAVESTONE
About 100 Russian military contractors were killed in the Deir al-Zor battle, sources have said. The Russian foreign ministry has said that only a handful of Russian citizens were killed there and dismissed reports of heavy losses.
    Sergei Gancherov and his friend were standing near each other shortly before their position was hit, according to the account the friend gave to the father.
    The friend, who was wounded, told the father he learned about Gancherov's death on a medical evacuation plane on his way back to Russia.
    Reuters was unable to speak to the friend or verify his account.
    Grigoriy Gancherov plans to replace the wooden cross that bears the date recorded in his son's official death certificate with a gravestone marked with the date of the Deir al-Zor battle.
    That was the first direct confrontation between the United States and Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was also the only known battle in Syria in the early part of last year where Russian military contractors took part.
    Yet in each of the six instances identified by Reuters where fighters were returned to families after the election, the death certificates, issued by Russian officials in Syria, stated they died in late February or March.
    Several relatives of those fighters said the recruiters who informed them about their family member's death told them not to disclose the circumstances.
    The Kremlin declined to comment on Gancherov's death or that of the other fighters. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was wrong to suggest authorities postponed issuing death certificates of Russians killed in Syria because of the election.
    On whether death certificates issued by Russian officials contained incorrect information, Peskov said it wasn't a question for the Kremlin. He added that he didn't know whether there was a delay in returning the bodies.
    The defense ministry and the ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
    As Reuters has reported, Russia secretly used private military contractors in Syria to carry out missions in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Moscow's ally, in coordination with the Russian military.
    The organization that recruited the fighters, known as Wagner group, uses defense ministry transport infrastructure and hospitals. Russia denies using military contractors in Syria and says any Russian civilians there are volunteers.
    Peskov could not confirm whether the Wagner group operates in Syria or carries out missions on behalf of the Russian government.
A person Reuters understands to be close to the Wagner group commander did not respond to requests for comment.
HUGE AIR ASSAULT
On Feb. 7 last year, Russian fighters advanced toward an oil refinery in Deir al-Zor province held by Kurdish forces and the U.S.-led coalition, which responded with heavy air strikes.
    A military contractor who said he survived by taking cover identified among the many dead he saw two of the six fighters who were returned to families after the election with official documents bearing later dates of death.
    Colleagues told him the delay was because of the large number of deaths and because journalists were monitoring an airport in Rostov-on-Don, in southern Russia, which was a key staging post for the private military firm.
    ""It was difficult to deliver all of them at once because reporters were waiting for them in Rostov, meeting planes, as we were told,"" said the fighter.
    He said he did not want to be identified because his recruiters did not allow him to disclose information related to his assignment in Syria.
    Reuters reporters spent several days after the February battle monitoring a military morgue and airport in Rostov. They did not see coffins arriving.
    According to the fighter, one of the dead colleagues he saw was Anton Vazhov from the southern Russian town of Novoshakhtinsk, whose official records say he died on March 21.
    He said he saw Vazhov in a body bag on Feb. 8 upon returning to the battlefield after the air strikes to collect the dead.
    ""When we turned him over on his back and blew away the dust, we identified him,"" the fighter said, adding that he drove Vazhov away from the battlefield in the back of a truck with more than 20 other bodies.
    FEAR OF REPRISALS
    In the region of Kirov, 800 km north-east of Moscow, lie the graves of three fighters whose bodies were returned to families in early April, according to people who knew them.
    The fighter who survived the battle said one of the three men, Alexander Lusnikov, was also among the dead he collected from the Deir al-Zor battlefield.
    Lusnikov's official records indicate he died on March 1, according to a relative who has viewed the death certificate.
    Another relative, Viktor Dumin, the brother of Lusnikov's ex-wife, said the fighter told him about the circumstances of the death.
    ""Once the president had been elected, it all came to light,"" Dumin told Reuters at the cemetery where Lusnikov is buried.
    Neither of the two other military contractors - Alexei Kalabukhov and Konstantin Danilogorsky – had contacted their families since the battle, a childhood friend said. After learning about the battle, their wives tried to contact them but couldn’t reach them, the friend added.
    Their graves say they died on Feb. 27 – the date the death certificates carry, according to a person familiar with the details.
The brother of another fighter from a town in the western part of Russia said he learned about his sibling's death in Deir al-Zor in mid-February from an acquaintance in touch with the contractors in Syria, even though the death certificate said he died weeks later.
He asked not to mention their names saying he feared reprisals.
    
    SURGE IN REGISTERED DEATHS
    The belated return of bodies and incorrect documents described by friends and relatives last spring contrasts to the normal sequence observed by Reuters over a period of two years.
Typically, recruiters return a body to a family two or three weeks after a death, accompanied by a death certificate bearing a date of death that usually tallies with what relatives know from fellow fighters. 
    The Russian consulate in Syria is responsible for registering the death of Russian civilians killed in the country. Each death certificate carries a serial number, starting from one at the beginning of the year.
    Russian officials at the consulate issued more than 60 death certificates in the first part of last year through April 8, according to documents seen by Reuters. At least 33 of those were between March 22 and April 8. The election was on March 18.

    The Russian consulate in Syria didn't respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to establish whether all those certificates were for private military contractors.

BAYONNE, France (Reuters) - In the Basque Country town of Bayonne, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, French police are struggling to stem a growing flow of migrants crossing the snow-capped mountains that straddle the border between France and Spain.
Spain became a major entry point for Africans fleeing war and poverty after a populist government took power in Italy early last year and largely shut down ports to migrants.
More than 58,000 migrants landed in Spain by boat in 2018, according to the International Organization for Migration, nearly triple the previous year and eclipsing for the first time the numbers passing through North Africa to Italy.
Many head north and cross the French frontier hidden in trucks, riding buses or on foot, crossing mountains whose highest peak rises to 3,400 meters (11,000 feet) and where winter temperatures often fall below zero.
""My colleagues are professionals but they become despondent when they run searches, take migrants back over the border, only for them to re-enter. It's like emptying an ocean with a spoon,"" said Patrice Peyruqueou, a police official in France's southwestern Pyrenees-Atlantiques region. 
Lack of resources meant police could not monitor all border crossing points around-the-clock, Peyruqueou added.
""SAVING MY SKIN""
The European Union has struggled to resolve tensions among member states over migration policy, even as overall numbers arriving from Africa and the Middle East have declined sharply.
With Spain a flashpoint, Bayonne, 40 km (25 miles) north of the border, is grappling with a humanitarian situation that is stretching the town's finances and pitting mayor Jean-Rene Etchegaray against the local interior ministry representative.
In the New Year, Etchegaray asked the local prefect for funds to help finance the running of a reception center dubbed ""La Pausa"" where up to 150 migrants at any one time can rest for three days, receiving food handouts and donated clothes.
But the interior ministry's then local prefect, Gilbert Payet, refused support for the center, arguing it helped encourage the movement of migrants across France.
Etchegaray was stunned. ""It's a question of humanity,"" he told a local radio station.
Somali teenager Mokhtar fled his homeland 18 months ago, but not before a policeman shot the 18-year-old in the thigh and then his lower leg after word got around he intended to leave.
""He said that would make it harder for me to run,"" Mokhtar recounted. ""I left to save my own skin.""
The youngster followed a route increasingly used by human traffickers, crossing the Sahara desert to Libya before heading west along the coast to Morocco then making a perilous traverse of the Straits of Gibraltar. He then wound his way north through Spain before reaching the French border.
""I don't know how many times they took me back to the Spanish side,"" he said. Eventually, a motorist helped him cross. Now he dreams of a normal life.

""Just the other day,"" he said, ""I had toothache and for the first time in my life I was taken to a dentist.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Politicians and campaigners are urging Germany to use the lessons of its own reunification to help bring North and South Korea together, but Berlin is in no rush to take up the challenge. 
A second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un planned for later this month has raised hopes for lasting peace on a peninsula divided since war there ended in a truce more than 65 years ago.
Reflecting that optimism, diplomats, politicians and foreign policy experts say Germany, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, should be exploring back channels for talks, offering advice on treaty negotiations, and promoting dialogue. But instead, in their opinion, it is falling short.
""Germany has a special role to play. Germany and the city of Berlin are for most Koreans symbols of reunification,"" said South Korea's ambassador to Germany, Jong Bum Goo.
""Our government wants to integrate North Korea into the international community but in my view the German government is still rather passive on this,"" Jong told Reuters. 
Despite this, some former leaders of Communist East Germany, Berlin's Free University, some parliamentarians, and civil society groups are engaging with North Korea to share the lessons of German reunification nearly 30 years ago.
While nobody is seriously talking about a German-style reunification in Korea, a thaw could lead to a peace deal that would usher in stability in North East Asia.
A senior South Korean diplomat in Seoul told Reuters that the government had not made any specific request of Berlin and was ""grateful for Germany's ongoing support for inter-Korean reconciliation"".
However, many experts agree that Germany, one of the few countries with diplomatic relations with North and South Korea and also with personal contacts in Pyongyang dating back to Communist East German times, is being stubborn.
Hans Modrow, the last Communist leader of East Germany, who took the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung on a boat trip down the Elbe in 1984, maintains an active interest, and visited both Koreas in September to discuss reunification.
The spritely 91-year-old was scathing about Chancellor Angela Merkel's Korea policy. 
""The U.S. president can have talks with the top man in North Korea but the Germans can't even have their foreign minister have direct contact,"" Modrow told Reuters. 
""To achieve peace and security in Korea, we need more engagement,"" said Modrow. 
Others agree.
""I would like a bit more courage from the German foreign ministry so that Germany, as a reunited country, claims a special status and supports dialogue and exchange,"" said Nataly Jung-Hwa Han, head of the Berlin-based Korea Association, which promotes understanding of North Korea.
Nobody was available at North Korea's embassy in Berlin
Germany's stance reflects its reluctance to assume a global role since the end of World War Two. 
Foreign policy, which Merkel stresses is based on multilateralism, is embedded in that of the European Union and tends to follow the U.S. line. On North Korea, this means joining sanctions aimed at getting it to end its nuclear program. 
INSPIRATION
The criticism of Germany comes 18 months after South Korean President Moon Jai-in came to Berlin to appeal for support. 
""The end of the Cold War that started in Berlin will be completed in Pyongyang and Seoul, the new peace vision for North East Asia and worldwide will be implemented,"" he said in 2017.
Last October, Moon visited Europe again, seeking support for possibly easing sanctions against North Korea once it makes progress on denuclearization. 
But his summit with the EU, in which Germany holds sway, failed to reach agreement. 
""Our position was there's a need for sanctions relief under the premise that denuclearization is realized,"" the South Korean diplomat in Seoul said, adding the EU agreed in principle but insisted sanctions stay until North Korea takes concrete action.
Merkel has pledged to promote a peaceful solution of North Korean nuclear issues, but no action has followed.
""Deeds must follow words,"" said a German-Korean youth forum which met in Daejeon in South Korea in October, adding there was big potential for Germany, and the EU, to play a consultative and mediatory role.
So far, moves toward Korean reconciliation have brought three summits, a military agreement to defuse tensions and more family reunions.
Joint North-South participation in last year's Winter Olympics in the South has been followed by economic, cultural and personal exchanges. 
This resonates among Germans whose reunification followed two decades of rapprochement, initiated by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
""You would think it would be a long-term German policy to support a Korean solution,"" said Bernt Berger, head of the Asia program at the DGAP think-tank in Berlin.
""It's tragic because South Korea really wants German support as they think it would understand the situation and be able to help find solutions,"" said Berger. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas visited South Korea in July, stopping at the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas to underline German support for reconciliation.
The foreign ministry said it was ready in principle to look at possible support for reconciliation but stressed this must be driven by the two Koreas.
""The top priority on North Korea is the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,"" said a ministry official, adding that while Germany does have a special role, EU coordination was important.
NO MODEL
Regardless of what their government does, interest is growing among Germans who recall East Germans pouring through the Berlin Wall and destroying the most potent symbol of the Cold War without a shot being fired.
Academic institutions see potential for cooperation. Berlin's Free University and the Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang signed a letter of intent to cooperate in social sciences in September.
The Berlin Wall Foundation, the Goethe Institute and South Korean game developer Nolgong unveiled an interactive game in January to encourage players to learn about Germany's split and reunification and about Korea's war and division.
But the main recommendation from Berlin is that Korea should not to copy Germany where after three decades, and transfers of about 2 trillion euros from West to East, inequalities persist.
""I stress Germany should not be a model,"" Modrow said, adding it was essential to help North Korea catch up economically to avoid consequences similar to the rise of the far-right in Germany.
The South Korean ambassador sees two lessons from Germany for Korea: change will come via reconciliation, and reunification is complicated but worth pursuing. 
""We think of the words of Brandt - what belongs together will grow together. We still believe that,"" he said.

COX'S BAZAR (Reuters) - U.N. refugee agency special envoy Angelina Jolie on Tuesday visited camps in Bangladesh for Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and condemned the world's failure to prevent a crisis that saw 730,000 people driven from their homes.
The Hollywood actor addressed a crowd of refugees on a hilltop in Kutapalong camp, the world’s largest refugee settlement, in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district.
She said was ""humbled and proud to stand with you today"".
""You have every right not to be stateless and the way you have been treated shames us all,"" said Jolie, adding the crisis was the result of decades of discrimination that had gone unaddressed. 
""What is most tragic about this situation is that we cannot say we had no warning.""
Jolie's visit came as the United Nations said it was preparing to launch a new appeal for $920 million to support the refugees, who fled a brutal military crackdown in neighboring Rakhine state in Myanmar in response to militant attacks in August 2017.
U.N. investigators have accused Myanmar’s army of carrying out mass killings and rapes with ""genocidal intent"" during the massive offensive that laid waste to hundreds of Rohingya villages in the western Rakhine state.
Myanmar denies the charge and says its offensive was a legitimate response to an insurgent threat and has pledged to welcome the refugees back.
But the United Nations says conditions are not yet right for return. The Rohingya say they want guarantees over their safety and to be recognized as citizens before returning.
Jolie said she had met stateless Rohingya who described being ""treated like cattle"" in Myanmar.
""I met a woman yesterday, a survivor of rape in Myanmar, and she told me 'you would have to shoot me where I stand before I would go back to Myanmar',"" Jolie said.
""I urge the Myanmar authorities to show the genuine commitment needed to end the cycle of violence, displacement, and improve conditions for all communities in Rakhine state, including the Rohingya.""
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not pick up a call seeking comment.
Jolie flew to Bangladesh this week to ""assess the humanitarian needs of the Rohingya refugees and some of the more critical challenges facing Bangladesh as a host country"", the UNHCR said in a statement.
She will meet Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen in the capital, Dhaka, on Wednesday, the refugee agency said.
Several refugees who gathered to watch Jolie speak said they knew only that she was a “high official”.
But 22-year-old Mohammed Shakir, who fled his home in Rakhine after the 2017 violence, said he respected her for her humanitarian work. 

“When I saw her, I was very excited because she has special words for our Rohingya,” he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will race to develop two new land-based missile launch systems before 2021 to respond to Washington's planned exit from a landmark nuclear arms control pact, it said on Tuesday.
President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that Russia had suspended the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which bans both nations from stationing short- and intermediate-range land-based missiles in Europe.
Moscow and Washington accuse each other of violating the treaty and Putin said Russia had acted after the United States announced it was withdrawing from the pact.
Washington had made clear it planned to start research, development and design work on new missile systems and Moscow would do the same, Putin said. 
The Russian military should start work on creating land-based launch systems for an existing ship-launched cruise missile, the Kalibr, and for longer-range hypersonic missiles which travel at least five times the speed of sound, he said. 
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday ordered work to begin on developing the new systems.
Shoigu, a close Putin ally, said he wanted the work completed by the end of next year so the new systems were ready by 2021.
""From Feb. 2, the United States suspended its obligations under the INF treaty,"" Shoigu told a meeting of defense chiefs. 
""At the same time they are actively working to create a land-based missile with a range of more than 500 km which is outside the treaty's limits. President Putin has given the defense ministry the task of taking symmetrical measures."" 
Moscow denies flouting the 1987 pact. It says Washington is the one violating it and has accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty it wanted to leave anyway in order to develop new missiles. Washington denies that.
U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on Tuesday that the United States would reconsider its withdrawal from the INF treaty ""should Russia return to full and verifiable compliance.""

""This is Russia's final opportunity to return to compliance,"" Wood said.

Libyan authorities allowed municipal elections in 2013 in a bid to end a decades-long legacy of centralization of administration and help communities manage their local affairs. 
But degradation of security conditions after the toppling of long-ruling Muammar Qaddafi and irregular funding hindered the process. 
Holding elections to renew the municipal councils requires at least 50 million Libyan dinars ($36 million), Salem Bentahia, head of the Central Committee for Municipal Councils Elections told Reuters in an interview.
For now, the committee has only received 30 percent of that budget, he said.
Without government funds the committee is unable to launch awareness raising programs on the importance of municipal elections, Bentahia said.
Officials at the internationally recognized government in Tripoli were not immediately available for comment.
Constituency registration has been reopened with more than 800,000 voters on the list including 504,136 women, according to official figures.
The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) called on the government to provide the necessary funding for the municipal council votes to take place. 
UNSMIL along with the United Nations Development Programme have been offering technical and logistical support to the elections committee since March 2018. 
The oil-rich country plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising that toppled Qaddafi in 2011.
The country has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.

SYDNEY/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday he was ""disturbed"" to see Bahraini refugee footballer Hakeem Al Araibi in shackles in Thailand and had told its prime minister this was a serious issue for Australians. 
Pressure is mounting on Bangkok to free Araibi, who was arrested in Thailand in November on behalf of the Bahraini government, with Canberra and soccer's world governing body FIFA demanding his return to Australia where he plays.
Araibi, who fled Bahrain in 2014 before being granted permanent residence in Australia, has said he would face torture if sent back to Bahrain for his criticism of the royal family.
Morrison said he was ""disturbed"" to see Araibi with shackles on his feet arrive at a Bangkok court on Monday. The court extended his detention for two months.
""I thought that was very upsetting and I know it would have upset many Australians, and I respectfully reminded the Thai prime minister that Australians feel very strongly about this,"" Morrison told Sky News.
""So we will continue to make these representations and not just to Thailand, but also to Bahrain,"" he added.
Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, leader of the junta, said on Tuesday his government could not intervene in the court proceedings.
""Do not jump to conclusion about the verdict and do not politicize this,"" Prayuth told reporters.
Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said Australia and Bahrain should negotiate a solution.
""We don't have a stake in this and it's a matter that the two countries need to talk,"" Don told reporters.
""If they can't find a solution, then Thailand is ready to mediate. I am sure things will not escalate, but for now Hakeem will be under the care of Thai authorities."" 
Araibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia.
He denies wrongdoing, saying he was playing in a televised soccer match at the time.
Araibi was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, New York-based Human Rights Watch has said.
Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.
Phil Robertson, the group's deputy Asia director, said Araibi's return to Australia ""is an open and shut case.""
""Everybody seems to realize that except the Thai government,"" he told Reuters.
Many Thais, including former deputy prime minister Chaturon Chaisang, have called for Araibi's release, making the hashtag #SaveHakeem the top trending Thai item on Twitter on Monday. 
Thai soccer team Chiang Rai United have also joined the campaign to free Araibi, who played for Melbourne's second tier Pascoe Vale soccer club.

Football Federation Australia have ramped up their campaign to free Araibi and pledged A$10,000 ($7,263) on Tuesday to kickstart a fundraising drive to help return him to Australia.

""There is no satisfactory plan that is put before us concretely yet,"" Erdogan told a parliamentary meeting of his AK Party. ""Of course we are loyal to our agreements, our promise is a promise. But our patience is not limitless.""
Turkey wants to set up the safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia which Ankara considers a terrorist group.
Erdogan said that Turkey did not need not have to ask anyone for permission to implement its own plans in the area. ""No threat can make us turn from this path, including a sanctions list,"" he said.
The safe zone will be an issue at a meeting on Wednesday in the United States of ministers from a coalition of countries fighting the Islamic State militant group. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will attend those talks.
In December, Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring that Islamic State had been defeated there.
Erdogan also said on Tuesday that Turkey would only wait a few weeks for militants to be removed from the north Syrian town of Manbij. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is spearheaded by the YPG, has controlled Manbij since 2016.
After months of disagreement, Ankara and Washington agreed in June on a roadmap that would see the YPG removed from the town. Turkey has repeatedly expressed its frustration that the implementation of the plan has been delayed.

Trump has warned Turkey not to attack Kurdish fighters in Syria and last month threatened economic devastation if Ankara attacked the YPG militia.

HARARE (Reuters) - Some Zimbabwean teachers stayed at home while others went slow on the job as a strike at state schools got off to a patchy start amid fears of further intimidation by security forces who cracked down hard on last month's protests. 
Zimbabwe is grappling with an economic crisis marked by cash shortages and rising prices of basic goods after President Emmerson Mnangagwa hiked fuel costs 150 percent last month. 
That brought demonstrations and looting, plus a brutal response from security agents, which rights groups say left 12 people dead. Police put the figure at three. 
In schools near central Harare, most teachers appeared to have turned up for work, but some were not conducting lessons in adherence with the strike, witnesses said. 
In a classroom at a primary school in Harare's Mbare township, a Reuters photographer saw one teacher eating from her lunch box in the morning while pupils sat quietly. 
She and the headmistress declined to be interviewed.
""Stay home, be safe. Don't be intimidated by police and CIOs (Central Intelligence Organisation),"" the Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA), the biggest teachers' union, said in a circular to members.
Zimbabwe has more than 100,000 public sector teachers.
The Bulawayo-based online news site, Centre for Innovation and Technology, said teachers at several schools in the country's second biggest city did not turn up for work and parents had to collect their children.
""Some teachers are in class but there is no meaningful teaching going on,"" ZIMTA president Richard Gundane told Reuters.
Government workers are demanding wage rises and payments in U.S. dollars to cope with soaring inflation and an economic crisis that has sapped supplies of fuel and medicines. 
Many Zimbabweans, who have seen purchasing power eroded despite adopting the dollar in 2009, say Mnangagwa has not delivered on pre-election pledges to kick-start growth after the exit of Robert Mugabe in 2017.
Despite their demands for better pay, other public workers declined to join teachers on strike because they are fearful of the volatile security situation and want to continue negotiations with the government.
Economic hardships have seen the government allowing nurses to work just three days a week because they do not have enough money for bus fares, the nurses union said on Tuesday.
The government has pleaded with teachers' unions to give talks a chance, saying children will be prejudiced.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An alliance of regional parties in India is working on a combined economic plan, one of its leaders said, in the latest sign that Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces an increasingly united opposition in the upcoming general election. 
That plan is likely to include a landmark policy floated by India’s main opposition Congress party to provide the poor with a minimum income if it wins polls due by May, N Chandrababu Naidu, the politician who helped forge the common front, told Reuters in an interview. 
The alliance – consisting of 23 parties that came together in a giant rally in Kolkata last month – would focus on poverty eradication, agriculture, employment and a “minimum income for every family”, he added. 
""So many political parties are working (on a) consensus. The farmers' crisis is the biggest issue, unemployment is the biggest issue,” Naidu said. ""The economy (is where) you have to concentrate”.
Modi's ratings have dropped to their lowest-ever level amid discontent over a lack of jobs for young people and a weak farm economy, according to an India Today poll last month. 
Polls have also forecast his ruling alliance will fall short of a majority in the election, which could potentially allow a coalition of regional parties to take a shot at coming to power. 
However, there are questions over who could lead the opposition alliance, or whether regional parties would be open to supporting Congress chief Rahul Gandhi should his party emerge with a significant number of seats. 
""A prime minister will be decided afterwards with consensus,"" Naidu said, ruling out selecting a figurehead before the polls. ""First of all we have to win the elections.""
As chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Naidu has been credited with implementing business-friendly polices that attracted firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to the southern state. 
His Telugu Desam Party, one of the largest regional parties in India's parliament, was part of a coalition led by Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) till last March, when he broke away after disagreements over funding for Andhra Pradesh. 
Since then, he has emerged as one of the main architects of an informal alliance seeking to unseat the BJP.

“I’m telling you anybody is better than Narendra Modi because he won’t listen to anybody,” Naidu said. “He doesn’t have any comprehensive position.”

The nomination still must be ratified by Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who last year refused to let Savona become economy minister, fearing his anti-euro views could undermine Italy's international standing and upset financial markets.
However, a source in the president's office said Mattarella had no objection to Savona, 82, taking the Consob post.
The top Consob job has been vacant since last September when the then-president, Mario Nava, resigned under pressure from the League and 5-Star because of his continued ties to the European Commission, where he had previously worked.
However, the two coalition parties have struggled to find a compromise candidate and Mattarella last week shot down a proposal that economist Marcello Minenna should take the post.
Newspapers have reported that Minenna, who is seen as close to 5-Star, is likely to become Consob secretary general.

If Savona gets the job, there was no immediate indication of who might replace him as EU affairs minister. A political source said Savona was frustrated by the position because it had only a limited budget and little effective power.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Catholics and several thousand Muslims attended an unprecedented public celebration of Mass on Tuesday by Pope Francis, the first pontiff in history to visit the Arabian Peninsula.
More than 120,000 worshippers packed Zayed Sports City stadium and its surroundings in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, to see the pope, who is in the Gulf country to promote inter-faith dialogue.
The UAE hosts about half of the two million expatriate Catholics living on the peninsula, home to the birthplace of Islam in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The community includes large numbers of people from the Philippines and India.
""It is most certainly not easy for you to live far from home, missing the affection of your loved ones, and perhaps also feeling uncertainty about the future,"" the pope said, telling those gathered to draw inspiration from Saint Anthony the Abbot, the founder of monasticism in the desert.
""The Lord specializes in doing new things; he can even open paths in the desert,"" he said at the end of a trip where he met with the grand imam of Egypt's Al-Azhar mosque and UAE leaders.
Francis entered the stadium in a white open top jeep to roars from the crowd. People wearing white baseball caps emblazoned with the visit logo packed the stadium stands and snapped pictures on their smartphones.
Thousands of people cheering and waving Vatican flags lined the entrance to the stadium, with the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and Abu Dhabi's skyscrapers glinting in the distance.
""For me as a Christian, this is one of the most important days of my life,"" said Thomas Tijo, a 44-year-old from India's southern state of Kerala, who lives in the UAE and traveled by bus in the early hours to get to the stadium.
""We are a long way from home and this is like a comforting blanket,"" he said, holding his three-year-old son, Marcus.
Organizers said Catholics from about 100 nations were expected to attend the Mass, along with about 4,000 Muslims, including government officials.
The pope, who arrived on Sunday at the invitation of Abu Dhabi's crown prince, has used the visit to condemn regional wars, including that in Yemen, the poorest country in the Peninsula, where the UAE is involved as part of a Saudi-led military coalition. He also called for greater cooperation between Christians and Muslims.
""The pope has made pleas for ending the Yemen war, greater tolerance and more,"" said Lina Ghattas, a 48-year-old Egyptian who had traveled from Bahrain.
""I am not sure what will change: time will tell - hope, hope,"" she said. 
PRAYERS FOR MIGRANTS AND PEACE
During the service the pope spoke in Italian and English, which is widely spoken in the UAE where expatriates outnumber Emiratis nine to one. The congregation prayed for migrant workers and their families and for the ending of wars.
The ceremony ended with a prayer, a thunderous round of applause from the crowd and organ music. 
""It’s a dream come true. I feel blessed,"" said Rio Chavez, a 40-year-old security officer who has been in the UAE for five years. He had called his wife and mother back home in the Philippines before the Mass so the pope's message about being far from home and loved ones had resonated for him.
""I feel renewed, positive, he is an inspiration for me and my family. I will work very hard to bring my family here, I have the pope's blessings now,"" he said.
A central part of the Christian faith, the Mass commemorates Jesus' Last Supper with his apostles on the night before he died.
Catholics believe the communion host and wine become the body and blood of Christ when consecrated by a priest during the Mass. Catholics believe the pope is the vicar of Christ on earth, so participating in a papal Mass is particularly special.
Priests and diplomats describe the UAE as one of the least restrictive environments in the Gulf for Christian worship, which is allowed in church compounds with special licenses. There are more than 40 churches, nine of them for Catholics.
But, like other Gulf states, it outlaws unsanctioned religious gatherings and non-Muslims must not proselytize.
""This pope's voice is heard, so our hope and prayer is that this historic visit brings peace to this strife-torn region,"" said Clitus Almeida, an Indian engineer who works in Dubai.
""Given the number of Catholics there is a dire need for more churches in the UAE,"" he said, voicing hope that Saudi Arabia, where churches are banned, would also allow them.
Although there has been no official comment from Riyadh, the pope has featured on the front pages of some of the main newspapers, which ran pictures of Francis' meetings with the grand imam of Al-Azhar in Abu Dhabi on Monday and UAE officials.
An opinion piece in Saudi-owned, pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat praised the visit and its message of tolerance and coexistence, which it said confronted a discourse of extremism in the region.

""The Arab region...for a very long time allowed rigid voices to hijack religious discourse, and it is time to correct the error.""

The financial reporting office would be part of the state's General Auditing Bureau, which watches out for financial discrepancies, public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb was quoted as saying on Monday by state news agency SPA.
""Corruption is not restricted to a specific company or government sector. The concerned authorities will be monitoring,"" he said. Public prosecutors would handle any investigations, he added.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last week that the crackdown launched in November 2017 - which netted scores of the kingdom's economic and political elite - had achieved its objectives.
The royal court said the operation had recovered more than $106 billion through settlements with scores of senior princes, ministers and top businessmen.
King Salman said at the time that the government would continue efforts to combat corruption and protect public funds.
Fifty-six people who were summoned under the anti-corruption campaign still face criminal charges, and eight others had declined settlement offers, the royal court has said.
The crackdown, which critics called a shakedown and power play by Prince Mohammed, unsettled some foreign investors that he is courting to diversify the economy away from oil.

Prince Mohammed has defended the campaign as “shock therapy” as he tries to overhaul the economy.

Iran’s comments came a day after the bloc criticized the Islamic Republic's ballistic missile tests and expressed concern at Iran's role in growing Middle East tensions.
The European Union has promised to abide by a 2015 nuclear deal under which Iran agreed to limit its atomic work in exchange for sanctions relief, even after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the accord because it did not cover Iranian military activities.
The EU has stepped up criticism of Iran's ballistic missiles program and its regional policies in a dual-track approach analysts say is designed to show Washington it is possible to contain Tehran while remaining inside the nuclear pact. 
The Iranian foreign ministry said on Tuesday Iran would never negotiate over its missile program, which it said was defensive and designed as a deterrent.
""Clear threats against the Islamic Republic are not constructive, efficient or helpful, and they are not in line with regional security and the real interests of Europe,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement published on its website.
Iran has expanded its missile program in the last two decades, particularly its ballistic missiles, in defiance of the United States and concern by European countries, especially France.
As part of EU efforts to sustain the nuclear pact, Britain, France and Germany last week launched the Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a system to facilitate non-dollar trade with Iran and avoid U.S. sanctions.
Iran's foreign ministry welcomed the new channel, but said it was ""late and inadequate"". Iran would revise relations with Europe if it did not benefit economically from INSTEX, it said.
The EU also urged Tehran to stop activities that deepened mistrust, including what it called Iranian assassination plots. France, Denmark and Netherlands have accused Iran of attacks against Iranian opposition figures and arrested suspects with links to Iranian embassies and intelligence ministry.
Iran's foreign ministry rejected the EU warning:

""Raising such baseless and hollow accusations while known terrorist and criminal groups are free in Europe, is not constructive at this stage and is in line with the goals of enemies who seek to undermine Iran’s relations with Europe.""

KABUL (Reuters) - The United States risks providing Afghanistan with state-of-the-art Black Hawk helicopters that the country's embattled air force does not have the pilots to fly nor the engineers to maintain, a U.S. watchdog said on Tuesday.
The warning, by the U.S. Special Inspector for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), comes amid widespread fears that the Afghan military will struggle to cope with a looming pullout of allied foreign troops after more than 17 years of conflict.
Talks between U.S. envoys and Taliban negotiators due to resume in Qatar on Feb. 25 are likely to center on the withdrawal of thousands of US-led NATO forces and a ceasefire to end America's longest war.
The U.S. military has provided the first 16 of a scheduled 159 UH-60 Black Hawks to the Afghan air force and its special forces, a move the watchdog says raises concerns about the country's ability to absorb the rest by 2023.
It calls for efforts to improve pilot training timetables and English-language skills, as well as build a teaching program for Afghan maintenance crews to replace foreign contractors.
""Given concerns that the Afghan air force and special mission wing may not be able to fully use all 159 aircraft when delivered, the Department of Defence runs the risk of wasting U.S. taxpayer dollars to purchase aircraft the AAF and SMW cannot fly or maintain,"" SIGAR said.
It urged that the training and maintenance be linked to the pace of deliveries so that Black Hawks ""will not sit idle in Afghanistan without enough pilots to fly them"".
Even reduced targets of U.S.-led training for 320 pilots may not be met, the watchdog added, with a class attrition rate of 26 per cent.
The Black Hawks are intended to replace a fleet of aging Soviet-era helicopters that now serve as workhorses for the Afghan air force, which is battling Taliban militants who have stepped up attacks over the last two years.
The hardline Islamist movement now controls or contests districts across nearly half of Afghanistan.
In December last year, Reuters reported that Afghanistan's fleet of 47 M-17s was under pressure from a deadly mix of hard use and poor maintenance.
As the pace of operations against Taliban and Islamic State insurgents has risen, crews said they faced pressure to take short cuts with maintenance, an issue U.S. military advisers saw as a major concern for the fledgling Afghan air force they were trying to build up, the Reuters report said.
SIGAR said the U.S. military ""acknowledged that the UH-60 has performance limitations when compared with the MI-17, which can fly higher and carry more passengers"".

Most missions flown by the Afghan air force did not need the additional capability provided by the Mi-17, the watchdog, quoting the U.S. military.

UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea is working to ensure its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities cannot be destroyed by military strikes, U.N. monitors said ahead of a meeting between U.S. and North Korean officials to prepare a second denuclearization summit.
The U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, will meet his North Korean counterpart on Wednesday in Pyongyang to prepare for a summit later this month between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.Biegun has said he hoped the meeting with new North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol would map out ""a set of concrete deliverables"" for the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un.
Biegun, who held talks with South Korean officials in Seoul on Sunday and Monday, said he would be aiming for ""a roadmap of negotiations and declarations going forward, and a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of our joint efforts"".
South Korean officials said they and the United States could be looking at a compromise that could expedite North Korea's denuclearization - the dismantling of the North's main Yongbyon nuclear complex, which could be reciprocated by U.S. measures including formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and setting up a liaison office.
But U.N. sanctions monitors said in a confidential report, submitted to a 15-member U.N. Security Council sanctions committee and seen by Reuters on Monday, that they had ""found evidence of a consistent trend on the part of the DPRK to disperse its assembly, storage and testing locations"", using the abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, which was submitted to Security Council members on Friday.
The first summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un last June in Singapore yielded a vague commitment by Kim to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, where U.S. troops have been stationed since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The Vietnamese resort town of Danang is seen as the most likely location for the next summit.
Trump last Thursday hailed ""tremendous progress"" in his dealings with North Korea, but the view in the United States is that it has yet to take concrete steps to give up its nuclear weapons program.
'SANCTIONS INEFFECTIVE'
North Korea has complained the United States has done little to reciprocate its freezing of nuclear and missile testing and dismantling of some nuclear facilities. 
It has also repeatedly urged a lifting of punishing U.S.-led sanctions, a formal end to the war, and security guarantees. 
The U.N. report said sanctions were proving ineffective.
""The country continues to defy Security Council resolutions through a massive increase in illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products and coal,"" the sanctions monitors found.
""These violations render the latest U.N. sanctions ineffective.""
The monitors said they had evidence of one unprecedented prohibited petroleum product transfer of more than 57,600 barrels, worth more than $5.7 million. 
North Korea has said it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States first removes any threat to it. North Korea has long demanded U.S. troops be withdrawn as a condition for peace.
The Korean War ended with an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war.
The United States has stressed that U.S. troops are not a bargaining chip and South Korea has said U.S. troops in the South were unrelated to any future peace treaty and that American forces should stay even if such an agreement is signed.
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that Washington and Seoul had reached an agreement ""in principle"" on sharing the cost of stationing U.S. troops in the Asian country.
CNN quoted a State Department official as saying that under the revised agreement, South Korea would boost its contribution to nearly $1 billion.
A 2014 deal that expired last year required South Korea to pay about 960 billion won ($848 million) a year for keeping some 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea. The allies had appeared unable to strike an accord to renew the deal despite 10 rounds of talks since March.

The painting was originally auctioned as ""Girl with Balloon"", the image of a young girl holding a heart-shaped red balloon that has become the artist's most popular since it was first sprayed on to London's Waterloo Bridge in 2002.
But the moment the auctioneer's gavel fell, a hidden mechanism inside the frame shredded half the painting, which had just been sold for over a million pounds.
Museum director Henning Schaper said they had been anxious to avoid being the victim of another of the ""subversive, clever"" artist's practical jokes and seeing the rest of the painting shred itself while it was in their charge.
""We opened up the frame and found the shredder machinery, the battery holders, the wires and satisfied ourselves that the batteries had been removed and the wires cut,"" he said after curators wearing white gloves had carefully hung the work in its new place.
The owner, an anonymous European art collector, agreed to go through with the purchase of the painting, which the artist officially renamed after its shredding, and has now loaned it to the Frieder Burda Museum in Baden-Baden for a month.
The museum will not charge the public to see the painting. Schaper said that since Banksy was an advocate of the democratization of art and a street artist, it would be wrong to make the public pay to see it.
""We wanted to engage with his philosophy by hanging the art work where people don't have to pay to get in and can experience Banksy's art and join us in a critical debate on developments on the art market,"" Schaper said.

The painting will be on display in the south-western city until March 3 before it is moved to the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, which will also not charge to view it.

""The United States and the Republic of Korea have reached an agreement in principle on a new Special Measures Agreement,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Both sides are committed to working out remaining technical issues as quickly as possible.""
CNN quoted an State Department official as saying that under the revised agreement, South Korea would boost its financial contribution to nearly $1 billion.
The 2014 deal that expired last year required Seoul to pay about 960 billion won ($848 million) a year for keeping some 28,500 U.S. troops in the South Korea. The allies had appeared unable to strike an accord to renew the deal despite 10 rounds of talks since March.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that South Korea, where the United States has stationed soldiers since the 1950-53 Korean War, should bear more of the cost.
South Korean news agency Yonhap earlier quoted a diplomatic source in Seoul as saying that Washington appeared set to accept South Korea's request to contribute under $1 billion in 2019, and that the agreement would run for a year as opposed to a previous five-year deal.
Yonhap said the two sides were expected to seal the deal as early this week. Its source attributed the compromise to the allies' efforts to focus on diplomacy with North Korea ahead of a second U.S.-North Korea summit planned for later this month.
South Korean officials have said Seoul had sought to limit its share to $1 trillion won ($891 million) and make the agreement valid for at least three years. 
A senior legislator in South Korea's ruling party said last month that negotiations were deadlocked after the United States made a ""sudden, unacceptable"" demand that South Korea pay more than 1.4 trillion won ($1.25 billion) per year.
About 70 percent of Seoul's contribution covers the salaries of some 8,700 South Korean employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military.
The U.S. military warned Korean workers on its bases they might be put on leave from mid-April if no deal was reached.
Trump announced a halt to joint exercises with South Korea in June after his first meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying they were expensive and paid for mostly by the United States.

Major joint exercises have been suspended, which Washington said would expedite talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program, but some small-scale drills have continued.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Expelled from the ruling leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and thwarted in trying to create his own party, Nayib Bukele forged his own path to victory as an outsider in El Salvador's presidential election.
Bukele, 37, a businessman and former mayor, had to search for a new political home after being ejected in 2017 from the FMLN for a allegedly breaking party rules.
In his last days as mayor of the capital, San Salvador, last year, Bukele tried and failed to create his own party. He then joined a center-left party, only to see it shut down by El Salvador's electoral tribune. 
Finally, he aligned himself with the Great National Alliance (GANA), a conservative party. 
The third try proved to be the charm. Bukele won 53 percent of votes in Sunday's presidential election, sweeping to victory in the first round on the strength of his vigorous use of social media and promises to modernize government and tackle problems like corruption plaguing the Central American country.
His victory ended the reign of the two parties that had dominated El Salvador since the end of its vicious civil war in 1992 - the FMLN, a former rebel movement that entered politics after the civil war, and the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA).
Bukele's unconventional path to the presidency reflects the new approach the country's youngest-ever president-elect aims to bring to governing after he assumes office in June.
""He is able to think about solutions to problems in creative ways,"" Bertha de Leon, Bukele's friend and lawyer, said in an interview. ""He may not necessarily be right, but that's something valuable in a leader - offering proposals that nobody has raised.""
WHIRLWIND POLITICAL CAREER
Bukele, an entrepreneur of Palestinian descent, is a self-professed fan of U.S. television series such as the political thriller ""House of Cards"" and legal drama ""Billions."" 
He and his wife, ballerina Gabriela Rodriguez, just finished watching ""The Good Wife,"" a U.S. series that aired from 2009 to 2016 about the wife of a disgraced politician, Bukele told local media.
Bukele, who did not respond to requests for comment, made his political debut in 2012 as mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán, a small coffee-growing town outside the capital. With limited resources and little media attention, he used social media to draw attention to his work. 
He then served as mayor of San Salvador from 2015 to 2018, where he rose to prominence by championing social causes and donating his salary for scholarships.
With slicked-back hair and a thick beard, Bukele refused to give interviews or participate in debates, saying the events would be stacked against him. 
Instead, he engaged with his supporters on social media, urging them to share their thoughts on how to tackle corruption.
Bukele ran on an anti-corruption platform, but he has not been free of scandal allegations himself. 
He has been accused of plagiarizing parts of his government platform. He is also under investigation for alleged money laundering and fraud during his time as mayor of San Salvador and Nuevo Cuscatlán.
Bukele has not commented on the money-laundering allegation but denies the other accusations.

U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun said last week he aimed in working-level negotiations with his new North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol to map out ""a set of concrete deliverables"" for the second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un.
Biegun said he would be aiming for ""a roadmap of negotiations and declarations going forward, and a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of our joint efforts.""
An unprecedented first summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un last June in Singapore yielded a vague commitment by Kim to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, where U.S. troops have been stationed since the 1950-53 Korean War.
In the U.S. view, Pyongyang has yet to take concrete steps to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States, while North Korea has complained that Washington has done little to reciprocate its freezing of nuclear and missile testing and dismantling of some nuclear facilities. 
Pyongyang has repeatedly urged a lifting of punishing U.S.-led sanctions, a formal end to the war, and security guarantees.
On Thursday, Biegun said Kim Jong Un had committed during an October visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the dismantling and destruction his country's plutonium and uranium enrichment facilities in return for ""corresponding measures"" from the United States. 
Biegun said such corresponding steps would be the subject of this week's talks and Washington was willing to discuss ""many actions"" to improve ties and entice Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. At the same time, he set out an extensive list of demands, including a full disclosure of North Korea's arms program.
Biegun held talks with South Korean officials in Seoul on Sunday and Monday. 
Trump on Thursday hailed ""tremendous progress"" in his dealings with North Korea and said the date and location of a second summit would be announced ""early next week"" - probably during his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.
Vietnam's central resort town of Danang has been seen as the most likely location.

The director of U.S. national intelligence, Dan Coats, told Congress on Tuesday that North Korea was unlikely to give up all its nuclear weapons and has continued activity inconsistent with pledges to denuclearize.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>",Mexico to try new tactics in search for those missing in drug war,"By Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican officials on Monday presented a new plan to search for the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared during the country's drug war, creating a new forensic institute and working more closely with international groups and families.
The government estimates more than 40,000 people have gone missing in Mexico, and there are about 26,000 unidentified bodies in the forensic system, Alejandro Encinas, the undersecretary for human rights in the interior ministry, said during a news conference on Monday. Officials believe there are more than 1,100 hidden burial sites in the country, he added.
""Unfortunately, our territory has become a huge clandestine grave,"" he said.
The plan to locate the missing was outlined by the government of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. During the campaign, Lopez Obrador presented a strategy that leaned heavily on ""transitional justice"" - which often involves leniency for those who admit guilt, as well as truth commissions to investigate atrocities and the granting of reparations for victims.
The new forensic institute, known as the National Search System (SNB), will begin operating in March, Encinas said.
The government will pay special attention to migrants, who account for about 8 to 10 percent of the missing, Encinas said.
Thousands of Central American migrants have entered Mexico in large caravans over the past year, seeking to settle in the United States to escape poverty and violence. The government will devote extra resources to heavily trafficked corridors, such as the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, Encinas said.
The government will also launch a database that can be accessed by officials throughout the country, with technical support from international groups such as the United Nations and the Red Cross.
International groups have helped investigate high-profile disappearances, including the case of 43 students who went missing in 2014.

The case became emblematic of a surge in violence and corruption during Enrique Pena Nieto's presidency that fueled the landslide victory of leftist Lopez Obrador.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Salvadorans voiced hope for a changed country on Monday after political outsider Nayib Bukele won a sweeping victory in the presidential election with a pledge to tackle the corruption and violence plaguing the Central American nation. 
Bukele, 37, a former mayor of the capital, San Salvador, won 53 percent of the vote with returns counted from 99.9 percent of polling stations, the national electoral tribunal said on Monday, allowing him to clinch the presidency in the first round of voting.
His emphatic victory in Sunday's election was a stunning rebuke to the two political parties that had dominated El Salvador since its civil war, the ruling leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and its long-standing rival, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA).
Bukele's promises to modernize government and his dynamic use of social media have energized young Salvadorans, eager for an end to the economic stagnation, poverty and violence that have beset the nation of 6.5 million people following its vicious 1980-1992 civil war. 
On the bustling streets of San Salvador, Juana de Calderon, a 38-year-old cook in a small restaurant, said she cast a vote for Bukele hoping to put a stop to corruption.
""We hope that he fulfills what he promised in the campaign,"" she said while preparing empanadas, a savory pastry popular in Latin America. ""If we voted for him, it's because we want something new - to have a different country.""
Bukele's two rivals from the FMLN and ARENA quickly accepted defeat on Sunday evening. 
Bukele must now contend with U.S. President Donald Trump's frequent threats to cut aid to El Salvador - as well as to neighboring Guatemala and Honduras - if they do not do more to curb migration to the United States. 
Gang violence has made El Salvador one of the world's most murderous countries in the past few years, driving Salvadorans to flee to the north. 
Among his campaign promises, Bukele, an avid social media user who snapped a selfie with supporters before declaring his win, said he would push infrastructure projects to limit migration.
He will face challenges, however, pursuing his reform agenda from a divided Congress and an onerous government deficit. Bukele's allies have only 11 legislators in the 84-seat Congress.
Credit rating agency Fitch said on Monday that governability would be a challenge for Bukele and highlighted an increased risk of polarization between the president and Congress. It forecast only modest economic improvement this year.
TURNING AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL LEFT
Growing up, Bukele's relatively wealthy family was sympathetic to the FMLN, the former leftist guerrilla army that became a political party at the end of the civil war.
But Bukele has turned away from Latin America's traditional left, branding Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega as well as conservative Honduran Juan Orlando Hernandez as dictators.
""A dictator is a dictator, on the 'right' or the 'left,'"" Bukele wrote last week on Twitter.
Although he was expelled from the FMLN in 2017, Bukele describes himself as from the left. As he sought the presidency, however, he joined a conservative party known as GANA, or ""win"" in Spanish.
Along with the goal of modernizing government, Bukele, who is set to take office in June, has proposed creating an international anti-corruption commission with the support of the United Nations, following similar committees in Guatemala and Honduras.

""We'll create a (commission) ... so that the corrupt can't hide where they always hide. Instead, they'll have to give back what they stole,"" Bukele said in January.

While Russian security services posed the biggest threat, China also conducts intelligence operations against Norwegian interests and businesses, including trying to penetrate computer networks, Norwegian intelligence service PST said in its annual threat assessment report.
""China poses no threat to Norway's security. It's very ridiculous for the intelligence service of a country to make security assessment and attack China with pure hypothetical language,"" the Chinese Embassy in Oslo said in a statement on its website.
Huawei faces international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and allegations that Beijing could use Huawei's technology for spying, which the company denies.
The Embassy also rejected comments by PST's chief Benedicte Bjoernland that people should be aware of Huawei because of its links with China's government, saying that China was not forcing any companies to build ""mandatory back doors"" in their software.
Norway has been considering whether to join other western nations in excluding Huawei Technologies from building part of the Nordic country's new 5G telecommunications infrastructure.

Norway's state-controlled operator Telenor, which has 173 million subscribers across eight countries in Europe and Asia, signed its first major contract with Huawei in 2009, a deal that helped clear the way for the Chinese firm's global expansion.

MADRID/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Major European nations joined the United States on Monday in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, while members of a separate regional bloc kept up the pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
The coordinated recognition by a flood of European Union nations including Britain, Germany, France and Spain followed the expiration of an ultimatum for Maduro to call a new presidential election, aligning them with Washington and against Russia and China.
""From today, we will spare no effort in helping all Venezuelans achieve freedom, prosperity and harmony,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said as he announced Madrid had recognized Guaido, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly who declared himself last month to be the oil-rich South American country's interim ruler.
Eleven of the 14 members of the so-called Lima Group, including Argentina, Brazil and Canada, reiterated their support for Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate interim leader and called for free elections. 
In a statement following a meeting in Ottawa, they urged the international community to prevent Maduro's government from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, having access to Venezuela's international assets and doing business in oil, gold and other assets. Mexico, a Lima Group member opposed to steps aimed at ousting Maduro, did not attend. 
Maduro's government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations, saying their move would affect relations with Caracas. In a statement, it accused them of submitting to a U.S. ""strategy to overthrow the legitimate government"" and singled out Spain for acting ""cowardly.""
Among other EU nations recognizing Guaido were: Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Sweden. The United States welcomed the EU nations' recognition of Guaido and encouraged other countries to follow suit, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. 
Italy, however, blocked a joint EU position to recognize Guaido, diplomatic sources said, with the government in Rome deeply divided over the issue. Norway, not an EU member, said it also was not recognizing him.
In power since former President Hugo Chavez's death in 2013, Maduro has been accused by critics of running the OPEC nation of 30 million people like a dictatorship.
The 35-year-old Guaido, accused by Maduro's government of staging a U.S.-directed coup, has galvanized Venezuela's opposition with a hopeful message. Guaido repeatedly has called on Venezuela's military, which has remained loyal to Maduro, to support a transition to democracy. 
""Soldiers, we continue to wait for you. The moment is now,"" Guaido said in a speech on Monday in Caracas, urging the military to allow humanitarian aid to reach people. 
Maduro is facing calls from a growing chorus of nations, including some of Venezuela's neighbors, to resign in the wake of last year's disputed presidential vote in which he won re-election. Critics have called that election a sham and the mainstream opposition boycotted it.
He has defied European heads of state, calling them sycophants for following U.S. President Donald Trump.
Maduro sent a letter to Pope Francis requesting a renewal of dialogue in the crisis, the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said in Abu Dhabi.
'VERY CRITICAL'
Most members of the Lima Group, which aims to peacefully resolve the Venezuela crisis, have said Maduro should quit in favor of Guaido and have called for new elections. The United States also wants Maduro gone, as do other key Western nations.
Last month, the Lima Group announced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials and a freeze on their foreign assets.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would formally recognize Guaido's chosen envoy as Venezuela's legitimate representative in Canada in a move his government called symbolic.
In New York, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said U.N. officials will not participate in international initiatives on Venezuela in order to remain neutral.
Maduro's critics have said incompetent policies and corruption have impoverished the once-wealthy nation, leaving it with widespread shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent in 2019.
Guaido accused Maduro's government of trying to move up to $1.2 billion from the state development bank Bandes to a financial entity in Uruguay, but did not present evidence. Guaido urged Uruguay to prevent the move. Uruguay's central bank and the office of the country's president did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Maduro blames Washington and other Western nations for sabotaging Venezuela's economy, including through sanctions. The United States last week imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, said military intervention in Venezuela was ""an option.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Monday ordered authorities to take a jailed asthma sufferer to a hospital but denied his request for emergency bail from a Brooklyn federal detention center where heat and power failed during last week's frigid weather. 
The order came as the law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP filed suit on Monday at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, saying the Federal Bureau of Prisons has exposed prisoners to inhumane conditions at Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC).
The conditions at MDC sparked protests outside the jail this weekend by friends and relatives of the prisoners and outcries from government officials.
""The lawsuit seeks immediate relief for the deplorable and rapidly deteriorating conditions at the facility, including sustained periods of time with little heat, light and medical care for inmates,"" the law firm said in a statement. 
Authorities said power and heat had been restored at the prison on Sunday after an outage caused by a Jan. 27 electrical fire, leaving some of the more than 1,600 men and women in cold, dark cells for days. Lawyers for the inmates have disputed that and said some areas of the prison were still without power. 
In a separate hearing on Monday, a judge temporarily restored the right of attorneys to meet with prisoners at the center after federal authorities had suspended such visits. A hearing on the issue was scheduled for Feb. 13.
Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said in a statement on Monday that the facility has returned to normal.
The department ""will work with the Bureau of Prisons to examine what happened and ensure the facility has the power, heat and backup systems in place to prevent the problem from reoccurring,"" Hornbuckle said.
Lawyers for Dino Sanchez, who has been housed at the detention center since Jan. 16, requested emergency bail for their client, claiming that he was receiving improper care for his chronic asthma. 
Benjamin Yaster, a lawyer with the Federal Defenders of New York, said the power outage kept Sanchez from requesting medical care through the jail's computer system. 
The conditions made it difficult for Sanchez to breathe and left him ""spitting up blood"" in his cell over the weekend, Yaster said during the hearing at the United States District Court in Brooklyn. 
Judge Ann Donnelly denied the bail request, saying Sanchez still posed a threat to society, but said that he was entitled to proper medical care. A second hearing on the matter was scheduled for Tuesday.

Sanchez, who wore tan jumpsuit during the court appearance, was arrested as a suspect in a heroin distribution ring operating in Brooklyn, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice. He appeared to be shivering while clutching his chest during the hearing.

The proposal is one of several under consideration, as President Jair Bolsonaro looks to get the legislative ball rolling on his ambitious plans to overhaul Brazil's creaking social security system.
Currently, if workers have contributed into the system for at least 15 years, the earliest men can retire is 65 and for women it is 60. But men can retire at any age if they have paid into the system for at least 35 years, and women if they have contributed for 30 years.
Speaking to reporters outside the Economy Ministry in Brasilia, Rogerio Marinho, secretary of social security and labor at the ministry, confirmed talks were underway on the proposal to change that.

Investors have pinned much of their optimistic outlook for Brazil this year on Bolsonaro delivering on pension reform. The elections of Bolsonaro allies as house and senate presidents last week were seen as a step in that direction. [nL1N1ZX0AE]

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan pro-independence parties said on Monday they would file parliamentary amendments opposing the Spanish government's 2019 budget proposal, potentially putting at risk the budget and the administration of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez' Socialists.
Sanchez' minority Socialist government came to power last June and holds just a quarter of the seats in parliament, meaning it relies on the backing of anti-austerity Podemos, Catalan nationalists and other small parties to pass laws.
The two Catalan parties, ERC and PDeCAT, said they would file full parliamentary amendments against the budget proposal, which faces its first vote next week, unless Sanchez is open to some of their political demands. 
Under Spanish parliamentary procedure, such amendments can block the entire budget bill.
Failure by parliament to approve the government's 2019 budget bill could prompt a snap election before the next scheduled vote in 2020.
PDeCAT, the party that holds the Catalan presidency, wants the government to launch a nationwide dialogue forum between political parties ""to address politically the Catalan issue,"" their parliamentary spokesperson Carles Campuzano told Reuters.
ERC, the party that has led recent polls in Catalonia, went further and requested an authorized referendum on the region's independence.
The trial of 12 Catalan independence leaders starts on Feb. 12. Spain's public prosecutor is seeking prison terms of up to 25 years for the leaders on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds for their role in Catalonia's failed 2017 break away from Spain. 
Feb. 12 is also the last day the two parties could withdraw their amendments over the budget proposal.
""Until Feb. 12 they (the parties) have time to reflect, to carefully study the figures and to consider the opportunity cost for all citizens of Catalonia,"" Batet added.

On Feb. 14 all proposed amendments to the budget bill will be voted on in a simple majority vote. If they pass, the budget proposal would be effectively rejected, raising pressure on Sanchez to call an election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Monday called on countries to take in foreign fighters captured by America's Kurdish allies in Syria, two days ahead of a meeting in Washington of dozens of coalition partners fighting Islamic State to discuss the way forward in Syria.
The department's spokesman, Robert Palladino, did not say how many prisoners had been detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces - an alliance of militias dominated by the Kurdish YPG - but U.S. officials believe they number about 850.
The United States has long said it wants to see the fighters returned to their countries of origin in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa to face prosecution.
""The SDF has demonstrated a clear commitment to detain these individuals securely and humanely,"" Palladino said in a statement, which gave no details of where the prisoners were being held. 
""The United States calls upon other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens detained by the SDF,"" he added.
U.S. officials say there has been a slight uptick in the number of foreign fighters in SDF custody as U.S.-backed forces retake the last remaining Islamic State-held areas.
The issue is likely to be raised on Wednesday at the first high-level meeting of allies since President Donald Trump's announcement in December that he was pulling U.S. forces from Syria.
Trump's announcement stunned allies, especially the SDF, which has been among the most effective against Islamic State, and led to the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
A Pentagon adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the State Department statement reflected the dilemma about what to do with the prisoners created by the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
""This was a problem created by surprise with an ill-coordinated and ill-considered announcement of complete U.S. withdrawal from Syria,"" said the Pentagon adviser. ""We now have precipitated a crisis because our allied counties were not expecting to have to bring back home their foreign fighters.""
A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters before Wednesday's meeting, said the administration's goals in Syria remained the enduring defeat of Islamic State, the exit of all Iranian forces from Syria and reaching a political settlement to end the conflict.
The official said the meeting was not a pledging conference, although he emphasized there were funding shortfalls for humanitarian assistance in northeast Syria and Iraq, as well as efforts at mine removal and stabilization.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>",Germany could miss even reduced NATO defense spending goal: document,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has cast doubt over the government's already watered-down pledge to NATO allies of spending 1.5 percent of economic output on defense by 2024, a Finance Ministry document obtained by Reuters showed on Monday.
Germany is under pressure from the United States and other NATO members to increase its military spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product, in line with a target agreed by NATO members in 2014 and reaffirmed in subsequent years.
Military spending remains a source of great tension within Germany's ruling coalition, with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives pushing for quicker increases in defense budgets but Scholz's Social Democrats riding the brakes.
The government's tax revenues are likely to rise less than expected in coming years due to a slowing economy which means that options for additional spending are exhausted, the 22-page ministry document said.
The document, prepared for Scholz to present to cabinet members, said the finance ministry had earmarked 7.3 billion euros ($8.34 billion) for additional defense and development aid spending until 2022. 
However, it would require much higher spending to get close to the already reduced defense goal of 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024 as Chancellor Angela Merkel promised NATO allies last year, according to a separate graphic in the document.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a conservative, said during a visit to Latvia that negotiations about the 2020 budget had just begun, but stressed that the coalition partners had agreed to boost military spending to 1.5 percent of GDP.
She said the issue would be discussed during talks on the budget, which is due to be finalised in late March. ""We have time until the end of March. Let us negotiate,"" von der Leyen told reporters in Riga.
Military spending is expected to rise to 1.3 percent of GDP this year from just over 1.2 percent in 2018. Even stabilizing spending at the current level would require the government to shift money out of other programs which could prove politically tricky.

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Tougher sentencing and a clampdown on political corruption and organized crime groups are part of the new Brazilian right-wing government's proposal unveiled on Monday to tackle rampant crime in a country with the world's highest number of murders.
Justice Minister Sergio Moro, a former judge who made his name jailing scores of Brazil's business and political elite in the so-called ""Operation Car Wash"" investigation during the past five years, told reporters that he would send proposed changes to 14 laws to Congress soon.
The measures are part of the first major anti-crime plan of the administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who surged to power last year on a vow to end years of corruption and spiraling violent crime. 
""Why did I set out to tackle corruption, organized crime and violent crime in this package? Because these three problems are related,"" Moro said at a news conference following a meeting with meeting with state governors and their public security secretaries. ""Bolsonaro agrees wholeheartedly with these proposals and he also wants to lower impunity of violent crimes, practiced by criminal gangs, and of crimes of corruption.""
One of Moro's most important proposals is a move to force convicts to be jailed after their conviction is upheld on first appeal, seeking to end de facto impunity for the wealthy and well-connected, who have previously been free while their appeals crawl through court. 
Brazil's Supreme Court in 2016 ruled that convicts could be jailed after a first appeal, but is due to revisit that decision in April and may reverse it. Some justices argue that what was meant as a possibility has in practice become mandatory. 
Congress passing a law would likely take the matter out of the top court's hands.
It remains to be seen how Moro's plans will fare in Congress, where about one-third of lawmakers face some type of criminal investigation and several have been ensnared in corruption probes. 
Bolsonaro has no formal coalition, relying instead on caucuses from the agricultural, evangelical and public security sectors. Moro said he was willing to meet with lawmakers, hear their concerns and seek consensus for passing the bill.
His proposals include measures to toughen prison sentences for habitual criminals and mandating that leaders of violent gangs should serve their sentences in high security prisons.

Moro also sought to enshrine plea bargains, outlined new guidance for what defines a criminal gang and proposed whistleblower legislation.

(Reuters) - Jurors began deliberations in the trial of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, accused of running one of the world's most infamous drug cartels, in Brooklyn federal court on Monday morning.
Guzman, 61, is accused of leading Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, which became one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. He twice escaped from prison in Mexico, and will face the possibility of life in a U.S. prison if convicted.
The 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named for the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village. 
Prosecutors said he trafficked tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.
The defense argued that Chapo was set up as a ""fall guy"" by Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large.
The most detailed evidence against Guzman came from more than a dozen former associates who struck deals to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors. 
Through them, jurors heard how the Sinaloa Cartel gained power amid the shifting allegiances of the Mexican drug trade in the 1990s, eventually coming to control almost the entire Pacific coast of Mexico.
They heard how Guzman made a name for himself in the 1980s as ""El Rapido,"" the speedy one, by building cross-border tunnels that allowed him to move cocaine from Mexico into the United States faster than anyone else.
Despite his ties to government officials, Guzman often lived on the run. Imprisoned in Mexico for drug trafficking in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years hiding in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army.
He was seized and imprisoned again in 2014, but pulled off his best known escape the following year when he disappeared into a tunnel dug into his cell at a maximum security prison. 
He was finally captured again in 2016 after a shootout in Sinaloa and extradited to the United States from Mexico in January, 2017. 
The jury to decide his fate is comprised of seven women and five men. Their names have not been disclosed for security reasons. 
At least three jurors are immigrants, three are Spanish speakers and several have ties to law enforcement. 

Almost all of them had heard of Guzman before the trial began, but said they could be impartial. The only exception was a woman from Ethiopia who said she had ""no clue"" who he was.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is Mexico's most notorious kingpin who shipped tonnes of drugs around the world, escaped two maximum-security jails and became one of the world's most-wanted fugitives.
He now faces the prospect of life in prison.
Jurors on Monday will begin deliberations on 10 criminal counts facing Guzman, 61, in the trial that began in November in New York.
The audacious exploits of El Chapo, or Shorty, captured the world's imagination and turned him into a folk hero for some in Mexico, despite the thousands of people killed by his brutal Sinaloa cartel.
Beyond putting Guzman's personal life and drug dealings on public display, the case has also highlighted Mexico's long-time fight to bring down its chief adversary in the bloody war on drug trafficking. 
In January 2016, after some three decades running drugs, Guzman was caught in his native northwestern state of Sinaloa. 
Six months earlier, he had humiliated Mexico's then-president, Enrique Pena Nieto, by escaping from prison through a mile-long tunnel dug straight into his cell - his second time escaping a Mexican jail. 
Just days after his 2016 capture, Guzman's larger-than-life reputation was sealed when U.S. movie star Sean Penn published a lengthy account of an interview he conducted with the drug lord, which the Mexican government said was ""essential"" to his capture a few months later.
""I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,"" Penn said Guzman told him at the drug lord's mountain hideout.
Mexico's government extradited Guzman in January 2017, a day before Donald Trump took office as U.S. president on vows to tighten border security to halt immigration and drug smuggling.
Guzman's legendary reputation in the Mexican underworld began to take shape when he staged his first jailbreak in 2001 by bribing prison guards, before going on to dominate drug trafficking along much of the Rio Grande.
However, many in towns across Mexico remember Guzman better for his squads of hitmen who committed thousands of murders, kidnappings and decapitations.
Violence began to surge in 2006 as the government launched a war on drug trafficking that caused criminal groups to splinter and killings to spiral.
Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel went on smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, marijuana, and crystal meth across Mexico's border with the United States. 
In February 2013, the Chicago Crime Commission dubbed him the city's first Public Enemy No.1 since Al Capone.
ELUSIVE KINGPIN
Security experts concede the 5 foot 6 inch gangster was exceptional at what he did, managing to outmaneuver, outfight or outbribe his rivals to stay at the top of the drug trade for over a decade.
Rising through the ranks of the drug world, Guzman carefully observed his mentors' tactics and mistakes, forging alliances that kept him one step ahead of the law for years.
Mexican soldiers and U.S. agents came close to Guzman on several occasions but his layers of body guards and spies always tipped him off before they stormed his safe houses. 
In preparing for a raid in 2014, U.S. officers restricted information to a small group for fear of corruption among Mexican law enforcement, DEA agent Victor Vasquez testified in Guzman's trial. 
SINALOA ROOTS
Guzman was born in La Tuna, a village in the Sierra Madre mountains in Sinaloa state where smugglers have been growing opium and marijuana since the early twentieth century.
He ascended in the 1980s working with Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, alias ""The Boss of Bosses,"" who pioneered cocaine smuggling routes into the United States.
The aspiring capo came to prominence in 1993 when assassins who shot dead Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas claimed they had actually been aiming at Guzman.
Two weeks later, police arrested him in Guatemala and extradited him to Mexico. During his eight-year prison stay, Guzman smuggled in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to accounts published in the Mexican media.
After escaping, Guzman expanded his turf by sending in assassin squads with names such as ""The Ghosts"" and ""The Zeta Killers,"" in reference to the rival Zetas gang.
Guzman hid near his childhood home, agents said, but rumors abounded of him visiting expensive restaurants and paying for all the diners.
In 2007, Guzman married an 18-year-old beauty queen in an ostentatious ceremony in a village in Durango state.
The state's archbishop subsequently caused a media storm when he said that ""everyone, except the authorities,"" knew Guzman was living there. Guzman's bride, Emma Coronel, gave birth to twins in Los Angeles in 2011. She attended nearly every day of her husband's trial, at one point donning a red blazer that matched his own.
WAGING WAR
Between 2004 and 2013, Guzman's gangs fought in all major Mexican cities on the U.S. border, turning Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo into some of the world's most dangerous places.
In one such attack, 14 bodies were left mutilated under a note that read, ""Don't forget that I am your real daddy,"" signed by ""El Chapo."" 
Guzman's Sinaloa cartel often clashed with the Zetas, a gang founded by former Mexican soldiers, arming its crew with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. 
In 2008, hitmen working for a rival murdered Guzman's son Edgar, a 22-year-old student. Guzman reportedly left 50,000 flowers at his son's grave.
In the 1990s, Guzman became infamous for hiding seven tons of cocaine in cans of chili peppers. In the following decade, his crew took drugs in tractor trailers to major U.S. cities including Phoenix, Los Angeles and Chicago, indictments say.

Forbes magazine put the kingpin's wealth at $1 billion, though investigators say it is impossible to know exactly how much he was worth.

Representatives from both parties met for a second day on a ship on the Red Sea on Monday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, in a U.N.-led push to implement the stalled troop withdrawal which was agreed at December talks in Sweden. 
""Both parties have reiterated their commitment to implementing the Hodeidah aspects of the Stockholm agreement,"" Dujarric said. 
The warring parties were meant to withdraw their forces by Jan. 7 as part of efforts to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, but have failed to do so as the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and the Saudi-backed government disagree on who should control the city and ports.
A Sunni Muslim Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.
The truce has largely held in Hodeidah, but clashes have increased in recent weeks. Violence has continued in other parts of the country not subject to the deal.
In a statement on Monday, the 15-member U.N. Security Council expressed concern at allegations of violations of the ceasefire. In a Jan. 31 letter to the council, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen accused the Houthis of 970 violations since Dec. 18. 
""The members of the Security Council called on the parties to seize this opportunity to move towards sustainable peace by exercising restraint, de-escalating tensions, honoring their commitment to the Stockholm Agreement and moving forward with swift implementation,"" the council said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Constitutional amendments proposed by Egyptian lawmakers would allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power for up to 12 years beyond his current term and boost his control of the judiciary, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
The proposed amendments were submitted to the speaker of parliament on Sunday. Any changes need approval by two-thirds of parliament members, followed by a referendum. 
Sisi, a former general, ousted President Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after mass protests against his rule and was elected president the following year.
In recent months, speculation has been building that his supporters would seek to amend a constitutional clause according to which he should step down at the end of his second four-year term in 2022.
The amendments submitted on Sunday include an extension of the presidential term to six years from four in article 140 of the constitution, and a ""transitional"" clause that would reset the clock, potentially allowing Sisi to stay in power until 2034.
""After the expiry of his current term, the President of the Republic may run again in accordance to the amended article 140,"" the draft clause says.
The proposed changes also give Sisi new powers over appointing judges and the public prosecutor. They add a second parliamentary chamber known as the Council of Senators, in which the president would appoint one-third of the 250 members.
Sisi's supporters say extending his term is necessary to allow him more time to implement economic development plans and ensure Egypt's stability.
""He is doing a lot of projects and people are fighting him from all sides,"" said Ayman Abdel Hakim, a lawyer and former civil servant who filed a court case along with 300 Sisi supporters in December demanding that Egypt's parliament debate the two-term limit and consider changing it.
Parliament is overwhelmingly supportive of Sisi, though a 16-member leftist bloc held a news conference on Monday to denounce the proposed amendments, saying they canceled out the principal gain of Egypt's Jan. 25, 2011 uprising, the changeover of civilian power. 
One leftist lawmaker, Haitham al-Hariri, told Reuters the proposals were a ""coup against the Egyptian constitution"".
""We were naive to think that they would only extend the presidential term limits,"" he said, referring to the plan to widen the president's powers. 
Critics say 63-year-old Sisi has led Egypt deeper into authoritarianism than former president Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in 2011 after ruling for three decades under a state of emergency.
Rights groups say he has muzzled political opponents, activists and critical media, while courts have passed sentences against hundreds of his opponents.
Some Egyptians took to social media to criticize the draft amendments. ""No to changing the constitution"" was the top trending hashtag late on Sunday, with more than 26,000 tweets.
""The proposed amendments don't come as a surprise, they are a continuation of what we have seen ever since Sisi came to power, or a continued expansion of his powers as well as consolidation of that power,"" said Timothy Kaldas of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.

ROTTERDAM (Reuters) - A rare D-Day flag that flew on a U.S. Navy ship leading the allied advance at the beaches of Normandy nearly 75 years ago will be returned to America after going on display in the Netherlands on Monday.
The 48-star ""Normandy"" flag was on the U.S. Navy's LCC 60, one of just three advanced fleet vessels directing troops onto Utah Beach in German-occupied France on June 6, 1944. 
Howard Vander Beek, who commanded the vessel as a Navy lieutenant, kept the flag throughout the war, brought it home and kept it in his basement until he died in 2014. It was sold at auction by his family two years later and bought by Dutch collector Bert Kreuk for $514,000.
""It was pierced by German machine gun bullets and ripped by the wind,"" said Kreuk. ""The flag will be going home.""
Kreuk, who ran a business in the United States for 20 years, wants to donate it to the American people and hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump will come pick it up in the Netherlands. 
Dozens of U.S. and Dutch soldiers stood at attention as the tattered flag, stained by diesel fumes and dirt, arrived at Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum in a military convoy headed by a U.S. Sherman tank.
Rotterdam's orchestra played ""Fanfare for the Common Man"", written in 1942 by U.S. composer Aaron Copland, as the flag was laid into a display case by soldiers. 
U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Piet Hoekstra said he has discussed the flag with high-level U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
""We are making sure that the White House is aware of this opportunity,"" said Hoekstra. ""Vander Beek carried it in his backpack across significant parts of Europe until the end of the war. They are all special, this one is maybe a little bit more unique,"" Hoekstra said.

The flag will be on display in Rotterdam until Feb. 17.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When plans for a summit between the European Union and the Arab League were first hatched last year, it was envisioned as the start of a new friendship across the Mediterranean. What a difference a few months makes.
The EU hopes that improving ties with its Arab neighbors would help advance its policies, not least its aim to fight illegal immigration from the Middle East and North Africa.
But after the murder of a journalist in a Saudi consulate last October, European officials helping to prepare for the Feb. 24-25 summit in Egypt say they are now focused mainly on limiting the awkwardness.
""The idea was to give them red carpet treatment and start engaging with them more, see what we can do on migration,"" said one European diplomat. ""But now we are in an unlucky spot as some of the (Arab League) national leaders are not our favorites.""
With barely three weeks to go before the summit, top EU leaders have yet to confirm their participation.
A lower-level meeting of Arab League and EU foreign ministers intended to set up an agenda for the summit ended on Monday in Brussels with no agreement on a joint statement.
As top EU diplomat Federica Mogherini was explaining to a news conference why they had failed to agree, she was interrupted by her co-chair, the Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit.
There were ""more complications on the European side than the Arab side,"" Aboul Gheit said. In a friendly but public sign of disagreement, Mogherini snapped back: ""I would say the contrary.""
The EU wants to focus at this month's summit on migration, but that is a fraught area in which EU member states disagree sharply among themselves. Hungary, led by an anti-immigration hardliner, vetoed Monday's joint declaration over the subject.
""This summit has been very difficult to organize, to find a date, nobody really wants this,"" another EU official said of the top-level talks later this month.
""For the EU it is all about migration, but there are so many other touchy subjects that people would rather not address.""
SAUDI, SUDAN AND SYRIA
A key change in the European-Arab relationship in recent months has been the collapse in the global standing of the wealthy and influential Arab leader, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The West's relationship with Saudi Arabia -- the world's biggest exporter of oil and second biggest importer of arms -- has been the bedrock of its ties to the Arab world for decades.
But the de facto ruler has been shunned since U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Riyadh initially denied the killing, then gave conflicting accounts. It now accepts that its agents killed him but says its leadership had nothing to do with it.
Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, arrived at Monday's meeting in Brussels speaking as if little had changed: the sides faced common challenges ""like countering extremism and terrorism,"" he said. ""There are also big offers related to trade and investment.""
But relations are not what they once were. Attending an event with the crown prince is tricky for some European leaders who were already accused by rights groups of rubbing shoulders with him at a meeting of the G20 industrialized countries in November, European sources said.
Nor is Crown Prince Mohammed the only potentially awkward guest for the EU. In recent weeks, Arab states have been showing solidarity with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who has been facing the most sustained anti-government demonstrations at home of his 30 years in power. 
Bashir, wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in the Hague, is persona non grata for some Europeans.
""We don't deal with him directly, but we deal with Sudan,"" an EU official said. ""They could send somebody else.""
A guest even more unwelcome to the Europeans will not be invited to this summit, but could be at a future one soon: Syria's Bashar al-Assad.
Hostility to Assad has long been an issue on which European countries agreed with the leading Arab states, which suspended Damascus from the Arab League in 2011. But with Assad's future now all but secured by Russian and Iranian forces, some Arab countries are pushing to readmit Syria. Most EU countries are not ready to rehabilitate him.
""We are not in a situation today to renew a normal relationship with Syria,"" Belgium's Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said on Monday.
However, Austria and the Czech Republic are more amenable, hopeful that restoring ties with Assad would help Syrian refugees return home. 
""Preparations for the summit are going very slowly, it's all rather uncomfortable,"" one EU diplomat said, but stressed there were no plans to call the whole thing off.

VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini betrayed the principles of the Iranian revolution after sweeping to power in 1979, his first president told Reuters, leaving a ""very bitter"" taste among some of those who had returned with him to Tehran in triumph.
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, a sworn opponent of Tehran’s clerical rulers ever since being driven from office and fleeing abroad in 1981, recalled how 40 years ago in Paris, he had been convinced that the religious leader's Islamic revolution would pave the way for democracy and human rights after the rule of the Shah.
""When we were in France everything we said to him he embraced and then announced it like Koranic verses without any hesitation,"" Bani-Sadr, now 85, said in an interview at his home in Versailles, outside Paris, where he has lived since 1981. 
""We were sure that a religious leader was committing himself and that all these principles would happen for the first time in our history,"" he said. 
Khomeini fled Iran in the mid-1960s, fearing a crackdown on his teachings by the Shah, eventually settling in a modest house in a village outside Paris from where he fomented unrest in Iran and nurtured the future Islamist revolution.
Bani-Sadr, son of a senior Shi'ite Muslim cleric and a former student of economics in Paris, had close family ties with Khomeini and helped him move to France after periods in Turkey and Iraq, becoming one of his closest aides. 
""France was the crossroads of ideas and information, which is why he picked it after Kuwait refused to take him,"" Bani-Sadr said. ""When he was in France he was on the side of freedom. He was scared that the movement wouldn't reach its conclusion and he'd be forced to stay there."" 
MULLAHS
For Western observers, at least, Khomenei appeared to endorse a more modern interpretation of Islam in which religion and politics were kept separate and Iran would move away from the Shah's dictatorship, Bani-Sadr said.
""It was when he came down the steps from the plane in Iran where he changed ... The mullahs got a hold of him and gave him a new destiny, which is the dictatorship we see today,"" he said.
Bani-Sadr was elected president on Feb. 5, 1980, in a popular vote, but under the new Islamic Republic's constitution, Khomenei wielded the real power - a situation that has continued since his death in 1989 under his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
Bani-Sadr recounted how he went to see Khomenei, now known as the Supreme Leader, in the city of Qom a few months after their return to bemoan pressure from religious authorities to force women to wear the veil. He said this went against promises he made in Paris that women should have a right to choose.
""(Khomeini) told me he had said things in France that were convenient, but that he was not locked into everything he had said there and that if he felt it necessary to say the opposite he would,"" Bani-Sadr said.
""For me it was a very, very bitter moment."" 
Despite such disappointment and his long exile, Bani-Sadr said he did not regret having been part of the revolution. 
But he warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to bring Tehran to heel through economic sanctions would backfire, hurting ordinary Iranians while reinforcing the existing system. 

""If Mr Trump left Iran alone, you'd see that the system is a lot more fragile than one imagines. We don't need a new revolution,"" he said.

Germany leads a NATO force of 1,200 troops from 10 countries sent to Lithuania two years ago as part of NATO's effort to beef up defenses along eastern Europe's borders with Russia after its 2014 annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.
""We want to make clear that Lithuania is not alone and will never stand alone. It will never again have to sacrifice its freedom and independence,"" Ursula von der Leyen told reporters during a visit to the German forces.
""We will stay here with the Bundeswehr (German armed forces) as long as we're needed, and as long as the security situation requires it.""
Von der Leyen said the German deployment had bolstered joint training efforts and improved the ability to deploy on missions if needed.
Germany will invest 50 million euros this year in a joint barracks shared by NATO forces and in other facilities, with spending to total 110 million euros by 2021, she said.
Welcoming her comments, Lithuanian Defence Minister Raimundas Karoblis said: ""This is the first time we have heard so clearly and from such a high political level that Germany is here for the long term, until the security situation changes.""
Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, joined NATO along with the two other Baltic states Latvia and Estonia and a number of other ex-communist nations in 2004.
The three Baltic states, which were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and secured their independence only with the fall of communism, were rattled by Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine.

TOKYO (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday offered a way to break the deadlock over the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, calling for a ""creative"" compromise to allay concerns over the future of Irish border arrangements.
The United Kingdom is due under British and European law to leave the EU in just 53 days yet Prime Minister Theresa May wants last-minute changes to a divorce deal agreed with the EU last November to win over lawmakers in the British parliament.
May is seeking legally binding changes to the deal to replace the Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy that aims to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
While Merkel said she did not want the so-called Withdrawal Agreement renegotiated, she added that difficult questions could be resolved with creativity, the strongest hint to date that the EU's most powerful leader could be prepared to compromise.
""There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market even when Northern Ireland isn't part of it because it is part of Britain while at the same time meeting the desire to have, if possible, no border controls,"" Merkel said.
""To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted,"" Merkel said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. 
Merkel said the Irish backstop issue could be solved as part of a discussion over a separate agreement on the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, offering May a potential way out of the deadlock.
Merkel's stance on Brexit is driven by an eagerness to preserve the integrity of the EU and its internal market, which are crucial to Germany's post-war identity and prosperity, while also keeping Britain close to the bloc even after it leaves.
Keen to avoid the economic disruption a no-deal Brexit would bring to Germany's economy, which slowed sharply last year, Merkel also values Britain as a like-minded partner and wants to keep its security expertise close at hand.
""We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreement if everyone shows good will,"" Merkel said.
LAST-MINUTE DEAL?
Britain's labyrinthine crisis over EU membership is approaching its finale with an array of options including no-deal Brexit, a last-minute deal, a snap election or a delay.
May said she would seek a pragmatic solution when she tries to reopen talks with Brussels though Brexit-supporting lawmakers in her Conservative Party have warned they will vote against her deal unless there are substantial changes.
In Brussels, a group of British lawmakers met the head of the EU civil service and said Martin Selmayr appeared to indicate that the EU might bind itself to new legal conditions.
While European Commission Secretary General Selmayr, the long-time lieutenant of President Jean-Claude Juncker, had reiterated the EU line that it would not reopen the withdrawal agreement, Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn told reporters: ""I got the impression that they might be prepared to consider some additional statement or legal protocol.""
But Selmayr was quick to fire back on Twitter: ""On the EU side, nobody is considering this.""
The German EU official said the lawmakers gave ""inconclusive"" answers when he asked whether any EU assurances could help May win support for her deal.
Selmayr has been in charge of the bloc's preparations for the event of Britain failing to agree on an orderly withdrawal and his role in meeting the lawmakers was seen by some British commentators as a sign of a harder line from Brussels than that from Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, a former French minister.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi President Barham Salih said on Monday that President Donald Trump did not ask Iraq's permission for U.S. troops stationed there to ""watch Iran.""
Speaking at a forum in Baghdad, Salih was responding to a question about Trump's comments to CBS about how he would ask troops stationed in Iraq to ""watch"" Iran.
U.S. troops in Iraq are there as part of an agreement between the two countries with a specific mission of combating terrorism, Salih said, and that they should stick to that.
Trump said it was important to keep a U.S. military presence in Iraq so that Washington can keep a close eye on Iran ""because Iran is a real problem,"" according to a CBS interview broadcast on Sunday.
""Don't overburden Iraq with your own issues,"" Salih said. ""The U.S. is a major power ... but do not pursue your own policy priorities, we live here.""
Iraq is in a difficult position as tensions between its two biggest allies, the United States and Iran, increase.

""It is of fundamental interest for Iraq to have good relations with Iran"" and other neighboring countries, Salih said.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Outgoing Congo government defends golden parachutes,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s outgoing government on Monday defended decrees granting former ministers lifetime salaries and other benefits following strong criticism in a country where most of the population lives in poverty.
Prime Minster Bruno Tshibala, who is due to submit his government's resignation to new President Felix Tshisekedi in the coming days, signed the decrees last November, but they were only widely reported in the media last week.
One provides for former prime ministers, starting with Tshibala, to receive a monthly salary equivalent to 30 percent of the current prime minister's, a monthly housing stipend of $5,000 and health care overseas.
The other decree calls for former ministers to receive monthly salaries equal to 30 percent of the current minister's, a $1,000 monthly housing stipend and one international flight per year in business class.
A typical minister's monthly salary is nearly $4,000.
Reports of the decrees' provisions drew outcry from across the political spectrum, with one human rights activist, George Kapiamba, labelling it ""an attempt to perpetuate a system of the pillage of public funds"".
Patrick Nkanga, an adviser to President Joseph Kabila who stepped down last month to make way for Tshisekedi, also criticized the measure.
""Granting so many lifetime privileges to an entire former government is not consistent with our socio-economic context,"" Nkanga wrote on Twitter. ""It is excessive and needlessly costly for the public treasury.""
Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Tshibangu Kalala, an adviser to Tshibala, said the decree was consistent with other laws granting benefits to retired officials, including former presidents and judges.
""The modest material advantages recognized for former high state officials...are not intended to enrich these officials but to grant them a vital minimum (salary) so they don't fall ... into indigence and precariousness,"" Kalala said.
Congo is Africa's leading copper producer and the world's top miner of cobalt, which is essential to electric car batteries, but it remains one of the world's least developed countries due largely to poor governance and corruption.
Kabila's anti-corruption czar estimated in 2015 that Congo loses up to $15 billion a year due to fraud. The annual state budget is about $5 billion.

Tshisekedi has promised to crack down on corruption, but critics question whether he will have the authority to tackle the well-entrenched networks that perpetuate it.

Nazarbayev, 78, who has run the former Soviet republic for three decades and has no apparent successor, was last re-elected in 2015, securing a five-year term with 97.7 percent of the vote.
But country-watchers say there are signs he might seek re-election in a snap poll this year. Nazarbayev's government has, for example, taken several populist steps, such as raising public-sector salaries and forcing utilities to cut and freeze tariffs.
""Although we cannot say with certainty that an early election lies ahead, it is almost a certainty that the incumbent President Nursultan Nazarbayev will be re-elected to office,"" Fitch Solutions said in a note last month said.
The brief Constitutional Council statement published on Friday did not explain what exactly Nazarbayev has asked it to clarify.

Article 42 of the constitution, whose interpretation he has requested, says a president's term ends either when another elected president assumes office, or in the case of an incumbent leader's ""premature release from office, resignation or death"".

351,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>","As death toll keeps rising, U.S. communities start rethinking Taser use","By Tim Reid, Peter Eisler and Grant Smith
(Reuters) - Warren Ragudo died after two Taser shocks by police intervening in a family altercation. Ramzi Saad died after a Taser shock by police during a dispute between Saad and his mother. Chinedu Okobi died after police used a Taser to subdue him in a confrontation they blamed on his refusal to stop walking in traffic. 
All three were unarmed. All three had histories of mental illness. And all three died last year in a single northern California county, San Mateo.
They were among at least 49 people who died in 2018 after being shocked by police with a Taser, a similar number as in the previous two years, according to a Reuters review of police records, news reports and court documents.
The deaths typically draw little public scrutiny – no government agency tracks how often Tasers are used or how many of those deployments prove fatal, and coroners and medical examiners use varying standards to assess a Taser's role in a death. But some communities now are considering more restrictive Taser policies following allegations that the weapons were used excessively or deployed against people with physical or mental conditions that put them at higher risk of death or injury.
Reuters has contacted 14 police departments, counties and cities that saw a Taser-related death or other serious Taser-related incident in 2018. Of those, five are reviewing their Taser policies; three had conducted reviews and made no changes; and five declined comment because investigations into the incidents were still ongoing.
Reuters now has documented a total of at least 1,081 U.S. deaths following use of Tasers, almost all since the weapons began coming into widespread use in the early 2000s. In many of those cases, the Taser, which fires a pair of barbed darts that deliver a paralyzing electrical charge, was combined with other force, such as hand strikes or restraint holds.
(Graphic: https://reut.rs/2sXSdHS)
Following the three San Mateo deaths, all within nine months, the county board of supervisors and the district attorney launched ongoing reviews of the use and safety of Tasers, which were touted by police and the weapon’s manufacturer as a near-perfect, “non-lethal” weapon when they began coming into widespread use more than a decade ago. 
There is a need to reevaluate “the proper role for Tasers and how and when they are engaged,” Dave Pine, a member of the Board of Supervisors told Reuters. Until then, “I personally think it would be appropriate to have a moratorium on their use.”
Most independent researchers who have studied Tasers say deaths are rare when they are used properly, but in a series of reports in 2017, Reuters found that many police officers are not trained properly on the risks and weapons are often misused.
(https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-taser)
Reuters was able to obtain cause-of-death data for 779 of the 1,081 deaths it has documented and the Taser was deemed a cause or contributing factor in 21 percent of those. 
Axon Enterprise Inc , the Taser’s manufacturer, says most deaths involving the weapons are a result of drug use, underlying physiological conditions, such as heart problems, or other police force used along with the Taser.
Axon argues that most cause-of-death rulings implicating its weapons are misinformed and said in an email that Tasers albeit ""not risk free"" are ""the most safe and effective less-lethal use of force tool available to law enforcement.”
RECOGNIZING THE RISKS
Reuters reporting, which included the most complete accounting to date of fatalities following Taser shocks, showed that many cases involved high-risk subjects, such as people agitated by drugs or mental illness, people with heart problems, people who are very young or very old or very frail.
At least half those who died after Taser shocks last year fell into one or more of those categories. As in previous years, about 90 percent were unarmed and nearly a quarter had a history of mental illness.
As police departments have become more aware of Tasers’ risks and limitations, a growing number have restricted their use, says Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) think tank. Still, many officers remain unaware of the hazards when they encounter those vulnerable to a Taser's shock, Wexler warns. 
“That’s a big problem.” 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, one of the nation’s largest police forces, drafted a new Taser policy last year that would put new restrictions on the weapons' deployment, according to an official familiar with the initiative. The policy awaits final approval from the department’s new leadership, which took over after November’s elections.
In Cincinnati, the police department is reviewing its Taser policy after an 11-year-old girl was shocked last year, said Lt. Steve Saunders, a spokesman. In Chula Vista, California, an automatic review is under way following the death of Jason Watts, 29, who died in October after police shocked him in a confrontation at a store, spokesman Capt. Phil Collum said.
Public discourse over Tasers’ safety has been especially heated in San Francisco, where the Board of Supervisors voted in June to block funding for the police department’s long-debated plan to purchase the weapons. 
Nationally, there are no uniform standards governing police use of Tasers, although PERF and the International Association of Chiefs of Police offer model guidelines that warn against using Tasers on vulnerable populations and limit the number and duration of shocks during deployment.
Axon said it offers police departments “the latest public-safety best practices and training” for Taser use, including warnings about vulnerable populations. The company also offers “de-escalation training” to help officers resolve conflicts without Tasers, as well as “empathy training for special populations, including the mentally ill.”
CONCERNS IN SAN MATEO
In San Mateo, the county coroner ruled the death of Ramzi Saad a homicide: ""cardiac arrest occurring during physical exertion, physical restraint and tasering.""
Police visited the Redwood City home where Saad, 55, lived with his mother on Aug. 13 after a neighbor witnessed him shoving his mother during an argument and called 911.
Saad, who suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, diabetes and high blood pressure, was shocked with a Taser at least twice after threatening an officer, then lost consciousness as he was pinned to the ground by other police, investigators later found. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.
Stephen Wagstaffe, the county’s district attorney, found the officers’ response justified, but a second death in 2018 after a Taser shock made local officials take notice. 
Two months later, the questions about Taser use grew more urgent: Chinedu Okobi, 36, died on Oct. 3 after being shocked by San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies in Millbrae. 
The deaths have raised major concerns, Wagstaffe told Reuters. He said he has directed staff “to come up with as much information as possible on Taser-related deaths."" The results of the fact-gathering exercise will go to the sheriff and the county’s 15 municipal police chiefs “to help them in their judgment on the future use of Tasers,” Wagstaffe said.
The district attorney is conducting a separate, formal investigation into whether the deputies who confronted Okobi before his death committed any crimes. That inquiry should be completed by the end of the month and will be made public, Wagstaffe told Reuters.
While Pine favors a moratorium on Taser use during the review, several municipal police chiefs told Reuters they preferred to wait for Wagstaffe’s Okobi investigation before deciding whether to alter policies. The sheriff’s department, which operates countywide, is against a moratorium. Carlos Bolanos, the San Mateo County Sheriff, said he was awaiting results of Wagstaffe's report into Okobi's death before his department conducts its own internal review into the death.

Meanwhile, Okobi’s death has become a flashpoint in the county’s debate over Taser use. The sheriff's department and Okobi's sister Ebele, a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive, have offered conflicting accounts about the events surrounding Okobi's death. The Board of Supervisors will hold a public meeting on Feb. 11 to discuss law enforcement's Taser use. Presenters will include officials from Axon, the county sheriff's office, the American Civil Liberties Union and Dr. Zian Tseng, a cardiologist, Pine said.

Every Saudi woman is assigned a male relative - often a father or husband but sometimes an uncle, brother or even a son - whose approval is needed to marry, obtain a passport and travel abroad.
Rights groups say the arrangement turns women into second-class citizens, depriving them of social and economic freedoms and making them more vulnerable to violence.
Without a codified system of law to go with the texts making up sharia, or Islamic law, the Saudi police and judiciary have long cited social customs in enforcing certain prohibitions on women. Many aspects of guardianship stem from informal practices rather than specific laws.
Saudi public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb said his office would ""spare no efforts in protecting individuals, whether women, children or parents, from unfair treatment by those who abuse guardianship powers,"" according to English daily Saudi Gazette.
His office receives only a small number of complaints about guardianship, he added, without providing details.
The government communications office was not immediately available for comment.
Activists say many Saudi women fear that reporting abuse to the police would only further endanger their lives. They have called for an end to guardianship, which has slowly eroded over the years but remains in force.
Some freedoms have been granted under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who ended a ban on women driving and eased restrictions on gender mixing, but they have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the arrest and alleged torture of women's rights activists as well as Muslim clerics.
Prince Mohammed indicated last year he favored ending the guardianship system but stopped short of backing its annulment.
The plight of Rahaf Mohammed, who slipped away from her family last month during a holiday in Kuwait and then tweeted calls for help from Bangkok airport, sparked an online campaign that ended with the Thai authorities reversing a decision to send her home and Canada granting her asylum.
Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most gender-segregated nations, is ranked 138 of 144 states in the 2017 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Pope Francis, the first pontiff to set foot on the peninsula where Islam was born, met United Arab Emirates leaders in Abu Dhabi on Monday in a historic trip he hopes will foster peace through religious dialogue.
Arriving at the sprawling presidential palace with its many domes of gold and glass, Francis was greeted with a flyover by UAE air force jets spewing out plumes of smoke in yellow and white - the colors of the Vatican flag. 
He rode to the main courtyard in a small car escorted by a dozen flag-bearing Emirati guards on horseback. He shunned bulletproof cars or limousines since the start of his papacy.
Once inside the palace, a 370 acre (150 hectares) maze of buildings, gardens and fountains, Francis held private talks with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and other UAE leaders.
Writing in the palace guest book, he asked that God grant the UAE ""divine blessings of peace and fraternal solidarity"".
The visit takes place in the shadow of the war in Yemen, the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation, where the UAE military has a leading role in a Saudi-led coalition fighting on the side of the internationally recognized Yemeni government that was ousted by the Iran-allied Houthi group.
Francis was due to deliver his only public address of the day later at an inter-religious meeting following a visit to Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, one of the largest in the Islamic world.
The visit received some positive media attention in neighboring Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and where churches are banned. The main English daily, Arab News, ran a picture of the pope and Abu Dhabi's crown prince calling it ""the moment that made history on the Arabian Peninsula.""
It ran an article citing Muslim and Catholic officials saying Saudi Arabia could feature in a future papal visit.
Priests and diplomats describe the UAE as one of the least restrictive environments in the Gulf for Christian worship, which is allowed in church compounds with special licenses. But like other Gulf states it outlaws unsanctioned religious gatherings and non-Muslims must not proselytize.
SHADOW OF YEMEN WAR
Vatican officials said before the trip that it was not clear whether the pope would address the subject of the nearly four-year Yemen war in public or private during the trip.
The United Nations is trying to implement a fragile ceasefire deal in Yemen's main Hodeidah port, a lifeline for millions and the site of some of the war's fiercest battles. It hopes the deal will pave the way for political negotiations to end the conflict.
Shortly before departing for Abu Dhabi on Sunday, Francis said he was following the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with great concern, using his regular Sunday address in Vatican City to urge all sides to implement the deal and help deliver aid.
""Let us pray strongly because they are children who are hungry, who are thirsty, they don't have medicine and they are in danger of death,"" he said.
The war pitting the Houthi movement against the Saudi-led coalition loyal to ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi has killed tens of thousands of people and left almost 16 million people facing severe hunger.
On Tuesday, before returning to Rome, the pope will celebrate an outdoor mass for some 135,000 Catholics in an Abu Dhabi sports stadium, an event with no precedent in the peninsula. He has said the trip would write ""a new page in the history of relations between religions"".

The UAE is home to around 1 million expatriate Catholics, many from the Philippines. Another 1 million Catholics are believed to live in other countries in the Arabian Peninsula.

KABUL (Reuters) - Senior Afghan officials warned on Monday that talks this week between Taliban militants and opposition politicians, including former President Hamid Karzai, betrayed the principles of democracy and Afghanistan's best interests.
The talks, starting on Tuesday in Moscow, come 10 days after peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban in Qatar ended with signs of progress toward the withdrawal of thousands of foreign troops from Afghanistan and an end to more than 17 years of war.
The push for peace comes as the Taliban, ousted by U.S.-led forces in 2001, have staged near daily attacks and are in control of or contesting districts across nearly half the country.
Moscow had decided to snub Afghan government officials, sources said, to ensure the participation of the Taliban who refuse to hold talks with representatives of Western-backed President Ashraf Ghani, branding them puppets of the United States. 
Fazel Fazly, chief adviser to Ghani, expressed ""regret"" that politicians who previously led Afghanistan's democratic transition were to meet the Taliban.
""(They) are ready to bypass these principles and move toward (the principles') destruction due to differences and being away from power,"" Fazly said in a Tweet. 
Abdullah Abdullah, the government's chief executive, said the Taliban would have achieved their objective once foreign troops withdrew, ending the need for talks.
The United States has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission and a separate counter-terrorism effort largely directed at groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.
Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries are also involved in Resolute Support.
Also shut out of the U.S. discussions at the insistence of the Taliban, the Afghan government is alarmed at the prospect of the Taliban forcing their way into an interim government.
The Moscow talks will be closely watched by Western diplomats, some of whom fear they could complicate the U.S. talks with the Taliban led by Washington's special peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, while potentially isolating Ghani.
While Russian officials are expected to remain in the background, the Moscow talks highlight the growing role Russia is playing in Afghanistan.
Karzai confirmed his attendance at the talks, saying in a tweet he would carry a message of ""peace, unity sovereignty and progress for all of us"".
Karzai replaced the Taliban's hardline Islamist rule as Afghanistan's first democratically elected leader after the Islamists were ousted by U.S.-backed Afghan forces, supported by U.S. air power.
Another delegate to the Moscow sessions, Mohammad Hanif Atmar, an influential former national security adviser to Ghani, said they would emphasize the need to include the government in future intra-Afghan discussions.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nigerian candidate's U.S. visit was temporary reprieve from graft ban,"By Andy Sullivan, Lesley Wroughton and Paul Carsten
WASHINGTON/ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar visited Washington two weeks ago to meet with top U.S. diplomats and lawmakers thanks to a temporary suspension of a travel ban linked to decade-old bribery scandals, according to people familiar with the matter.
The U.S. administration has not commented on Atiku's status or his travel, but several U.S. diplomats and others familiar with the visit told Reuters the former vice president has been banned from entering the United States for the past several years after he figured prominently in two corruption cases. 
For Atiku's supporters, the fact he was able to visit Washington on Jan. 17 and 18 without being arrested was proof that the allegations were baseless.
""It is fake news, and we showed that,"" said Harold Molokwu, who heads the U.S. chapter of Atiku's People's Democratic Party of Nigeria.
Several U.S. government officials said the travel ban was waived temporarily by the U.S. State Department after lobbyists mounted a campaign among congressional lawmakers arguing that the administration should not snub the leading challenger to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the Feb. 16 election.
One person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Atiku was allowed to enter because the United States saw little benefit to creating bad blood with the man who might be the next leader of Africa's most populous nation and the continent's biggest oil producer.
Lobbyists hired by Atiku said they sought to overcome resistance at the State Department by securing support from members of Congress for the visit, as well as arguing that the top U.S. official for African affairs, Assistant Secretary Tibor Nagy, had an obligation to encourage democracy in the seventh most populous country in the world. 
""Assistant Secretary Nagy was pleased to meet with him and share the U.S. government's expectations that Nigeria's elections be free, fair, transparent, and peaceful, and reflect the will of the Nigerian people,"" a State Department official said, stressing the department had not requested the waiver.
Buhari first took power in a military coup in the 1980s but was democratically elected in 2015. He is seeking a second term in part on an anti-corruption platform.
Atiku's visa troubles stem from when he served as Nigeria's vice president, from 1999 to 2007. 
He figured prominently in the corruption trial of former U.S. Representative William Jefferson, who was accused of trying to bribe Atiku in an effort to expand a technology business in Nigeria. Jefferson was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. His sentence was subsequently reduced. 
Separately U.S. Senate investigators in 2010 alleged that one of Atiku's four wives helped him transfer more than $40 million in ""suspect funds"" into the United States from offshore shell companies.
At least $1.7 million of that money was bribes paid by German technology company  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), according to Senate investigators. Siemens pleaded guilty to bribery charges in 2008 and agreed to pay a $1.6 billion fine.
Atiku has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Neither he nor his wife face criminal charges in the United States.
""These issues have been addressed several times in the past and we do not wish to comment further on them,"" a spokesman for Atiku said when asked about the corruption allegations. 
WHIRLWIND VISIT
Atiku's whirlwind visit to Washington last month was put together with the help of two U.S. lobbying firms. 
Holland & Knight was hired by Atiku personally in December to help him secure a visa, in part by enlisting members of Congress to request one on his behalf, according to a lobbyist for the firm. It has been paid $80,000 so far.
Ballard Partners was hired by Atiku's political party at a rate of $90,000 per month in September, before Atiku emerged as the party's candidate, according to U.S. disclosure filings.
The firm's lobbyists worked to set up a meeting with Nagy, arguing it would show that the United States wanted to encourage free and fair elections in a country where graft is endemic.
""We are not asking the administration or anyone to take sides, but to merely demand the same level of freeness and fairness,"" Ballard lobbyist Jamie Rubin told Reuters.
Aside from Nagy, Atiku met with business leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and at least two Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives who specialize in foreign affairs, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey. 
Neither requested a visa waiver for Atiku, spokespeople for the two congressmen said.
Atiku stayed at the Trump International Hotel, owned by the president, and met with several hundred Nigerian expatriates there, according to two people who attended the gathering.
The luxury hotel is the subject of several lawsuits that allege Trump is violating an anti-corruption clause in the U.S. Constitution that limits the president's ability to accept gifts from foreign governments.
Atiku's supporters say they chose the hotel because they were able to book rooms at a discounted rate with only a few days' notice.
""I think it was because of the availability of the space,"" said Uche Udemadu, an official with the U.S. chapter of the People's Democratic Party of Nigeria.

A spokeswoman for the hotel declined to comment.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>",Major European nations recognize Guaido as Venezuela president,"By Jose Elías Rodríguez and Sudip Kar-Gupta
MADRID/PARIS (Reuters) - Eight European nations joined the United States in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president on Monday, heightening the global showdown over Nicolas Maduro's socialist rule.
Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Germany's coordinated move came after the expiry of an eight-day deadline set last weekend for Maduro to call a new election. 
The Venezuelan leader, accused of running the OPEC nation of 30 million people like a dictatorship and wrecking its economy, has defied them, saying Europe's ruling elite are sycophantically following President Donald Trump's agenda.
Guaido, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself temporary leader last month in a move that has split international powers and brought Venezuelans onto the streets. 
Trump immediately recognized him but European Union nations were nervous over the global precedent of a self-declaration. 
Russia and China, who have poured billions of dollars of investment and loans into Venezuela, are supporting Maduro in an extension of a geopolitical tussle with the United States playing out across various global flashpoints.
""I recognize the president of Venezuela's assembly, Mr Juan Guaido, as president in charge of Venezuela,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised statement, urging a free and fair election as soon as possible.
""CREDIBLE ELECTIONS""
""Venezuelans have the right to express themselves freely and democratically. France recognizes @jguaido as 'interim president' to implement an electoral process,"" President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said via social media. ""UK alongside European allies now recognizes @jguaido as interim constitutional president until credible elections can be held.""
He added: ""The oppression of the illegitimate, kleptocratic Maduro regime must end.""
Maduro, 56, a former union leader, bus driver and foreign leader, replaced former leader Hugo Chavez in 2013 after his death from cancer. But he has presided over an economic collapse and exodus of 3 million Venezuelans. 
He blames a U.S.-led ""economic war"" and also accuses Washington of seeking a coup against him in order to get its hands on Venezuela's oil wealth. It has the largest reserves in the world, but production has plunged under Maduro.
Critics say incompetent policies and corruption under both Maduro and Chavez have impoverished a once-wealthy nation while dissent has been brutally crushed.
Responding to the EU nations' moves on Monday, Russia said it was foreign meddling and Venezuelans should be allowed to resolve their own domestic problems. The Maduro government is paying back both Russian and Chinese loans with oil. 
In addition to the European pressure, a major bloc of Latin American nations plus Canada were to meet on Monday seeking to maintain their pressure on Maduro.
Maduro won re-election last year, but critics say it was a sham. Two opposition rivals with a good chance of winning were barred from standing, while food handouts and other subsidies to hungry Venezuelans were linked with political support.

Non-EU member Switzerland expressed concern and urged a ""constitutional solution"" and protection for Guaido, but did not specifically recognize him as president.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded at a shopping mall in Somalia's capital on Monday, killing two people and injuring four others in an attack probably by Islamist group al Shabaab, police said.
The blast occurred in Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district, a busy area with shops and restaurants.
""So far, we know two civilians died and four others were injured. It was a car bomb that exploded in front of a Mogadishu shopping mall,"" a police officer, Mohamed Hussein, told Reuters.
The number of casualties may rise, he said.
A Reuters witness saw one dead person at the scene, where four cars burned and a restaurant was destroyed.
Al Shabaab frequently carries out bombings in Mogadishu and other parts of Somalia against government and other targets. 
The group is trying to remove the Western-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law.
Al Shabaab's militants also carry out attacks outside Somalia, especially in Kenya to pressure it to withdraw troops who form part of an African peacekeeping force that helps defend the central government.

Its latest assault in Kenya, a suicide and gun attack at an office and hotel complex in the capital Nairobi last month, killed 21 people.

Two other people suffered moderate burns, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Yorba Linda lies 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles. 
The twin-engine Cessna 414A crashed about 10 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, scattering debris over four blocks in the town and setting fire to a house, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Two men and two women were killed in the blaze, the newspaper said.
Resident Nancy Mehl, 65, said she heard the high-pitched whine of an airplane engine and took cover in her home with her two dogs. 
""And then it felt like a bomb went off through the front of the house,"" she told the newspaper.
Flying debris smashed through windows and a propeller crashed in her driveway, while a burning wing landed in another resident's front yard, according to the newspaper.
Police and fire officials evacuated the neighborhood, and police dispatchers say the fire is under investigation.
The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the wreck, police dispatchers said. A spokesperson for the NTSB was not immediately available early Monday.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",Unpalatable numbers: statistician who rocked Indian government had to take a stand,"By Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - P.C. Mohanan grew up in a village without electricity, studied statistics at a public university, and then spent more than three decades crunching numbers for the Indian government.
But in the past week, the mild-mannered official has been caught up in a political storm that has threatened to undermine Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government months before a general election.
On Jan. 28, Mohanan resigned as acting chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), a government-funded advisory body that checks the quality of India’s official data, in protest at a delay in releasing a new set of jobs statistics. Another member of the NSC, J. Meenakshi, quit with him. 
Three days later, some of those jobs numbers were leaked to the Business Standard newspaper, which reported that India’s unemployment rate in the year ending June 2018 rose to 6.1 percent, its highest level in at least 45 years.
The figures are potentially crucial before the election, due to be held by May, as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) struggles to win over voters concerned about depressed farm incomes and a lack of job creation. India needs to create more than a million jobs each month just to find employment for young people entering the workforce.
Officials from NITI Aayog, a government think tank formed by Modi in 2015 that is not normally involved in official releases of economic data, have rejected the job numbers reported by the Business Standard. They said the report was still in “draft” form and argued that more quarterly data was required to publish a “comparable” jobs report. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also told Reuters news partner ANI the report was a draft ""which has not been approved.""
But in an interview with Reuters this weekend, Mohanan, 63, says he has no regrets about walking out in protest at the delay.
He said the NSC, which was supposed to be the final authority on statistics before they were published, had been repeatedly sidelined by the government in recent months, and the delay in the jobs figures was the final straw.
“Data should be released as per the calendar, whether it is to your liking or not liking,” he said. “Otherwise, where is credibility in the system?""
LACK OF SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
It is unclear where the Business Standard got the figures. Mohanan stresses it wasn’t from him, and declined to discuss the specifics of the jobs report with Reuters.
Mohanan, who says he is not active politically, said the NSC approved the report on Dec. 5, and expected it to be released soon after. 
When it didn’t happen, he reached out to top officials, including the chief statistician, Pravin Srivastava, even flying to New Delhi from Mohanan's home in southern India, for a meeting with him in late January. He says he didn't get a satisfactory explanation for the delay in any of those discussions.
With the report still unreleased, Mohanan and Meenakshi quit a few days later. 
Mohanan said he felt it was important that he stood up for the integrity of the organization, the NSSO, where he built his career. He had joined the NSC as a member in 2017, two years after retiring from India’s statistics service, which includes the NSSO.
When he became the acting head in November 2018 he found the NSC’s role had diminished under the Modi government. It was starved of resources and it wasn’t engaged in major statistical initiatives as they should be under ministry guidelines.
There was also a controversy over the release in November of historical GDP data with a new base year, which was used by the government to attack the opposition Congress party. The data showed growth was lower than previously thought during the previous Congress-led government. 
He said his concern was the way NITI Aayog was involved in releasing the numbers. The government think tank said they had been brought in to assess the numbers before that announcement, according to local media. 
As to NITI Aayog’s arguments against publishing the jobs data, both Mohanan and a senior former NSSO official said they are bogus.
“There is no relation between this report and the quarterly data,” the former NSSO official said, requesting anonymity.
Radha Binod Barman, who chaired the NSC between 2016 and 2018, said the National Statistical Commission should have been the final authority on whether to release the jobs report.
NITI Aayog and India's statistics ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment.
For Mohanan, it has been a stressful past week. He realizes this might be the end of his government life but is ready to settle into retirement in the village he grew up in the state of Kerala. 

Having made his point, Mohanan's one big hope is that the NSC and the Indian statistics team will now be shown more respect.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Kenya's ambulance 'Uber' at heart of siege rescue,"By Hereward Holland
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Just minutes after militants attacked a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi last month, the first ambulances roared up to collect wounded survivors. 
Speedy medical help is taken for granted in the West, but many developing nations do not have centralized emergency command. Confusion during past attacks in Kenya cost lives.
This time, the response was far better, partly thanks to Flare, a new ride-hailing app whose ambulances were first to the dusitD2 hotel and office complex hit by Somalia's al Shabaab. 
""Flare was telling us what is happening, how to position our ambulances, how to evacuate, how to ask for additional resources,"" said Kelvin Osano, ambulance fleet manager at the nearby private Avenue Hospital where the injured poured in. 
The four gunmen and suicide bomber killed 21 people, just round the corner from another al Shabaab attack in 2013 that took 67 lives at the Westgate shopping center.
Back then, the medical response was ""horrible,"" Osano said.
There was no triage at the scene. Bleeding patients were bundled into vehicles without being stabilized. A security cordon prevented ambulances from coming close to victims. 
But at the hotel complex, ambulances scrambled by Flare - run by the Rescue.co company - arrived quickly after panicked calls from subscribers who had paid the 2,400 shillings ($24) annual fee. The first ambulance came within 12 minutes, and by the hour 20 were there.
Eric Ogot, a former nurse who mans the Rescue.co hotline, gave first aid by phone to office workers hiding as gunmen roamed. He helped triage patients remotely and assigned drivers. ""Our job would be to try and be the calming presence,"" he said. 
In the absence of official information, Flare's emergency number raced across Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and WhatsApp. 
Soon, it was not just individuals or business customers calling, but relatives of the missing too. 
The nearby Australian High Commission agreed to be an ambulance staging post for Flare. 
Police fed Rescue.co information.
Peter Koome, a paramedic with charity St. John Ambulance, said the improved coordination, along with better training and access, certainly helped save lives. 
Of 30 people badly wounded, all but two survived.
Americans Caitlin Dolkart and Maria Rabinovich founded Rescue.co in 2016. The Flare app works like ride-hailing and food-delivery services and now has tens of thousands of subscribers and 500 ambulances across Kenya. 

Whereas Kenyans with an emergency are used to calling their closest hospital and ambulances often become ensnared in traffic, Flare streamlines services by monitoring ambulance locations and traffic conditions real time. Dolkart said it hopes to expand, both around the region and into fire and security services - building on its experience at dusitD2.

Chang, who denies wrongdoing, has been in custody in South Africa since Dec. 29 and previously dropped his bail application amid competing extradition requests from both the United States and Mozambique.
He is wanted in both countries in relation to loans guaranteed by the Mozambican government, which it failed to disclose, signed off by Chang during his 2005-2015 term as finance minister. 
The lawyer, Stiaan Krause, told Reuters by phone that Chang's defense team had argued he should be granted bail because he is unlikely to be extradited, and is therefore not a flight risk.
""We have no reason to flee,"" he said, adding the team was not concerned by the U.S. request for extradition. 
The state prosecutor on the case is not allowed to talk to the media. The relevant spokeswoman for the National Prosecuting Authority could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The urgent bail application is being heard separately to an ongoing case in a Johannesburg court, which is considering how to deal with the competing requests from both the United States and Mozambique. 

Krause said a decision on bail is not expected until Feb. 15.

MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - The demolition of a wrecked building in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where Islamic State used to execute men they said were gay is already in its third month.
Homeless boys who hunt for scrap in the remains of the former National Insurance Company building work quicker some days than the lone digger perched on its crumbling carcass.
Two years after the battle in which Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul from IS, the authorities do not own enough equipment to clear the rubble littered across the city.
Hundreds of Mosul council's vehicles were destroyed in fighting or used by IS as suicide bombs. Few have been replaced.
Companies hired by the governor on lucrative contracts to make up the shortfall work deliberately slowly, or sometimes do not exist, lawmakers and locals say.
Mosul was held by IS for three years. Under the militant group's strict interpretation of Islamic law, homosexuality is a grave sin punishable by death. But rights activists say those executed in the seven-storey insurance building, now reduced to two floors, were often IS opponents who were falsely accused. 
The digger on top of the building is hired for $300 a day, a laborer at the site said. It often stands idle.
The regional governor denies allegations of fraud and says not enough money is coming to his office to fund rehabilitation.
Many residents are struggling financially. Families forced to build their own homes go into debt, borrowing from friends and living off charity. Others cram into increasingly expensive rented homes. Foreign-funded projects also suffer delays. 
""There's no strategic plan. It's chaos,"" lawmaker Mohamed Nuri Abed Rabbo said.
Poor planning allows mismanagement of reconstruction efforts and alleged corruption, making recovery slow and haphazard. In this environment, residents fear the remnants of IS will again exploit resentment.
""The city's being rebuilt only on paper,"" said Abu Ali Neshwan, a 52-year-old shopkeeper. ""There's no state here. Corruption's everywhere.""
Abdelsattar al-Hibbu, who is in charge of the municipal government -- and is still recognized by Baghdad as such, despite the governor's attempts to remove him -- said the little money allocated to Mosul was being misspent.
""With the amount spent so far on removing rubble, the city could have been completely cleared by now,"" he said by telephone. Of an estimated 7 million tonnes of debris, more than half remains, he said.
Hibbu warned last year that there was simply not enough money to rebuild.
The 2019 state budget allocates $560 million for Mosul's reconstruction, according to two Mosul lawmakers. A U.N. advisor in the city said one estimated cost for one year of rebuilding work was $1.8 billion.
""It's mostly international organizations getting things done. It's ridiculous that money has to come from outside, with Iraq's oil wealth,"" the adviser said. ""Authorities overspend and work takes ages. It should take a few days at most to demolish a large building and cost a few thousand dollars, tops."" 
FEARS THAT ISLAMIC STATE COULD RE-EMERGE 
Nawfal Hammadi al-Sultan, governor of Nineveh province which includes Mosul, dismissed the allegations of mismanagement and overspending.
""Clearing rubble is not being done haphazardly ... but there are some neighborhoods that are so destroyed that there's no solution,"" he said. ""People shouldn't be asking why (reconstruction) is slow. They should be asking why hurry it?""
The clearance work looks anything but organized. Grubby children, who outnumber workmen, load steel rods and window frames onto donkey-drawn carts to sell at scrapyards.
Wheelbarrows are displayed outside shops for residents wanting to do their own work.
Some Mosul families are rebuilding by themselves. Younes Hassan, 67, borrowed $9,000 from friends to rebuild his purple-walled home at the highest point of the Old City, overlooking a bank of the Tigris river strewn with rubble.
""We've borrowed everything -- there's no money from the government, and certainly no bank loans,"" he said. 
Bank transfers to Mosul, which was a Sunni Islamist stronghold even before IS arrived, are banned by authorities over fears over the financing of extremists.
""Ten people live here, but my daughter hasn't come back yet. She's renting in east Mosul for $100 a month that she can't afford,"" Hassan said.
Hassan's family is among those returning to west Mosul, which suffered the worst damage from air strikes in its crowded Old City streets.
Nearly 2 million Iraqis are still displaced by the fight against IS, according to a survey by REACH, a non-governmental organization. Many say they are not ready to go home because of the destruction and lack of services.
Residents worry that the longer it takes to fix Mosul, the easier it will be for groups such as IS to re-emerge and recruit. Conditions that helped IS take over Mosul and other cities in 2014, including corruption and the neglect of Sunni Muslim communities by a Shi'ite-dominated government, remain.
A policeman manning a makeshift checkpoint said he worried most for the children picking around in the rubble. 

""They'll be the next generation of IS -- it thrives on corruption and chaos,"" he said.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",British lawmakers say highest Saudi authorities may be responsible for activists' torture,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three British lawmakers on Monday endorsed reports that women activists detained in Saudi Arabia have been tortured, and said responsibility for what is likely a violation of international law could lie with ""Saudi authorities at the highest level"".
The conclusions of the panel indicate growing uneasiness among Western allies with alleged rights abuses under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto leader who already facing opprobrium over last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
A United Nations investigator is now leading an international inquiry into the murder, which has tarnished the crown prince's standing in the West after he won accolades for seeking to ease social restrictions and end the country's dependence on oil revenues.
Those reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the arrest of over a dozen women's rights campaigners starting last May, most of whom had advocated for the right to drive and an end to the male guardianship system.
Amnesty International said last month it had documented 10 cases of torture and abuse - including sexual harassment, electrocution, flogging and death threats - while the activists were held at an undisclosed location last summer.
Reuters reported earlier that an aide to Prince Mohammed who was fired for his role in the Khashoggi murder personally oversaw the torture of at least one of the women months earlier.
Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, says it does not have political prisoners and denies torture allegations. Officials have said monitoring of activists is needed to ensure social stability.
Yet British lawmakers Crispin Blunt, Layla Moran and Paul Williams (NYSE:WMB) said they found reports by international rights groups and news media to be credible, describing the detainees' treatment as ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"".
The lawmakers, who formed a review panel with prominent lawyers, said the Saudi authorities had also violated international law by holding the detainees incommunicado and denying them access to legal advice.
Culpability rests not only with direct perpetrators but also those who are responsible for or acquiesce to it, they added.
""The Saudi authorities at the highest levels could, in principle, be responsible for the crime of torture,"" their final report said.
The Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment on the report.
Some of the detained women's rights activists have been accused in Saudi media of belonging to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and supporting Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with Riyadh.
The British lawmakers called on the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and review the allegations against them, and to prosecute those responsible for their mistreatment.
They said requests to visit the detainees in Saudi Arabia have gone unanswered.
""The Saudi women activist detainees have been treated so badly as to sustain an international investigation for torture,"" said Blunt, a lawmaker in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party.

""Saudi Arabia stands on the brink. It is not too late to alter course and avert the spiral downwards to catastrophe that the detention of these activists represents,"" he said.

MYANMAR-THAI BORDER (Reuters) - Thousands of people sporting traditional ethnic costumes and Karen rebel fighters showing off their guns marched, sang and danced last week to celebrate 70 years since the start of the struggle for greater autonomy from Myanmar.
Boasting more than 5,000 soldiers, the Karen National Union (KNU) is one of the most powerful and best-established of the country's myriad militia groups that have fought the government since shortly after Myanmar gained independence in 1948.
The KNU's parade served as a reminder that the biggest priority of the Aung San Suu Kyi's administration - ending decades of ethnic wars - remains elusive.
Suu Kyi has struggled to make progress with autonomy-seeking ethnic minority rebels, who have accused her government of a high-handed approach and ignoring their grievances and aspirations.
The KNU celebrations took place at a remote base in the mountains straddling the Myanmar-Thai border.
""The history of the revolution for 70 years is a very rough one. As someone who has been involved in the revolution for 50 years, I can say it's very tough and the sacrifices were very big,"" Man Nyein Maung, one of the KNU's executive members, told the Irrawaddy online news magazine.
The celebrations lasted several days and nights with a folk dance competition and theater performances before a military parade and speeches on a cloud-shrouded, dusty parade ground carved from the hills at the crack of dawn.
A banner hoisted above the grounds listed some of the group's political demands, including calls to ""retain our arms"" and to ""decide our own political destiny"".
One of the dance groups was made up of women wearing yellow scarves, with their hair tied in a bun and an exposed fringe. Their yellow shirts with green patterns contrasted with their white face powder and red lipstick.
The performers mingled with villagers and soldiers of the Karen National Liberation Army, the KNU's armed wing. The men smoked cigarettes as they watched, some with heavy bullet belts draped around automatic rifles, and with insignia in red, white and blue displayed on their uniforms.
The KNU signed a ceasefire with the government in 2012 after more than six decades of conflict that had driven tens of thousands of refugees into Thailand.
Some have come back although about 100,000 remain in the refugee camps on the other side of the border, according to the United Nations. While major clashes have been avoided, the KNU's relations with the Myanmar army remain tense.
Suu Kyi has struggled to secure peace elsewhere in the country and long-simmering conflicts in the north and the west have intensified in recent years.

In 2017, a military offensive drove out 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from the western state of Rakhine to Bangladesh, creating one of the world's largest refugee crises.

The health of Chiwenga, 62, is closely followed in Zimbabwe because he is widely seen as the power behind President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the front-runner to succeed him. The former military general led the coup that ousted long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in 2017.
Mnangagwa last week dismissed rumors of a rift with Chiwenga, which have gathered momentum since he promised action in response to a brutal security crackdown on protests last month while he was abroad.
The privately-owned NewsDay said Chiwenga had initially checked in at a private hospital last week but had to travel to Cape Town, South Africa for further treatment. The paper, quoting sources, did not say what he was being treated for.
George Charamba, spokesman in the presidency, on Monday said he could not immediately comment.
Last October, Charamba said Chiwenga traveled to South Africa for treatment for injuries sustained in a bombing during a Mnangagwa campaign rally ahead of the July 30 vote. 

Since last year, Chiwenga's hands have been visibly swollen with discolored skin patches.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A former mayor campaigning on an anti-corruption ticket swept to victory in El Salvador's presidential election on Sunday, bringing an end to a two-party system that has held sway over the violence-plagued Central American country for three decades. 
Nayib Bukele, the 37-year-old former mayor of the capital, San Salvador, won 54 percent of votes with returns counted from 88 percent of polling stations, said Julio Olivo, the head of the electoral tribunal. 
Bukele won more votes than all other candidates combined in his first-round sweep, highlighting deep voter frustration over the failure of the two main parties to tackle violence and corruption.
""This day is historic for our country. This day El Salvador destroyed the two-party system,"" Bukele told hundreds of Salvadorans who danced, waved flags and blew whistles in a San Salvador plaza that Bukele revitalized when he was mayor from 2015 to 2018. 
His two rivals from the mainstream political parties conceded defeat.
Bukele must now contend with U.S. President Donald Trump's frequent threats to cut aid to El Salvador - as well as neighboring Guatemala and Honduras - if they do not do more to curb migration to the United States. 
At home, supporters hope that a third-party politician will usher in changes to improve a sluggish economy and widespread poverty. 
""Let's see if he can do what he's promised for us,"" said a jubilant supporter, Baltazar Sanchez, 30, at Bukele's victory speech. 
""After 30 years of two parties, we've been dealt the best hand."" 
'WE DID IT' 
Gang violence has made tiny El Salvador one of the world's most murderous countries in the past few years, driving Salvadorans to flee to the north. 
Among his campaign promises, Bukele, an avid social media user who snapped a selfie with supporters before declaring his win, said he would push infrastructure projects to limit such migration.
Since the end of its civil war in 1992, El Salvador has been governed by the ruling leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and its rival, conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA).
Though he describes himself as from the left and was expelled from the FMLN, Bukele has formed a coalition including a right-wing party that together has just 11 seats in the legislature, which consists of 84 people.
Outside the hotel in San Salvador where Bukele waited for the results, a group of supporters set off fireworks, beat drums and danced as early figures came in.
""Yes, we did it! Yes, we did it!"" they chanted. 
FMLN candidate Hugo Martinez conceded defeat shortly after Bukele's victory speech while ARENA candidate Carlos Calleja said he recognized the election results and would call Bukele to offer congratulations. 
Definitive results would be announced within two days, Olivo said.
'CORRUPT CAN'T HIDE'
Along with the goal of modernizing government, Bukele, who is set to take office in June, has proposed creating an international anti-corruption commission with the support of the United Nations, following similar committees in Guatemala and Honduras.
""We'll create a (commission) ... so that the corrupt can't hide where they always hide, instead they'll have to give back what they stole,"" Bukele said in January.
Growing up, Bukele's relatively wealthy family was sympathetic to the FMLN, the former leftist guerrilla army that became a political party at the end of the civil war.
But Bukele has turned away from Latin America's traditional left, branding Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega as well as conservative Honduran Juan Orlando Hernandez as dictators.

""A dictator is a dictator, on the 'right' or the 'left',"" Bukele wrote last week on Twitter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A major bloc of Latin American nations and Canada will discuss on Monday how to maintain pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to hold new elections as he faces widespread calls to resign after last year's disputed presidential vote.
Sources briefed on the matter said that the 14-nation Lima Group looked set, though, to hold off imposing further sanctions on the Maduro government when it meets in Ottawa.
Most group members say Maduro should quit in favour of opposition leader Juan Guaido - who declared himself interim president last month - and are calling for a new presidential election in the troubled OPEC nation.
The United States, which is not a member of the group, also wants Maduro gone.
""How can we continue to support the opposition to keep the pressure up on the regime and push for new elections? Certainly that's something we'll be looking at,"" said a Canadian government official.
Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse and the exodus of millions of Venezuelans, said in an interview that aired on Spanish television channel Antena 3 on Sunday: ""We don't accept ultimatums from anyone,"" adding: ""I refuse to call for elections now - there will be elections in 2024.""
Maduro, who has maintained the critical support of the military, has said Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him.
Monday's meeting in Ottawa will also discuss how to aid the people of Venezuela, including through immediate humanitarian assistance, said the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Last month, the Lima Group announced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials and a freeze on their foreign assets.
The Canadian source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, declined to comment when asked whether more punitive measures could be imposed.
Two sources briefed on the talks said such an announcement was unlikely for now.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last week issued sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA in a move likely to cut revenues for a country hit by medicine shortages and malnutrition.
Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, said military intervention in Venezuela was ""an option.""
Trudeau spoke on Sunday to Guaido and the two ""discussed the importance of the international community sending a clear message regarding the illegitimacy of the Maduro regime,"" Trudeau's office said.
The challenge for participants is that Mexico, a member of the Lima Group, opposes any measures to oust Maduro, who also has the backing of Russia, China and Turkey.
While European Union governments will soon move to recognise Guaido as interim president, members are set to use cautious language for fear of setting a precedent for political crises, said diplomatic sources.
That does not sit well with nations such as Columbia, which neighbours Venezuela.

""The most important issue now is to get Europe in line and to deepen the isolation of Venezuela and its backers,"" said a government official in Bogota, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Jailed Bahraini footballer Hakeem Al Araibi, who fled political upheaval in the Middle East nation and has refugee status in Australia, will spend at least two more months in prison in Thailand after a court set an extradition hearing for April.
The case has drawn appeals from Australia’s prime minister and soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, for Thailand to release Araibi and send him back to Australia, on the grounds that he could face torture in Bahrain, which sought the extradition.
Australian ambassador-designate to Thailand Allan McKinnon and diplomats from at least 13 countries greeted Araibi as he arrived at the courthouse in the Thai capital on Monday, wearing beige prison uniform, with shackles on his feet.
""Don't send me to Bahrain,"" said the footballer, who was arrested in Thailand in November while on his honeymoon and says that he faces persecution and torture if sent back to Bahrain.
The court gave the defense team until April 5 to submit documents opposing the extradition, and set April 22 for a preliminary hearing of witnesses and evidence, said defense lawyer Nadthasiri Bergman.
""We are not worried about the law because we have evidence to show that he should not be sent to Bahrain,"" Bergman told Reuters before Monday's hearing.
A Thai prosecutor submitted the Bahraini extradition request to the court last week, saying it showed Araibi had committed criminal wrongdoing and so should be extradited.
Supporters say that Araibi, as a recognized refugee, should be released and sent back to Australia instead.
""Thailand has really been used by Bahrain in this situation,"" said former Australian soccer captain Craig Foster, who has been campaigning around the world for Araibi's release, and was at the court..
""The Thai prime minister should simply step up and say this is a politically motivated charge, that the international reputation of Thailand is being damaged, and that Hakeem Al Araibi should immediately be released,"" Foster told Reuters.
Thailand's judiciary will decide the matter, the country's deputy foreign minister said.
""Even though he has refugee status from Australia, there is an official extradition request from Bahrain, which has to go through our judicial process,"" Virasakdi Futrakul told Reuters.
""We do not use political decision in this matter,"" he added. ""The government will not interfere with the judiciary.""
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and sport officials such as Fatma Samoura, the secretary-general of soccer's world governing body, FIFA, and Praful Patel, vice president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), have also urged Araibi's release.
Araibi, who fled Bahrain in 2014 before being granted permanent residence in Australia, where he played for Melbourne's Pascoe Vale soccer club, was arrested on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain's request.
Interpol later canceled the notice. 
Araibi was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, New York-based Human Rights Watch has said.
Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.
Araibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia. 

He denies wrongdoing, saying he was playing in a televised football match at the time of the alleged vandalism.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 11:38PM ET</span>",Five Abu Sayyaf members surrender over Philippine church bombing,"MANILA (Reuters) - A senior Abu Sayyaf operative and four members of the militant group believed to be behind the deadly bombing of a church in the southern Philippines surrendered to authorities over the weekend, the national police chief said on Monday.
Kammah Pae, whom authorities believe to have aided an Indonesian couple in the Jan 27 suicide attack, gave himself up to government troops, Oscar Albayalde said.
""He was forced to surrender,"" Albayalde told a media briefing. ""He probably didn't want to die during the military offensive."" 
Philippine troops killed three suspected Abu Sayyaf militants and suffered five fatalities in a firefight on Saturday in Patikul, a town in the province of Sulu as troops pursued those behind the church attack.
Albayalde said Kammah denied involvement in the twin bombings at the Jolo cathedral that killed 23 people, including civilians and soldiers, but eyewitnesses' accounts showed he escorted the Indonesian couple.
Security forces also retrieved an improvised explosive device (IED) and components from his home, Albayalde added. 
The five suspects will face multiple murder charges, among others, Albayalde said. 
However, the investigation into the church bombing in Sulu, a known stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf group, is ""far from over,"" he added.
Abu Sayyaf is a militant organization notorious for kidnappings and extremist factions and has pledged allegiance to Islamic State. 
""There are more pieces of evidence that need to carefully examined,"" Albayalde said. 
Before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte suggested on Tuesday that the twin explosions may have been a suicide attack, military and police said the bombs within and outside the church appeared to have been detonated remotely.
A few days later, Duterte's interior minister, Eduardo Ano, said that suicide attack was carried out by an Indonesian couple with the help of Abu Sayyaf.

That would be in line with a claim of responsibility by Islamic State via its Amaq news agency early on Monday.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday became the first pontiff to set foot on the Arabian Peninsula, just hours after issuing his strongest condemnation yet of the war in Yemen, where his host the United Arab Emirates has a leading military role.
Shortly before departing for Abu Dhabi, Pope Francis said he was following the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with great concern, using his regular Sunday address in Vatican City to urge all sides to implement a fragile peace deal and help deliver aid to millions of hungry people.
""The cry of these children and their parents rises up to God,"" he told tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ).
""Let us pray strongly because they are children who are hungry, who are thirsty, they don't have medicine and they are in danger of death,"" he said before boarding his flight.
The UAE welcomed the Pope's message on Yemen and believes the peace deal he referred to was a historic breakthrough, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter.
""Let us assure its implementation and make 2019 the year of peace in Yemen,"" he said after the pope landed in Abu Dhabi.
Yemen's warring parties agreed a ceasefire in December at the first major peace talks of the nearly four-year-old war, which pits Arab states backing an exiled president against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls the capital.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict, and the United Nations says millions are on the verge of starvation. Their survival depends on the truce preventing aid from being cut off by all-out fighting for the country's main port.
Francis was greeted by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who escorted him to meet Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Egypt's Al-Azhar mosque and university, one of the main seats of learning of Sunni Islam. The pontiff embraced him.
Both men will hold meetings with Pope Francis on Monday.
The UAE plays a leading role in the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in Yemen. The United Nations is trying to implement a truce and troop withdrawal deal in the main Yemeni port of Hodeidah, agreed at the December talks as a step that could pave the way for negotiations to end the conflict.
Vatican officials have said it is not clear whether Pope Francis will address the sensitive subject in public or private during his visit to Abu Dhabi, which is aimed at promoting interfaith dialogue.
""NEW PAGE""
The pope will meet Muslim leaders and celebrate an outdoor mass for some 135,000 Catholics, an event with no precedent on the Arabian peninsula. He has said the trip, which ends on Tuesday, is an opportunity to write ""a new page in the history of relations between religions"".
The UAE, which named 2019 its Year of Tolerance, says the visit reflects its history as a ""cradle of diversity"".
But it faces criticism from human rights groups for jailing activists, including Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati who is serving a 10-year sentence for criticizing the government on social media. 
""We are calling on Pope Francis to raise the issue of their incarceration with his hosts, and urge their immediate and unconditional release,"" Amnesty International said in a statement on Saturday. UAE authorities did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The UAE is home to around 1 million expatriate Catholics, many from the Philippines. Another 1 million Catholics are believed to live in other countries in the Arabian Peninsula.
Priests and diplomats describe the UAE as one of the least restrictive environments in the Gulf for Christian worship. But like its neighbors, the UAE does not allow dissent or criticism of its leadership.
All Gulf states except Saudi Arabia allow Christian worship in churches or church compounds and other premises with special licenses. In Saudi Arabia, non-Muslims pray in secret gatherings in private homes and embassies.
Abu Dhabi's crown prince is an ally of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has reached out to Christian representatives abroad as part of attempts to open up the conservative kingdom. Mohammed bin Salman's international reputation has eroded since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
The pope has already visited half a dozen predominantly Muslim nations during his reign, using the trips to call for inter-religious dialogue and to condemn the use of violence in the name of God. 
The UAE ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, wrote in an op-ed in Politico magazine on Sunday that the pontiff's visit sent a signal of co-existence and respect in the face of the ""menace of extremism"" across the Middle East.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>",Hong Kong's wild boar dilemma in the Chinese New Year of the Pig,"By Aleksander Solum
HONG KONG (Reuters) - One of the world's most densely populated cities, Hong Kong, is facing a proliferation of wild boars as the large mammals stray increasingly into built-up areas.
And while some residents welcome sightings of the boars as a symbol of good fortune, especially with the arrival of the Chinese Lunar Year of the Pig on Tuesday, others say reports of attacks show that the wild pigs are becoming a danger.
The global financial hub isn't well known for its biodiversity, but with 40 percent of its land area comprised of protected country parks and reserves, it still harbors creatures such as boar, barking deer, porcupine, otters, threatened pangolins, giant Burmese pythons and more than 530 species of bird, some highly endangered.
Continued urbanization of the city of 7.4 million is now increasingly drawing droves of wild boar to the teeming metropolis' fringes. Boar have charged down hikers, raided rubbish tips and camp sites, and even scampered through a shopping mall and a runway at the airport.
""Most Hong Kong wild boars, at this point, have already lost their fear of humans"", said Roni Wong, a member of a community group campaigning for the protection of wild boars.
""The cause of it is feeding, which causes them to lose their natural instincts"", added Wong who has identified numerous spots where residents feed wild animals in violation of local wildlife protection laws.
The habituation of boars to humans has brought some safety concerns. Complaints against wild pigs have more than doubled since 2013, with over 700 incidents reported in 2017, including some attacks on people.
""A lot of the residents who used to take part in outdoor leisure activities, especially at night, are no longer doing that"", said Jeremy Young, a district councillor for the Peak, an affluent area with a conspicuous boar population in its woods.
""They are scared. You don't want to run into a 250 pound (113 kilogram) male pig with tusks.""
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said in a statement to Reuters that some pigs ""pose imminent risks to public safety, particularly those which have attacked people, or are accustomed to searching for food around built-up areas and also getting easily irritated.""
Young believes the government should once again allow the selective culling of boars by ""civilian hunting teams"" to mitigate the porcine threat, a practice that was suspended in 2017 after an outcry by animal rights groups.
The AFCD, however, rejected this proposal.
Instead, it said it would take measures to put down, or relocate troublesome pigs to wilder areas, and to fit some with GPS trackers.
Authorities say they don't know the size of Hong Kong's wild pig population, nor whether numbers have actually increased or whether they're just venturing more frequently into urban areas. 
""Most Hongkongers won't mind the wild boars,"" said 40-year-old taxi driver Water Siu, shortly after a boar interrupted his Sunday barbecue in the Aberdeen country park.

""In fact, we see them as our neighbors.""

Self-governed Taiwan is China's most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory.
President Xi Jinping has stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, became president in 2016.
He kicked off 2019 with a speech warning that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, though it will strive for peaceful ""reunification"".
Taiwan is able to maintain cultural traditions and is committed to uphold the values of freedom and democracy, Tsai said in the message, posted late on Sunday on her official social media accounts.
""Those in places lacking democracy may not understand this commitment. We hope that ethnic Chinese all over the world can experience this blessing,"" she added, without directly mentioning China.
""So I want to make three new year's wishes for our ethnic Chinese friends both at home and abroad. I hope that you may all enjoy democracy, freedom and continued prosperity.""
There was no immediate reaction from Beijing. Xi's new year's speech, also on Sunday, did not mention Taiwan, apart from new year wishes to people on the island. 
Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections early next year. Tsai's party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.
Tsai has repeatedly called on China to respect Taiwan's democracy, and to embrace democratic reforms itself.

Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, where Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent since assuming office six years ago and the ruling Communist Party has tightened controls on all facets of society.

The Patriots had several promising drives and easily controlled the time of possession but costly errors kept them out of the end zone.

A couple and their young daughter from the town of Zeta in Montenegro, drowned in the boat accident, along with a man who tried to help them, Montenegrin media reported. Other people on the boat were rescued. 
Media said eight people had been on board the boat, including an Orthodox priest who was taking the group to visit an Orthodox monastery on the other side of the lake.
Higher temperatures after sub-zero temperatures last month and heavy rains have melted snow in most of the Western Balkans. About half a dozen rivers in Bosnia burst their banks on Sunday, causing flooding of hundreds of houses, damaging bridges and blocking roads.
Two towns in central Bosnia, Zenica and Kakanj, declared emergencies as streets in some neighborhoods turned into rivers and rescue services began evacuating people from houses in rubber boats. Schools in the most affected areas of central Bosnia announced they will be closed on Monday.

Erdogan has described Assad as a terrorist and said several times during Syria's eight-year conflict that the Syrian leader must go. But with support from Russia and Iran, Assad has recaptured large parts of Syria from rebel fighters, driving them from most of their former strongholds.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in December Turkey and other countries would consider working with Assad if he won a democratic election, and last month said Ankara was in indirect contact with Damascus via Russia and Iran.
Erdogan suggested on Sunday that Turkey also had direct contacts with the Syrian government.
""Foreign policy with Syria continues at a lower level,"" he told broadcaster TRT in an interview, adding that intelligence services operated differently to political leaders.
""Leaders may be cut out. But intelligence units can communicate for their interests,"" Erdogan said. ""Even if you have an enemy, you should not break the ties. You may need that later.""
The Turkish president also said that a proposed safe zone in northeastern Syria, which President Donald Trump has said should be established as U.S. forces withdraw from the area, could not be set up by Western coalition forces without Turkey.
""We can provide the security in the area. We can manage the region together with you,"" Erdogan said. ""No problem there. But we can't leave the region for coalition forces.""
Washington has said the proposed safe zone should address Turkish concerns about preventing any cross-border threat from Kurdish YPG militia fighters in north Syria, while also preventing Turkish military operations against the YPG.
Trump abruptly announced his intention in December to withdraw the 2,000-strong U.S. force from Syria, over the objections of top advisers including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who quit in protest. One of the main concerns of critics of Trump's decision is the fate of the YPG if U.S. forces leave. 
The group has been the main ally of U.S. forces battling Islamic State in Syria. Turkey, however, considers the YPG to be a terrorist group indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey since the 1980s.

Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for talks on Syria in the Russian resort of Sochi on Feb. 14.

ACRE, Israel (Reuters) - A prayer caller at a mosque in the Israeli city of Acre is appealing for his job back after being fired over photos posted online of him in a revealing outfit at a bodybuilding contest.
Ibrahim al-Masri said he lost his job as chief muezzin of the Al-Jazzar Mosque after local officials came upon the photos of him at the state bodybuilding championship in 2017.
""Each sport has a specific type of clothing. Football has its own, tennis has its own, swimming has its own. Same thing for bodybuilding,"" Masri said, referring to the wire-thin briefs competitors typically wear.
""I never dreamed this would happen. Because I know that Israel is a democratic country, and if someone makes a mistake, they can fix it,"" Masri said. ""But to fix a mistake with another mistake? It’s not right.""
Around 20 percent of Israeli citizens are Arab. Mosques and other non-Jewish religious institutions are supervised by local officials who report to the Interior Ministry.
A ministry spokesperson said that Masri ""was dismissed in accordance with all the rules"" but declined to give further details about the case. The mosque declined to comment and referred questions to the ministry.
Masri said the decision to fire him was taken by an official who viewed it ""as something incredibly disgraceful for a religious worker to go enter this competition"".

""When they made their decision, they only saw the uniform,"" he said. ""They didn’t see the person behind it.""
The 46-year-old's voice has become a staple of life in Acre, where Mediterranean waves crash into the walls of the old city. Five times a day he called Muslim faithful to prayer over loudspeakers atop the mosque minaret. He also helped encourage some younger members of the congregation to get off the streets and go to the gym.
""The people of Acre love him. He is our muezzin, with a beautiful voice, and a charitable person,"" said Refaat Sha-aban, 50, an Acre resident and former member of the city’s municipal council. ""He is an example to all of the young people in our city, and to the state of Israel itself.""

The men - Maxwell Joya, Carlos Quiceno and Julio Diaz - were taken hostage by the National Liberation Army (ELN) on Jan. 11, in the Hacari area of northeastern Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province. 
They appear to be in good health, the commissioner said in a statement.
The rebels said last month they had burned the helicopter and taken the nearly $550,000 in cash they found aboard. Local media reported the chartered helicopter was hired to securely transport the cash.
President Ivan Duque reactivated Interpol red notices, similar to an international arrest warrant, against ELN leaders after a car bombing in Bogota claimed by the group killed 21 police cadets in January.
Several of the group's top commanders are in Cuba, participating in long-stalled peace talks with the government to end more than five decades of fighting. 
The rebel leaders in Cuba have said they will not leave unless Duque complies with conditions agreed to by his predecessor for their return home in the case of a breakdown in talks.
Though the ELN claimed responsibility for the Bogota bombing in a statement, calling it a legitimate act of war, the negotiators said they had no prior knowledge of the attack. 
The 2,000-strong guerrilla group, founded in 1964, is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. 
The ELN is believed to be holding 14 more hostages. Duque has repeatedly said talks will not begin again until all captives are freed.
Cuba previously hosted negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, which demobilized in 2017 and is now a political party.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Authorities in Pakistan's Baluchistan province said on Sunday they had launched an investigation into the death of a regional leader of a Pakistani civil rights group, who died in what his movement called a ""targeted attack"" by police at a sit-in.
Arman Loni died on Saturday after police tried to break up a four-day demonstration in the city of Loralai by the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which stages demonstrations nationwide against violence and disappearances carried out by the state.
A police spokesman said Loni had died of a heart attack following clashes between protesters and police. But Mohsin Dawar, a member of parliament and founding member of PTM, said the police had singled Loni out and deliberately beat him to death because of his role as a leader of the group.
""It was a targeted attack on him by police, I think his neck was broken and this was confirmed in the postmortem,"" Dawar told Reuters, adding that he was killed for his ""association with PTM"".
The group, which was founded a year ago to protest against the death of a Pashtun man killed by police in the southern port of Karachi, regularly draws thousands of protesters to its demonstrations against state violence. It has called nationwide protests for Tuesday to highlight the killing of Loni.
The Baluchistan chief minister has ordered an inquiry into the killing. Both the Baluchistan home minister and information minister said they had no knowledge of how he died.
PTM blames the Pakistani military and other state organs for what it says are forced disappearances resulting in thousands of unresolved missing persons cases, primarily from the ethnic Pashtun region bordering Afghanistan.
Dawar and fellow lawmaker Ali Wazir, both PTM founders who were elected to parliament in July, were initially barred from entering Baluchistan by security officials and had to use ""alternate routes"" to make it to Loni's funeral, Dawar said.
A notification from the provincial home department reviewed by Reuters said Dawar and Wazir were barred from entering the province for 90 days in ""the best interest of peace and security"".
Provincial Home Minister Agha Umer Bangulzai confirmed that PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen had been barred from the province but said he knew nothing about movement restrictions on the two lawmakers Dawar and Wazir.
Last month Alamzeb Mehsud, another senior PTM leader, was arrested in Karachi, causing a social media outcry. He has been charged under anti-terrorism and public order laws. Supporters say he has been targeted for protesting against abuses by the military.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will consider extending the presidential term to six years from four, a senior lawmaker said on Sunday, which could allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power beyond 2022, when his second term is due to end.
The speaker of Egypt's parliament, Ali Abdelaal, said he had received a motion from lawmakers proposing constitutional amendments which will be considered by parliament after the motion is discussed in committee. He gave no details on the proposed changes.
But Abdel-Hadi al-Qassabi, head of the Support Egypt parliamentary bloc that is sponsoring the amendments, said the proposed changes included extending the presidential term.
""Looking to maintain stability and to complete the development plans, there is a proposal to extend the presidential term to six years,"" Qassabi told journalists in parliament before the motion was conveyed to Abdelaal. 
Speculation has been building that authorities would seek to change the current constitution, approved in a 2014 referendum, to allow Sisi to remain in office. 
It was not immediately clear if the proposed amendments would scrap the two-term limit stipulated in the current constitution or if that limit would be retained to apply to the longer new six-year presidency.
Constitutional changes could take months because they require approval by two thirds of parliament's 596 members followed by a referendum.
Parliament, which Abdelaal said would be allowed to debate any proposed changes, overwhelmingly supports Sisi.
The current constitution, approved by a referendum in 2014, allows the president and a fifth of parliament members to propose an amendment to any of the constitution's articles, said Qassabi.
The proposed changes also include adding a second, upper parliamentary chamber known as the Council of Senators as well as the appointment of one or more deputy presidents, he said.
Egypt had a second upper chamber known as the Shura Council, but it was abolished in 2014.
Other proposals include a quota guaranteeing women at least 25 percent of seats in parliament, as well as ""adequate representation"" for youth, farmers, workers and the country's Christian minority.
Egyptian state news agency MENA said in December that an Egyptian court had scheduled hearings of a petition by a number of ordinary Egyptians demanding that the speaker of parliament take steps to introduce constitutional changes that would allow Sisi to seek re-election after his second term in office expires.

The petitioners argue that article 140 of the constitution, which sets the term limits, is ""unfair to the great Egyptian people"" and that eight years gives a president too little time to deal with the economic and security challenges facing the country.

GAZA (Reuters) - Egypt will hold talks with leaders of two major Palestinian factions to try to salvage faltering unity efforts and to restore calm with Israel, officials said on Sunday.
The head of the Islamist militant group Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, led a delegation to meet with Egyptian security officials in Cairo. The leader of a smaller Gaza-based faction, Islamic Jihad, also headed to Cairo, Palestinian officials said.
Hamas has been in a bitter rivalry with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the occupied West Bank, for more than a decade. Numerous reconciliation efforts have failed.
Egypt is also trying to prevent an escalation in violence between Hamas and Israel, after months of tension along the Israel-Gaza border. Cairo sent officials to Gaza in recent weeks to keep an eye on the situation.
""Cairo is driven by its interest to avoid a new war in Gaza and in improving the living conditions of Gaza residents,"" said one Palestinian official, who asked not to be named.
Relations between Hamas and Abbas' Palestinian Authority (PA) worsened last month when Abbas ordered his men to leave their posts at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the main corridor for Gazans.
This prompted Cairo, which had in the past year coordinated operations with the PA, to close the crossing.
Gaza officials now say that Egypt has quietly resumed operations at the Rafah crossing over the past week, this time working with Hamas. However, there was no immediate comment on the reopening of Rafah from Egyptian officials.
On Sunday, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh passed through the Rafah crossing, along with dozens of other Palestinians.
Two million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, where poverty is rampant and unemployment stands at 50 percent. Israel, together with Egypt, maintains a blockade of the enclave, citing security concerns. 
Gaza's health ministry says more than 220 Palestinians have been killed in the past year by Israeli troops in weekly protests along the border, billed as pressing for an end to the blockade.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>",UK PM May will seek 'pragmatic' solution to Brexit deal in Brussels,"By Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would seek a ""pragmatic solution"" to a parliamentary impasse over the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union when she tries to reopen talks with Brussels.
With less than two months until Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29, concerns are growing over the risk of a disorderly 'no deal' exit.
Japanese carmaker Nissan canceled plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain, saying while it had taken the decision for business reasons the continued uncertainty around Britain's future EU ties was ""not helping companies like ours to plan for the future."" 
The issue that has brought most opposition from lawmakers in her Conservative Party is the post-Brexit border between the United Kingdom and Ireland, but May, writing in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, shed little light on how she intended to resolve it.
Members of parliament, who last month rejected May's Brexit deal with the EU, have instructed her to return to Brussels to renegotiate the arrangements for Northern Ireland.
The EU has rejected reopening talks on the so-called 'backstop', an insurance policy to keep an open border on the island of Ireland if Britain and the EU fail to reach a longer-term trade agreement before the end of a transition period.
""MPs said that, with changes to the Northern Ireland backstop, they would support the deal that I agreed with Brussels to take us out of the EU,"" May wrote.
""When I return to Brussels I will be battling for Britain and Northern Ireland, I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for.""
But prominent eurosceptic Conservative Steve Baker said many pro-Brexit lawmakers had broader concerns about her deal.
""Now the PM co-opts us into accepting everything but the backstop,"" he said on Twitter, adding if all that was agreed on the backstop was a codicil, May could ""expect a further substantial defeat for the agreement.""
Pro-Brexit trade minister Liam Fox said it would be ""irresponsible"" for the EU to refuse to reopen the Brexit negotiations.
""Are they really saying that they would rather not negotiate and end up in a 'no-deal' position?"" Fox told Sky News. ""It is in all our interests to get to that agreement and for the EU to say we are not going to even discuss it seems to me to be quite irresponsible.""
Fox echoed comments by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday that a delay to the March 29 leaving date may be needed in order to get legislation through parliament.
LAST THING THE COUNTRY NEEDS
May's office denied a report in two Sunday newspapers that her advisors were considering a June election. The Mail said the plan would be to delay Brexit but win parliament's backing for a deal in April and then renew May's mandate ahead of negotiations on Britain's future relationship with the EU.
May called an election at short notice in 2017 at which she lost her party's majority, leaving her reliant on a small Northern Irish party to govern.
""The last thing this country needs is a general election, I think the people would never forgive us for it, I think what they want is this parliament to deliver Brexit in an orderly way,"" interior minister Sajid Javid told BBC TV. 
The opposition Labour Party has said May needs to seek a customs union with the EU to win the support of its lawmakers, something opposed by many in her Conservative Party.
Javid said: ""You can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology, it is perfectly possible. The only thing that is missing is a bit of goodwill on the EU side.""
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney wrote in the Sunday Times: ""The backstop is a necessary guarantee, based on legal certainty, not just wishful thinking.""

""There is a deal on the table, and walking away from it will have serious consequences for us all.""

Trump is popular in Israel because of his tough policies toward the Palestinians and Iran and his transfer last May of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he recognized as Israel's capital in a break from long-standing U.S. policy. 
""Netanyahu. In another league,"" read the Hebrew-language billboard, in a swipe at the caliber of the veteran prime minister's opponents in the April 9 national election.
A spokesman for Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, whose logo adorns the sign over Tel Aviv's busy Ayalon highway, did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on whether the White House had authorized it to use the photograph.
Netanyahu is favorite to win the election but opinion polls show one of his toughest challengers, former general Benny Gantz, making gains.
The prime minister is facing possible charges in three graft cases. He denies any wrongdoing and has called the investigations a witch-hunt.
On Friday, Israel's attorney general said there was no legal reason to prevent him from announcing, before the election, any intention to indict Netanyahu on corruption charges should he decide such a move was warranted.

Formal indictment in court would depend on pre-trial hearings, likely to be held only after the poll.

A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, which is fighting a last Islamic State pocket east of the Euphrates, said its local allies had been fired on and ""exercised their right to self defense"", adding that the incident was under investigation. 
""U.S. coalition aircraft launched an aggression this evening against one of the Syrian Arab army formations operating in the Albukamal area in the southeastern countryside of Deir al-Zor,"" Syrian state news agency SANA cited the military source as saying early on Sunday. 
The attack injured two soldiers and destroyed an artillery piece, the source added. 
Coalition spokesman Col. Sean Ryan said in an email: ""Our partner forces were fired upon and exercised their inherent right to self defense.""
The coalition is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a collection of Syrian militias spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG. 
Islamic State now holds only a couple of villages in Syria, having lost almost all its territory in 2017 to two rival offensives, one by the SDF, and one by the Syrian army and allied militia backed by Russia. 
The jihadist group also holds an enclave of desert surrounded by the Syrian army in the center of the country. 
Its territory on the Euphrates was ""down to the last two villages"", Ryan said, adding that the coalition expected these to ""clear soon"", and that Islamic State's remaining fighters there were mostly foreigners. 
Russia and the United States maintained military communications to prevent unplanned conflict between the two forces fighting Islamic State. However, some clashes have occurred.

Turkey has backed Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in contrast with NATO allies the United States and Canada, and several right-leaning Latin American countries which have recognized Guaido's move to declare himself interim leader.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, who has strengthened economic and political ties with Caracas, called Maduro last month to urge him to stand tall against what he described as ""anti-democratic developments"".
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday the countries which were supporting Guaido should instead have worked for negotiations to resolve Venezuela's crisis. 
""There is a problem in a country, there is a spark that can turn into a fire at any moment. In this case, they should have contributed to the solution of the problem through dialogue,"" Cavusoglu told reporters in Istanbul.
""But is that how they handled things? No. On the contrary, the event was fueled from the outside. The people of Venezuela are being punished by such approach,"" he said.
Cavusoglu said Turkey had tried to initiate talks on Venezuela last year between Washington and Latin American countries. ""But today, none of the countries that have taken these steps against Venezuela has sought dialogue."" 
Disagreement over Venezuela could become another serious point of friction between Washington and Ankara, which are also divided over policy in Syria, Iran sanctions and Turkey's plans to buy Russian missile defense system.
On Friday Marshall Billingslea, U.S. assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the Treasury, held talks with Turkish officials about sanctions on Venezuela and Iran.
A senior U.S. official said last week Washington was looking at Turkey's commercial activities with Venezuela and would take action ""if we assess a violation of our sanctions"".
Turkish officials say Ankara's trade is in accordance with international laws and regulations.
In his remarks on Sunday Cavusoglu also reiterated Turkish criticism of what Ankara sees as a weak international response to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul four months ago.
""Recently Western countries - you know they are very sensitive about human rights, trying to teach everyone about human rights - are silent,"" he said suggesting they were more interested in protecting commercial ties with Riyadh.

""They are making deals and selling arms,"" Cavusoglu said.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 06:37AM ET</span>",Yemen's warring parties meet on ship to discuss stalled troop withdrawal,"DUBAI/ADEN (Reuters) - Representatives from both sides in the Yemen conflict met on a ship on the Red Sea on Sunday in a U.N.-led push to implement a stalled troop withdrawal from Yemen's main port of Hodeidah as agreed at December peace talks, a U.N. official told Reuters.
The United Nations is overseeing the implementation of a ceasefire and troop withdrawal accord in Hodeidah, the main entry point for most of Yemen's imports, in the hope it will lead to a political solution to the almost four-year war.
The warring parties were meant to withdraw their forces by Jan. 7 as part of efforts to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, but have failed to do so as the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and the Saudi-backed government disagree on who should control the city and ports. 
Sunday's meeting was the third time the U.N.-led Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) convened since it was formed in December, bringing together the Houthis with the Saudi-backed, internationally recognized Yemeni government and U.N. mediators.
The parties met on a U.N. ship because attempts to convene the third meeting in territory held by coalition forces failed because the Houthis were unwilling to cross the frontline, sources have told Reuters. The first two meetings were held in territory under Houthi control, after which the head of the U.N. mission tasked with overseeing the deal, Patrick Cammaert, shuttled between the two parties.
The vessel picked up a delegation from Yemen's internationally recognized government at an offshore meeting point in the Red Sea before sailing to Hodeidah to pick up the Houthi delegation, a U.N. statement said on Saturday.
The spokesman for the Yemeni government's delegation to the RCC, Sadiq Dweid, told Reuters the committee had discussed Cammaert's proposals for the troop withdrawal at Sunday's meeting.
""The meetings will continue,"" he said. 
The truce has largely held in Hodeidah, but clashes have increased in recent weeks and the U.N. Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths has urged all parties to reduce tensions. Violence has continued in other parts of the country not subject to the deal.
Griffiths' office told Reuters the meeting had begun on Sunday. 
The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been bogged down in military stalemate for years.
A Sunni Muslim Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after it was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014.
The Houthis, who say they are enacting a revolution against corruption, control most urban centers in the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation while Hadi's government controls the southern port of Aden and string of coastal towns.

Pope Francis said on Sunday he is following the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with great worry and urged all sides to respect international agreements and ensure food reaches suffering Yemenis.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2019 06:16AM ET</span>",Inside a raid in Maduro's crackdown on critics in Venezuela slums,"By Angus Berwick
CARACAS (Reuters) - After Venezuelan police officers clad in black military uniforms and masks stopped 27-year-old Yohendry Fernandez at gunpoint in the Caracas slum of Jose Felix Ribas, they asked him if he had a criminal record. He replied yes.
The officers then dragged him into an alley and shot him twice in the chest, killing him, according to his family and a witness.
It was the afternoon of Jan. 24, the day after tens of thousands of slum residents left their hillside homes to join mass protests against President Nicolas Maduro, who they blame for an economic crisis that has left them without water, power, medicines and food.
Several dozen officers from the National Police's Special Action Force (FAES) drove into the slum in armored vehicles and on motorcycles.
As they roared down the dusty streets, some opened fire as residents fled before them shouting ""They're here,"" according to witnesses. Police snipers clambered atop tin rooftops and locals hid under beds as the gunshots rang out, the witnesses said.
By dawn, the FAES unit had killed as many as 10 people, leaving with their bodies and about a dozen hooded detainees, according to four local community leaders.
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles all media inquiries, including on behalf of the national police, did not respond to requests for comment on the operation. Diosdado Cabello, the ruling Socialist Party's deputy head, accused the opposition of fabricating death tolls from police raids.
The FAES said reports of abuses were ""fake news"" spread by right-wing opponents. ""Our struggle is against all criminals that ravage our communities. If you fear the FAES it's because you're a criminal,"" the unit said on Thursday on Instagram.
Residents said the FAES officers returned to Jose Felix Ribas for the next three afternoons, spreading terror in a poor community that used to be a bastion of support for Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. Five years of economic recession have turned many into Maduro's most fervent opponents.
The raids, the deadliest of several in Caracas last month, show how the government has used the FAES to target critics since opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president and won the support of Western powers who say Maduro is illegitimate.
Reuters spoke with a dozen witnesses, local politicians, and lawyers, along with experts who study the FAES, to provide the first detailed look at the operation. Reuters also pieced together footage of the raid posted on social media, which witnesses verified.

FEAR THE FAES
The reporting reveals a pattern of street justice employed by FAES, set up in 2017 as an elite force to combat terrorism and organized crime, and an atmosphere of impunity. (For a Factbox on the FAES, click:)
The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a local crime monitoring group, attributes 43 deaths to security forces during protests and raids since Jan. 22, and says it is processing reports of more.
Keymer Avila, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, said he had not yet verified all the deaths in Jose Felix Ribas but that 10 seemed reasonable based on his understanding of the events. 
Rights groups accuse the government of using the FAES to raid Venezuelans' homes after they return from protests, with the help of tip-offs from supporters. Authorities have arrested more than 900 protesters since Jan. 21, the rights groups say.
Jose Pinto, head of the Revolutionary Tupamaro Movement, a militant group that backs Maduro, told Reuters he and other so-called ""colectivos"" were expanding their networks of informants.
They alerted police to ""suspicious activity"" before the Jan. 23 protests, Pino said, sending them images and addresses of suspected ""right-wing conspirators,"" which he said led to raids.
""CONSEQUENCES""
On Jan. 22, according to residents, an unmarked pickup truck mounted with speakers drove through Jose Felix Ribas, a district within Caracas' sprawling Petare shantytown, broadcasting a message: ""If you protest tomorrow, there will be consequences.""
Most said they took little heed. But six locals said the consequences became clear on Jan. 24 when FAES officers pulled a 23-year-old mother, the cousin of an alleged gang leader, from her house and shot her dead. A church was sprayed with bullets. One man was executed after being handcuffed inside a vehicle, residents said.
Local politicians said authorities justified the raid as an operation against a criminal group. The government has yet to show any evidence against those killed.
Paula Navas, a local political organizer, said the authorities sought to silence her community.
""They traumatized children. What was the objective of this?"" Navas asked. 
Yohendry Fernandez had been fixing motorcycles in a parking lot on the slum's main road, some 200 meters (yards) from his family home. 
Motorcycles were his obsession, relatives said, and videos on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page show him racing down Caracas avenues performing wheelies. He sometimes repaired motorcycles for the local police, they said.
At 3 p.m., just as Fernandez was about to head home, FAES officers arrived and split into groups that advanced into the barrio's upper reaches. One group set up a blockade on a plaza where the road divided. Fernandez's home, where his wife and two children were waiting, was on the other side.
""DON'T HURT HIM""
After family members told his mother, Isabel Pino, that he had been arrested at the plaza, she raced to the scene and begged an officer: ""Please don't hurt him, he's special.""
The officer ordered her to go back inside, Pino, 49, told Reuters. Then, she said, she heard two shots. 
The next time Pino saw her son was when she viewed his body at the hospital, a gunshot wound to his heart and another in his sternum. She said she has received no official explanation for his death, and that all his personal belongings were taken.
The family buried Fernandez last week at a cemetery outside the city, the only place they could afford. She says she tells his 4-year-old son, Andres, that his father is asleep.
Fernandez's wife, Wendys, along with Navas and Aviud Morales, a local teacher, confirmed the details of his death.
When FAES officers returned to Jose Felix Ribas in the days after the raid, they questioned the family about alleged criminal connections, which Pino denied. A night-time curfew was imposed across the whole sector.

""Just to hear the name, FAES, leaves me terrified. I was just told they are back around here and I can feel the pain in my stomach,"" Pino said, her voice shaking.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is seeking changes to the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with Brussels last year in order to win the support of parliament. The EU has said the deal cannot be renegotiated.
""Are they really saying that they would rather not negotiate and end up in a 'no-deal' position?"" Fox told Sky News in a pre-recorded interview. ""It is in all our interests to get to that agreement and for the EU to say we are not going to even discuss it seems to me to be quite irresponsible.""
With less than two months until Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, the opposition Labour Party has said it is now inevitable that the government will have to request an extension to the Article 50 exit negotiation period.
Fox, who has previously spoken out strongly against delaying the exit date, said extending the negotiations without a deal in place would not solve anything, but it was ""a very different argument"" if Britain just needed more time to get the necessary legislation in place for a smooth exit.
He is the second senior minister to suggest such a delay may be needed, after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday Britain may need time to get legislation through.
""There is a big difference between if we had an agreement and we need some time to get the legalities done, that is one thing,"" Fox said. ""I think to extend simply because we hadn’t reached an agreement would not provide any impetus for that agreement to be reached.""

Fox said Britain would ""be able to deal"" with leaving the bloc without an agreement but it would not be in the country's interests.

SEOUL (Reuters) - It was created as a biting satire of South Korea's notoriously competitive education system, but the country's most popular cable TV drama has inspired some fans to ignore its warnings and instead double down on their pursuit of success.
""SKY Castle"" follows several ambitious families as their drive to send their children to the country’s best universities and secure lucrative jobs leads to identity fraud, suicide and murder.
The show's name comes from a fictionalized version of luxury residential community in Seoul's suburbs, but is also a nod to the acronym ""SKY,"" which refers to South Korea's top three universities: Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University.
It’s the most-watched drama ever to air on South Korean cable networks, according to Nielsen Korea, and has found a wide following in China.
As the series came to an end this week, however, there were signs the show has led some South Koreans adopt some of the more intense educational measures the creators intended to criticize.
Sales of the ""studycube"", a 2.5 million won ($2,235) wooden closet less than one square meter in size where students can hide themselves away to focus on their homework, for example, have soared eight-fold after it was featured in the show, according to the company which makes it.
""I saw the studycube on 'SKY Castle' and bought it of my own will to create a suitable studying environment for me,"" said 16-year-old Lee Do-gyeong, who is hoping to be accepted to one of Seoul's top veterinary medicine programs.
Demand for specialized university entrance coaches has also increased, after the show depicted a university admissions coordinator going beyond school records to guide everything from sleeping patterns to friendships.
Lee Man-ki, director of Uway Institute of Educational Evolution, plans to increase the number of courses for aspiring college prep consultants by 50 percent. 
All of this runs contrary to what the show's creators intended, ""SKY Castle"" chief producer Kim Ji-youn told Reuters. 
""This news of a flood of orders for studycube or people eagerly searching for study coordinators are what the script writer wanted to avoid the most,"" she said.
""The script writer, who also went through her child's university admissions process, wanted to give the audience awareness of excessive education fever.""
READING IN THE TOILET
Studycubes sparked debate when they first appeared in South Korea seven years ago, and their appearance in ""SKY Castle"" led to fresh questions over the country's high-pressure education culture.
Lee Do-gyeong, the high school student, said she was looking forward to studying in cube's sound-proof seclusion, but she acknowledged that if parents forced their children to use the room it could be ""nothing more than a rice chest,"" a reference to an infamous incident where an 18th Century Korean prince was locked away in a rice chest to die.
Choi Ki-ju, the chief executive officer of studycube maker EMOK, said seclusion can help students focus without distractions.
One customer compared using the studycube to reading in the toilet, Choi said.
""This is simply accurate, don't we concentrate better when we read books in the toilet?"" he said.
""LIFE WILL GET EASIER""
The sense of competition in South Korea has only intensified amid one of the worst job slumps in years.
The 97,000 jobs added in 2018 was less than one-third the number created the year before, and marks the worst performance since 2009, according to data from Statistics Korea.
""As there are fewer jobs, intensifying competition to secure those seems to be appearing in the college prep process,"" said Kim Jung-woo, an economist at the Korea Labor Institute.
""The widespread perception among Korean society that people can work only if they graduate university is the fundamental cause of this excessive education fever."" 
On top of high school classes that run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., many children in South Korea stay at school for hours of self-learning everyday. Some take classes in private academies called ""hagwon"" until late at night, including weekends and even holidays, in a bid to get into the best schools and universities.
According to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 23 percent of South Korean students reported studying more than 60 hours per week, nearly double the OECD average of 13 percent.
South Korea’s expenditure on educational institutions is around 5.8 percent of the country’s GDP, one of the highest among OECD countries, and nearly half of tertiary education expenditure is funded by households, compared with an OECD average of 22 percent, the report added.
Three-quarters of students said they expect to complete university education, above the OECD average of 44 percent.
South Korea's education ministry in late January announced a plan to promote employment of high school graduates, saying the prevailing perception of university enrolment as the only way to success has created excessive competition and an overheated private education industry.
The ministry wants to reach a 60 percent employment rate of vocational high school students by 2022, aiming to reduce unemployment of college graduates as well as labor shortages in smaller businesses that university graduates turn their noses up at. 
Pressure at school and worries about jobs are seen as major contributors to South Korea's high youth suicide rate.
According to Statistics Korea, 31 percent of total deaths of children aged 10-19 are from suicide, the biggest cause of death among the age group.
The Institute for Social Development Studies' Research has reported that 40 percent of South Korean high school students who were particularly concerned with their grades have experienced suicidal impulses, while the country's children and teenagers' life satisfaction is the lowest among the OECD. 
Still, for many seeking a better life in South Korea's cutthroat economy, the top universities are still seen as the best bet.
""Even though (""SKY Castle"") may be extreme, it is still worth it to enter the top universities,"" said Kwon Seung-ok, a mother who said the show inspired her to hire a university consultant for her daughter ahead of entrance exams this year.
""That will lead to better opportunities and better employment. Life will definitely get easier.""

400,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2019 08:26PM ET</span>","Inmates shiver in frigid cells at New York jail, lawmakers say","By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inmates at a federal jail in Brooklyn have suffered for days without heat or power during a wintry cold snap, according to lawyers and U.S. lawmakers who rallied outside the jail on Saturday demanding the problems be fixed and ill inmates moved.
A fire last Sunday at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center cut off power and heat to parts of the jail just as freezing Arctic air began rolling towards the East Coast, according to motions filed this week in federal court by lawyers from the Federal Defenders who represent some of the inmates.
Since then, at least some of the more than 1,600 men and women incarcerated at the jail have suffered in near-freezing temperatures and in darkness after the sun goes down while locked in their cells for 23 hours a day, according to the court filings. On Wednesday night, the temperature in New York City dropped to nearly 0 Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius.)
""Inmates were wrapped head to toe in towels and blankets,"" Deirdre von Dornum, who oversees the Federal Defenders' Brooklyn team, said in a telephone interview on Saturday, recounting her tour of the jail the day before. ""Their windows were frosted over. Even more disturbingly perhaps for the inmates, their cells were pitch black and they don't have flashlights.""
She said senior officials at the jail were ""indifferent"" to the problems during her tour even as guards complained to her of the cold. The power problems have also meant inmates cannot easily call family or lawyers nor get any needed medication refilled, lawyers said.
Telephone calls to the jail went unanswered on Saturday, but it said in a statement that power had been affected in one building and that repair work should be completed on Monday. Additional blankets, provided by New York City's government, and clothing were to be given to inmates on Saturday, the statement said. A notice on the jail's website said all visits have been suspended until further notice.
Officials at the jail and the Bureau of Prisons had said in emails this week to the New York Times, which first reported the problems on Friday, that the cells still had heat and hot water.
One inmate, Dino Sanchez, has only a short-sleeved jumpsuit, a T-shirt and a single standard-issue thin blanket to keep him warm, according to a court filing by his attorney. Sanchez has asthma, which the cold has exacerbated, and fears collapsing in the dark without anyone noticing and coming to his aid, his lawyer wrote.
Nydia Velazquez, who represents parts of New York City in the U.S. House of Representatives, was one of the lawmakers who visited the jail on Saturday. She said the Bureau of Prisons was disregarding inmates' rights.
""This appalling situation needs to be fixed,"" she wrote on Twitter. She noted that some heat had been restored, but that the heating system was still ""not at fully capacity"" and that staff at the jail were still complaining about the cold on Saturday.
Hugh Hurwitz, the Bureau of Prisons' acting director, told lawmakers in telephone conversations he agreed that conditions in the jail were ""unacceptable"", according to Velazquez.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a brief statement that the conditions at the jail were unconstitutional and demanded an immediate fix.

Judge Analisa Torres ordered the Bureau of Prisons to produce witnesses at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday to explain how the complaints raised by inmates' lawyers were being addressed.

""These emergency evacuation plans have been in existence since the Cold War, but have now been repurposed in the event of civil disorder following a no-deal Brexit,"" the Sunday Times said, quoting an unnamed source from the government's Cabinet Office, which handles sensitive administrative issues.
The Mail on Sunday also said it had learnt of plans to move the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth, to safe locations away from London.
Britain's government is struggling to get parliamentary support for a Brexit transition agreement with the EU before the departure date of March 29, and the government and businesses are preparing contingency plans for a 'no-deal' Brexit.
Business groups have warned of widespread disruption if there are lengthy delays to EU imports due to new customs checks, and even possible shortages of food and medicine.
Last month an annual speech by the 92-year-old queen to a local women's group was widely interpreted in Britain as a call for politicians to reach agreement over Brexit.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker and keen supporter of Brexit, told the Mail on Sunday he believed the plans showed unnecessary panic by officials over a no-deal Brexit, as senior royals had remained in London during World War Two bombing.
But the Sunday Times said an ex-police officer formerly in charge of royal protection, Dai Davies, expected Queen Elizabeth would be moved out of London if there was unrest.

""If there were problems in London, clearly you would remove the royal family away from those key sites,"" Davies was quoted as saying.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian government announced on Sunday that there will soon be no children held in its immigration detention camps on the Pacific island of Nauru.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement that the final four asylum-seeker children in the Australian-run camps on Nauru had all had their claims to be resettled in the United States processed.
""Every asylum-seeker child has now been removed from Nauru or has had their claim processed and has a clear path off the island,"" Morrison said, in a joint statement with Immigration Minister David Coleman.
Under Australia's hardline immigration policy, asylum seekers who are intercepted at sea trying to reach the country are sent to camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. The rules state that they cannot be resettled in Australia, even if they are found to be refugees, and they are detained until they are accepted by another nation or agree to return home.
Australia has stopped publishing data on the number of refugees held in the centers. Local media and refugee advocates estimate close to 1,000 people are currently held.
The camps have been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.

The man, known by his nom de guerre Rodrigo Cadete, was a top member of a faction of former rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who refused to adhere to the peace agreement.
""Today in a seamless operation the criminal known as Rodrigo Cadete, one of the most feared figures of terrorism in our country, was neutralized,"" Duque said at an event in the city of Manizales.
Defense Minister Guillermo Botero said at the same event that Cadete had been bringing together dissidents to form a new group and that nine other guerrilla fighters were killed and others captured.
The dissidents have an estimated 1,800 combatants spread across about 30 units. 
Some 13,000 FARC members, including 6,000 combatants, demobilized under the peace accord. The group is now a political party, with 10 seats in Congress guaranteed through 2026.
The FARC fought the government for more than five decades. The conflict in Colombia has killed more than 260,000 people.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",Top German conservative hints at slower coal phase-out in nod to party right,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's phasing out of coal-fired power stations could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline creates problems for the security of electricity supply, a senior legislator in Chancellor Angela Merkel's party said.
The phase-out, proposed last Saturday by a commission tasked with mapping out Germany's transition to a more environmentally friendly low-carbon economy, drew criticism from some in industry who fear the impact of higher energy prices.
But in remarks that appeared aimed at the right of a party not always comfortable with Merkel's centrist approach, Ralph Brinkhaus, chair of the conservative benches in parliament, said it was crucial not to be ""dogmatic"" in pursuing a goal that was widely accepted.
""Energy supply security must be guaranteed,"" he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. ""If it is endangered, we should be free to do another round and address that, without abandoning the path we've chosen. There's no reason to be dogmatic about this.""
Brinkhaus, from the Christian Democrats' (CDU) most pro-business wing, last year toppled a Merkel ally in the race for the influential parliamentary leader post, precipitating the sequence of events that led to Merkel resigning as party leader and announcing that this would be her last term as chancellor.
That sparked a fight for the soul of the party, whose members have chafed at the centrist course that Merkel plotted over the 14 years of her chancellorship, during which time she has often seemed closer to leftists and Greens than some in her own party.
While her ally Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's narrow victory in the race to succeed her as party leader was seen as a win for her centrist vision, Brinkhaus's remarks are a reminder that the party's right has not gone away as the CDU gears up for a series of tough European and regional elections.
The coal commission unveiled its hard-won compromise after marathon talks early last Saturday, proposing to shut 12.7 GW of coal capacity by 2020 and promised 40 billion euros to help regions affected by the end of coal mining.
Brinkhaus also called in the interview for a rethink on government spending. ""Do we have too many regulations or even a nanny state?"" he asked.

An INSA poll for Bild newspaper on Saturday showed that the CDU is still by far the most popular party on 30 percent. But a disappointing election year could yet re-open the internal party war.

May, writing in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, shed little light on how she intended to solve the issue that has provoked most opposition from her lawmakers, post-Brexit arrangements for the border between the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Last month May suffered a record parliament defeat over her Brexit plans, and on Tuesday lawmakers instructed her to return to Brussels to renegotiate arrangements for Northern Ireland.
Lawmakers ""would ... be happy with the current backstop if there was a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism,"" May wrote. 
However, Ireland and EU negotiators have rejected any time-limit on the so-called 'backstop' -- a set of fall-back plans that would retain an open UK-Ireland border if Britain and the EU fail to reach a longer-term trade agreement in future talks.
Brexit supporters fear an unlimited backstop would effectively give the EU a veto on future British trade arrangements with other countries, and weaken economic ties between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
May is expected to visit Brussels in the coming days.
""When I return to Brussels I will be battling for Britain and Northern Ireland, I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for,"" May said.

Separately, May's office rejected a report in the Mail on Sunday newspaper that her advisors were considering an early election on June 6 if she got a Brexit deal through parliament.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale needs to change its behavior, cooperate more with authorities and be more transparent after a deadly dam collapse at one of its mines that likely killed more than 300 people, Brazil's solicitor general said on Saturday.
Speaking with reporters in the town of Brumadinho, near Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine that collapsed late last month, André Mendonça added that Vale's actions had not improved since another deadly tailings dam collapse in 2015, the Samarco project that it joint-owned with BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB).
""Firstly, we need a change of behavior. There has been a behavior of resistance to complying with obligations and we need effective cooperation, not only in words, but in gestures, in acts, that demonstrate responsibility for what happened,"" said Mendonça. 
""We need to have an effective assumption by Vale of its responsibility for the event ... So, we expect effective, quick responses from Vale regarding the disaster.""
In a later statement, the solicitor general's office said all of the costs associated with tragedy incurred by the federal government would be charged to Vale.
With 121 people confirmed dead and another 226 still missing, according to the latest tally on Saturday, the Brumadinho dam burst could be Brazil's deadliest mine disaster. 
The disaster poses a headache for the new government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whose new business-friendly administration must juggle public anger over the tragedy and its own desire to ease mining and environmental regulations to kick-start growth.
Hildebrando Neto, Minas Gerais' deputy minister for environmental regulations, told Reuters that all evidence suggests the burst was caused by liquefaction, whereby a solid material such as sand loses strength and stiffness and behaves more like a liquid.
Neto said liquefaction caused the 2015 collapse of the Samarco dam, which led to the deaths of 19 people.
Major Brazilian TV outlets obtained dramatic security camera video showing the outer wall of the dam collapsing and an avalanche of mud crushing trees, houses and cars in its path. Closeups replayed throughout the day showed cars and people scrambling unsuccessfully to escape the torrent.
Mendonça highlighted concern that Vale is not complying with obligations applied after the Samarco tragedy. He said compensation payments, as well as greater transparency and judicial compliance, have not been met.
In a statement, Vale said it had been cooperating with authorities, and ""providing all support to the population and the families of those affected."" 

Asked if members of Vale's executive board could be arrested, Mendonça said ""no hypothesis can be ruled out.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - An ally of Jair Bolsonaro won a fraught vote for the head of Brazil's Senate on Saturday, a boost for the far-right president's legislative efforts to open the economy, tackle crime and enact socially conservative measures.
Davi Alcolumbre, from the Democratas party, was supported by the president's son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, and Bolsonaro's Chief of Staff, Onyx Lorenzoni. He won 42 votes, one more than was needed to become Senate president.
His election comes the day after Rodrigo Maia, also of the Democratas party, won his bid to remain leader of the lower house.
Their victories should help Bolsonaro as he seeks to pass a divisive pension reform, which is widely seen as necessary to shore up Brazil's creaking public finances but is likely to face stiff opposition. 
The leaders of Brazil's legislative bodies have broad powers to pick and choose what bills are debated, and when. With two business-friendly legislature heads, Bolsonaro's pension reform bill stands a better chance.
However, the manner of Alcolumbre's win may herald trouble.
He beat Senator Renan Calheiros, a canny political operative who was seeking his fifth Senate presidency and had requested a secret vote.
But Flavio Bolsonaro revealed that he voted in favor of Alcolumbre, a move seen as indicating where the government's preference lay and likely dooming Calheiros, who subsequently withdrew.
""This process is not democratic,"" said Calheiros.
Calheiros enjoys strong support among the elder statesmen of the chamber, but is increasingly at odds with growing public resentment against the veteran political class, seen by many Brazilians as corrupt. 
He will now be the de facto head of a powerful group of senators that could pose a headache for Bolsonaro's legislative agenda in the upper house.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Egypt lawmakers to submit motion to amend constitution: agency,"CAIRO (Reuters) - A coalition of Egyptian parliamentarians will submit a request for constitutional amendments providing for a second chamber of parliament and the appointment of one or more deputy presidents, state news agency MENA reported on Saturday.
The move follows a separate attempt by a group of ordinary Egyptians to change presidential term limits in the constitution, which was adopted in 2014 after the military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following protests against his rule.
Speculation has been rife that the authorities will seek changes to the constitution, which limits a president to two four-year terms in office, since President Abdel Fattah Sisi’s re-election in March in a vote against a marginal opponent.
The lawmakers' proposed amendments will be presented to parliament speaker Ali Abdelaal on Sunday. Any changes need approval by two thirds of parliament members, followed by a referendum.
MENA said the lawmakers' proposed changes include restoring the Shura Council, an upper chamber that operated alongside the current 596-member House of Representatives until it was canceled in 2014, and the appointment of one deputy or more for the president.
The proposed amendments also include a quota guaranteeing women at least 25 percent of parliament seats for women, as well as ""adequate representation"" for youth, farmers, workers and the country's Christian minority.
There was no word on any proposed changes to the limit on presidential terms, but the head of the ""Support Egypt"" coalition, which is spearheading the amendments, Abdel-Hadi al-Qassabi, said that parliament members were entitled to present a request to amend any article in the constitution.
Qassabi said that article 226 of the constitution allows the president and five members of parliament to propose an amendment to any article of the constitution. 
MENA said in December that an Egyptian court had scheduled hearings of a petition by a number of ordinary Egyptians demanding that the parliament speaker take steps to introduce constitutional changes that would allow Sisi to seek re-election after his second term in office expires.
The petitioners argue that article 140 of the constitution, which sets the term limits, is ""unfair to the great Egyptian people"" and that eight years gives a president little time to deal with the economic and security challenges facing the country.

The projected 270 km (167 mile) line, which is estimated to cost some 26 billion euros ($30 billion) and will be partly paid for with French and European Union funds, has split the coalition government in Rome.
Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, one of the two ruling parties, said in a video on the Corriere.it website that ""as long as the 5-Star Movement is in government, as far as I am concerned, the Turin/Lyon high speed train has no future"".
He added that the project was supported by the country's ""worst lobbies"".
Italy is expected to decide by the end of May whether to complete the project, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli told Reuters.
Toninelli has asked a commission to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, with another group of lawyers examining the legal implications for Italy in case of it withdrawing from the project.
Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said later on Saturday that the government's program envisaged a ""revision"" of the project.
""We need to need to proceed with a cost-benefit analysis which will cover all technical, economic and social aspects and wait for it to be concluded to take a decision"" Conte said in a note.

The United Nations is trying to implement a truce and troop withdrawal accord in Hodeidah, the main entry point for most of Yemen's imports, as part of efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands and left millions on the brink of starvation.
The U.N. envoy for Yemen has urged the warring parties to withdraw their troops from the port quickly, and international aid agencies said conditions for thousands of starving people were deteriorating fast.
The truce in Hodeidah has largely been respected since coming into force a month ago, but skirmishes continue between the Houthi movement and their foes in a Saudi-led coalition fighting to restore the internationally-recognised government. 
A Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC), which is chaired by the world body and includes both sides, holds regular meetings to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire.
One of the sources said that the United Nations has hired a ship to be used as the headquarters for the RCC and its meetings. Another source said representatives of the warring parties would be taken to the ship on U.N. helicopters.
The RCC had previously met in Houthi-run territory, but attempts to convene a meeting in areas held by coalition forces failed because the Houthis were unwilling to cross the frontline, sources told Reuters in late January.
Troops have not yet pulled out, missing a Jan. 7 target, and residents and aid workers have told Reuters that barricades, trenches and roadblocks have been reinforced.
As part of the accord, both sides agreed to the deployment of international monitors in Hodeidah.
The next meeting of the RCC is expected next week after the arrival of Danish Major General Michael Anker Lollesgaar who was appointed on Thursday to replace retired General Patrick Cammaert. Lollesgaar is expected to arrive in Amman on Sunday and will travel to Hodeidah afterwards.
The Houthis control Hodeidah and coalition troops are massed on its outskirts. But the warring sides disagree over who should control the city and port after forces withdraw, and both sides have accused one another of violating the pact.
The U.N. envoy, Martin Griffiths, has been shuttling between the parties to rescue the deal, the first major diplomatic breakthrough of the nearly four-year-old war.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's prime minister on Saturday appeared to soften the official stance on more than a month of anti-government protests, describing demonstrators' calls for better living conditions as ""legitimate"". 
Students, activists and other protesters have held almost daily demonstrations across Sudan since Dec. 19, calling for an end to economic hardships and mounting a sustained challenge to President Omar al-Bashir’s three decades in power.
Rights groups say at least 45 people have been killed in the protests, while the government puts the death toll at 30, including two security personnel.
In the latest unrest-related death, a school teacher died in detention after being arrested in connection with protests in the east of the country, members of his family said on Saturday.
Bashir has shown no sign of being prepared to concede any power and has blamed the protests on foreign agents, challenging his rivals to seek power through the ballot box.
But Prime Minister Moataz Moussa took a softer tone, saying some of the demands of the protesters were legitimate and must be respected.
""There are problems and we are working on solving them,"" he told reporters, referring to Sudan's economic troubles and lack of services. 
""There is a voice that must be heard and must be respected, despite the presence of political parties. There are legitimate demands and demands that must be expressed.""
Sudan has been rapidly expanding its money supply in an attempt to finance its budget deficit. But that has caused spiraling inflation and a steep decline in the value of the country's currency on foreign exchange markets.
The 36-year-old teacher reported dead on Saturday had been arrested at his home on Thursday after protests in the town of Khashm al-Qirba, in the east of the country, the family members said. They added that security officials had told them he died of poisoning. 
He had marks of being beaten on his body, the family said. The man's funeral took place on Saturday. 
Security officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The information ministry said on Tuesday Sudan's intelligence and security chief had ordered the release of all those detained during the protests. However, the next day security forces detained the daughter of opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi, her family said. 
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges, which he denies, of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region. He has been lobbying to have Sudan removed from a list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism.
That listing has deterred the influx of investment and financial aid that Sudan was hoping for when the United States lifted sanctions in 2017, economists say.

Central African Republic has been rocked by violence since 2013 when mainly Muslim Selaka rebels ousted then president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias. U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in 2014.
""We have finalized a peace agreement in Khartoum, enabling the people of Central African Republic to embark on a path of reconciliation, agreement and development,"" the African Union's Commissioner for Peace and Security, Smaїl Chergui, said in a tweet on Saturday. 
The terms of the deal were not immediately clear.
Conflict in Central African Republic has uprooted more than one million people, the United Nations said, and has until now shown little sign of abating. 
The talks, which started on Jan. 24 with support from the United Nations and the African Union, were meant to stem the violence that has spread across the provinces and over which the overstretched armed forces have had little control. 
Peace is not certain, despite the deal. Similar agreements in 2014, 2015 and 2017 all broke apart.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A high-ranking Venezuelan general called on the armed forces to rebel against President Nicolas Maduro and to recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim chief as huge crowds rallied against the head of state, adding pressure on Maduro to step down.
The military's support is crucial for the embattled Maduro, who is deeply unpopular largely due to an unprecedented economic crisis that has prompted an exodus of millions, but claims he is victim of a coup directed by the United States.
The general's defection came as tens of thousands of opposition supporters, many sporting clothes in the yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan flag, turned out at rallies nationwide to protest against Maduro and show support for Guaido.
Washington, along with many countries in the western hemisphere, has recognized Guaido as the legitimate president, arguing that Maduro stole his second term, and imposed potentially crippling sanctions this week that are likely to further weaken the OPEC nation's struggling oil industry. 
While small rebellions against Maduro have broken out in Venezuela's armed forces in recent months, there has been no large scale military uprising against him.
""People of Venezuela, 90 percent of the armed forces of Venezuela are not with the dictator, they are with the people of Venezuela,"" General Francisco Yanez of the air force's high command said in a video circulating on Twitter on Saturday.
""Given the happenings of the last few hours, already the transition to democracy is imminent.""
On its Twitter account, the air force's high command accused the general of treason.
Yanez is the first active Venezuelan general to recognize Guaido since he proclaimed himself president on Jan. 23. Venezuela's chief military attache to the United States also said he was defecting last week.
Canada and several Latin American nations have already officially recognized Guiado. Some European Union member states are expected to officially recognize Guaido next week, while others will likely take a more cautious stance of support.
""We are going to send a very clear message in all the municipalities of Venezuela and in each city of the world, we are going to give a demonstration of strength, in a pacific and organized manner,"" Guaido tweeted on Saturday.
Mireanna Fernandez, a 20-year-old student at a protest in the eastern city of Ciudad Guayana, said before Guaido's Jan. 23 proclamation she wanted to leave Venezuela, but now she had hope that Maduro's government would end.
""I have no quality of life, I can't go out onto the streets, my university is falling apart, they've closed classrooms, there are no teachers,"" she said.
""It's time they leave.""
TWO DECADES OF 'CHAVISMO'
Maduro on Saturday will also hold a rally to commemorate the 20th anniversary of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez's first inauguration as president in 1999.
""Today is the anniversary of 20 years of work, fight, advances and important achievements, despite the difficulties and imperial conspiracies,"" the president said on twitter.
""Congratulations to all.""
Supporters of the ""chavismo"" movement founded by Chavez gathered in Caracas' Bolivar avenue for the government rally on Saturday morning. 
""For us Venezuelans, there is only one president - President Nicolas Maduro,"" said Gregory Carrasquel, 35. ""The other is someone who is being led to carry out a coup.""
""(U.S. President Donald) Trump is imposing measures because he is the dictator of the world and thinks we are his slaves.""
Washington has imposed sweeping sanctions on state-owned oil firm PDVSA in the toughest financial challenge yet to Maduro, as the Trump administration openly seeks to push him from power.
Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation, produce shortages and a mass migration of citizens to neighboring Latin American countries - a situation likely to be worsened in the short term by the new sanctions.
Guaido swore himself in as interim president in a direct challenge to Maduro's rule, but still has no control over state institutions or any functions of day-to-day governance.

Maduro's adversaries say he has run roughshod over democratic institutions, including the opposition-run congress, and destroyed the once-buoyant economy through a corruption-riddled exchange control system and arbitrary nationalizations.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Saturday said it had lodged a protest with the United States government after several Indian students were detained there in connection with their enrolment in a fake university, following an undercover operation by U.S. agents.
U.S. authorities this week said eight individuals who exploited the country's student visa system had been indicted. They had helped foreign nationals illegally remain in the United States by enrolling them into a metro Detroit private university, which was actually being operated by U.S. agents themselves. (https:// The recruiters helped the students to fraudulently obtain immigration documents from the school in a bid to deceive authorities, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. The foreign students, however, had no intention of attending school, it added. Though the U.S. government did not disclose nationalities of those involved, the Indian foreign ministry on Saturday said ""several Indian students"" had been detained. Indian media said more than 100 students had been detained in the United States. The Indian government had issued a rare ""demarche"" to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, telling it that Indian officials needed immediate consular access to the detainees. ""We underlined that students, who may have been duped into enrolling in the 'University', should be treated differently from those recruiters who have duped them,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement. The Indian government also urged the United States to release the students from detention at the earliest, without resorting to deportation against their will. The United States agency had said that the defendants in the case ""intended to help shield and hide"" the students from United States immigration authorities for money. They collectively profited in excess of a $250,000, the agency said.  ""These suspects aided hundreds of foreign nationals to remain in the United States illegally by helping to portray them as students, which they most certainly were not,"" Special Agent in charge Steve Francis said this week. China, India and South Korea together sent 56.1 percent of all international students in the United States in 2017-18, an annual survey by the Institute of International Education showed last year.

Iran has expanded its missile program, particularly its ballistic missiles, in defiance of opposition from the United States and expressions of concern by European countries. Tehran says the program is purely defensive.
""This cruise missile needs a very short time for its preparedness and can fly at a low altitude,"" Defense Minister Amir Hatami said during the unveiling ceremony.
The surface-to-surface missile, named Hoveizeh, is from the Soumar family of cruise missiles, which Iran added to its arsenal in 2015, Hatami said. 
Western experts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although there are concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles.
Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace division, said at the event Iran had overcome initial problems in producing jet engines for cruise missiles and could now manufacture a full range of the weapons.
The Defense Ministry's website carried an undated video purportedly showing the Hoveizeh being test-fired from a mobile launcher. It quoted Hatami as saying the missile had successfully hit targets at a distance of 1,200 km.
Since agreeing to a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran has expanded its missile program despite warnings from the United States. 
In January, it tried to launch a satellite into space which it said failed. The launch followed a U.S. warning to Iran against undertaking three planned rocket launches that Washington said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution.
The resolution, which enshrined Iran’s nuclear deal, called upon Tehran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons.
Iran says its missile tests are not in violation of the resolution and denies its missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. It says its missiles are defensive and used for deterrence and has rejected talks over its missile program. 
U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.
Washington says although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile program or curb what the United States says is interference in regional affairs. 

Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of decades-long international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing most weapons.

PARIS (Reuters) - Several thousand ""yellow vest"" protesters marched through Paris and other French cities on Saturday on the 12th weekend of action against the government, despite opinion polls pointing to a recovery in President Emmanuel Macron's popularity. 
The protests - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - began in mid-November over plans to raise fuel taxes before developing into a broader revolt against the government that mobilized tens of thousands of demonstrators nationwide each Saturday.
The government warned on Friday police would not hesitate to use flash balls in case of violence by demonstrators after it was authorized by France's highest administrative court.
Protesters in Paris on Saturday paid homage to those injured in the past months, denouncing the use of flash ball riot control guns banned in much of Europe.
Between 10,000 and 13,800 protested in the capital according to police and independent media estimates. Riot police used tear gas to disperse some protesters who set bins and a scooter alight, although the situation remained relatively calm compared to previous weekends. Thousands also took to the streets in cities, including Tours, Valence, Marseille and Bordeaux. 
About 1,000 police officers have been injured along with 1,700 demonstrators since the start of the protests, according to official figures.
""It's true that this intermediate weapon can hurt, but faced with rioters, the police need it to defend themselves against those who attack them,"" said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Opinion polls show a recovery in Macron's battered popularity rating after he launched consultations, including town hall debates, to try to quell social unrest.
A Harris Interactive poll of 1,000 people on Friday showed Macron gaining 4 percentage points since December taking him to a 35 percent approval rating. 
As in previous weeks, protesters on Saturday carried French flags and held signs attacking Macron as out of touch or calling for referendums tabled by citizens.
Protesters injured in previous weeks of violence were put at the front of the protests with some wearing eye patches with a target sign on them. 

The Interior Ministry said 80,000 security officials had been mobilized, including 5,000 in Paris.

The announcement, made late on Friday, followed the debacle last year of Chancellor Angela Merkel missing the start of a Buenos Aires summit of G20 global leaders after a radio failure made her government jet turn back mid-flight.
Defense Minister Ursula Von Der Leyden said Germany would buy a new Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 later this year, with two other jets to follow.
Buying jets straight from the production line would be a new move for the air force's VIP transport wing: Germany currently operates two aging second-hand A340s, which are no longer made, as well as some smaller aircraft.
The high-profile fleet breakdowns have highlighted the armed forces' broader struggles with trying to raise their level of technical readiness as traditionally placid Berlin moves cautiously toward a more interventionist global posture.
A string of procurement delays, cost overruns and technical mismatches have interfered with attempts to renew the country's naval fleet, while deadlines for selecting a new warplane fleet have repeatedly been missed.

Following Merkel G20 debacle, in January international development minister Gerd Mueller was briefly stranded in Malawi after another government jet broke down.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has suspended the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday, after the United States said it would withdraw from the arms control pact, accusing Moscow of violations.
Moscow's relations with the West are strained over issues including Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, allegations of meddling in the U.S. presidential election and being behind a nerve agent attack in Britain.
The United States announced on Friday it will withdraw from the INF treaty in six months unless Moscow ends what it says are violations of the 1987 pact.
It would reconsider its withdrawal if Russia came into compliance with the agreement, which bans both nations from stationing short- and intermediate-range land-based missiles in Europe. Russia denies violating the treaty.
""The American partners have declared that they suspend their participation in the deal, we suspend it as well,"" Putin said during a televised meeting with foreign and defense ministers.
(For a graphic on U.S. nuclear arsenal - https://tmsnrt.rs/2sYZOpw)
Putin said Russia will start work on creating new missiles, including hypersonic ones, and told ministers not to initiate disarmament talks with Washington, accusing the United States of being slow to respond to such moves.
""We have repeatedly, during a number of years, and constantly raised a question about substantiative talks on the disarmament issue,"" Putin said. ""We see that in the past few years the partners have not supported our initiatives.""
The row over the treaty has drawn a strong reaction from Europe and China.
European nations fear the treaty's collapse could lead to a new arms race with possibly a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles stationed on the continent.
China urged the United States on Saturday to resolve its differences with Russia through dialogue.
During the meeting with Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the United States of violating the INF and other arms deals, including the non-proliferation treaty.

Putin said Russia would not deploy its weapons in Europe and other regions unless the United States did so.

Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it had killed 16 Ethiopian soldiers, although the claim could not be independently verified.
A local elder who witnessed the attack told Reuters the explosion had killed 10 people including soldiers and civilians. ""The mini bus was very dusty, it must have come from a far region, it was fired (on) as it started speeding up,"" he said. 
Police officer Major Nur Abdullahi told Reuters from the town of Bardheere where the attack occurred that the vehicle involved was a mini bus carrying vegetables as a disguise.
""It was fired (on) before it reached the gate. We understand there are casualties,"" the officer said.
Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia's western-backed central government and establish its own rule, based on a strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law. 
The group regularly stages attacks against the Somali military and against troops from the African Union-mandated peacekeeping force AMISOM. Ethiopia is one of the countries contributing troops to AMISOM, alongside Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and others. 
Somalia has been gripped by violence since the early 1990s after the toppling of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

The clash with more than 100 members of the Abu Sayyaf group broke out in the town of Patikul in the Sulu province at 11:30 a.m. as troops pursued those behind a church attack on Sunday, Colonel Gerry Besana, spokesman for the military's Western Mindanao Command said.
The church bombing in Sulu, which killed 22 people and wounded more than 100 including civilians and soldiers, was a suicide attack carried out by an Indonesian couple, with help of the Abu Sayyaf group, Interior Minister Eduardo Año said on Friday. 
Abu Sayyaf is a militant organization notorious for kidnappings and extremist factions and has pledged allegiance to Islamic State. Sulu province, in the country's Mindanao region, is a known stronghold of the group.
The encounter in Patikul lasted nearly two hours, Besana said, with five soldiers and 15 militants also wounded. 
Martial law has been in place in Mindanao since domestic and foreign fighters dressed in black outfits overran Marawi City in 2017 and clung on through five months of air strikes and street battles reminiscent of scenes in Syria and Iraq.

It said former parliamentarian Gultan Kisanak, who was arrested in 2016 when she was the joint mayor of Diyarbakir city in southeast Turkey, was jailed for 14 years and three months.
Sebahat Tuncel, who had also served in parliament, was jailed for 15 years, the agency said. She has been on hunger strike for three weeks and did not attend the court hearing.
Kisanak rejected the charges in court and said she had been held for two years before Friday's sentencing. 
""I do what I do because it is true, legal, legitimate, humanitarian,"" Demiroren quoted her as saying. ""Everything I do is in the frame of democratic politics.""
Kisanak was arrested in October 2016 and accused of making speeches in support of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since the 1980s. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the violence.
Turkey, the European Union and the United States have all designated the PKK a terrorist organization.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Two lawyers hired by the wife of an Australian detained in Beijing for suspected espionage said they have been denied access to him by Chinese authorities on the grounds that the detainee did not agree to their appointment.
Yang Hengjun, a 53-year-old Chinese-born writer, was detained in the southern city of Guangzhou while waiting for a transfer to Shanghai last month, after flying in from New York.
He was taken to Beijing, where China has said the city's State Security Bureau is holding him under ""coercive measures"", a euphemism for detention, as he is investigated on suspicion of ""endangering state security"".
One of the lawyers, Mo Shaoping, said the state security bureau informed him on Friday that Yang ""did not accept lawyers appointed by his family"", but that the bureau rejected his request to verify this with Yang in person. 
""The thing we're most concerned about is whether this is the real wish of Yang Hengjun,"" the other lawyer, Shang Baojun, told Reuters, adding that they hoped to glean more information when Australian consular officials are allowed to meet with him next.
China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contact details. The Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on Saturday, but has previously said that Yang's rights and interests were being protected in accordance with the law.
Mo previously told Reuters that his client was suspected of ""espionage"", and was being held under ""residential surveillance at a designated location"".

The special detention measure allows authorities to interrogate suspects for six months without necessarily granting access to legal representation. Rights groups say that the lack of oversight raises concern about abuse by interrogators.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",Three women who could be Modi's biggest nightmare in India's election,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three powerful women politicians, each from a very different section of Indian society, may pose a big threat to the chances of Prime Minister Narendra Modi winning a second term in a general election due by May.
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, part of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for much of the time since its independence from the British in 1947, joined the struggle in January, when the opposition Congress party made her its face in the nation's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.
Two other senior female politicians - the firebrand chief minister of West Bengal state, Mamata Banerjee, and Mayawati, a former Uttar Pradesh chief minister - are also plotting to unseat Modi's ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition by forming big opposition groupings, though there is no firm agreement between them as yet.
""The opposition has more powerful women leaders than the NDA, and therefore they will be able to carry conviction with voters generally, and with women voters, in particular,"" said Yashwant Sinha, 81, a former finance minister who quit Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which dominates the NDA, last year.
""They should be very worried, especially after the defeat in the three major Hindi heartland states,"" he said, referring to BJP's losses in recent state elections.
The entry of Priyanka - she is usually referred to by just her first name - into the political fray drew a gushing reaction from much of the Indian media.
There were pictures of elated supporters dancing, a lot of talk of the 47-year-old's resemblance to her grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and comments about her gifts as a speaker able to connect with voters. That contrasts with her brother, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who in the past has been criticized for lacking the common touch.
TRIPLE CHALLENGE
The other two women seen threatening Modi's grip on power have a lot more experience than Priyanka, and both could be seen as potential prime ministerial candidates in a coalition government. 
Mayawati, a 63-year-old former teacher who goes by just the one name, last month formed an alliance between her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) – which mainly represents Hinduism's lowest caste, the Dalits - and its once bitter foes, the Samajwadi Party that tends to draw support from other lower castes and Muslims.
Then there is 64-year-old Banerjee, who has twice been railways minister in federal governments. Last month, Banerjee – who built her All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) party after leaving Congress in 1997 - organized an anti-BJP rally in Kolkata that attracted hundreds of thousands.
Party colleagues of the three women leaders said they were not available for comment.
To be sure, Modi remains, for now, the most popular leader in the country, opinion polls show. 
Modi also cannot be accused of ignoring women's issues during his first term. He has launched a government campaign - Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, or ""Save the Daughter, Educate the Daughter"" - and called for the eradication of female foeticide. His campaigns to provide toilets and subsidized gas cylinders for poorer Indians are often promoted as ways to empower women.
He has six women in his 26-strong cabinet, though a lot of power is centralized with Modi and a couple of senior male lieutenants.
The BJP said it would seek votes on the basis of achievements under Modi and the opposition did not have a ""positive alternative to the government, and its activities"". 
PERSONAL TIES
Congress has said it wants to form a post-poll partnership with Mayawati's BSP and SP alliance, though it will be fighting against it in 78 seats. The alliance will not contest two Gandhi strongholds won multiple times by Rahul and his mother Sonia.
Mayawati told a press conference announcing the alliance with the SP that Congress was not part of it because they did not think ""there would be much benefit in having them with us before the election"".
The BSP, however, backs Congress-led governments in the northern states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
There is no formal alliance between Banerjee and Congress, though she does know Rahul and Priyanka.
Dinesh Trivedi, a former federal minister and a close aide to Banerjee, said she enjoys a good personal relationship with Sonia Gandhi, the matriarch of the dynasty and a former Congress president, and so working with her two children would not be a problem.
""In terms of experience, Mamata Banerjee is far ahead,"" Trivedi said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi would look at Mamata Banerjee as somebody who could really inspire them.""
The strength of Priyanka, Mayawati and Banerjee as a potential opposition alliance is that they can appeal to different parts of the electorate.
Two Congress sources said the formal entry into politics of Priyanka could help rejuvenate the party in Uttar Pradesh, where it is a marginal player. Coming from what is India's first family, they said she could appeal to upper caste voters in the state who typically vote for the pro-business BJP.
A Congress leader close to the Gandhis said she would attract women, young people, and floating voters.
Priyanka is far from a political neophyte, having supported her brother and mother during previous election campaigns. She has also experienced political and personal tragedy, as Rahul Gandhi stressed in a speech last week. 
""You have to understand my relationship with my sister – we have been through a hell of a lot together,"" he said.
""Everybody is like 'look, you come from this illustrious family, and everything is easy'. Actually it's not so easy. My father was assassinated, my grandmother was assassinated, huge political battles, wins in political battles, losses in political battles.""
""NATIONAL LEADER""
BSP spokesman Sudhindra Bhadoria said Mayawati's gender did not matter.
""She has managed a party from scratch to this level. The important fact is that she has organized large numbers, both men and women, Dalits, other backward castes, the poor, minorities,"" Bhadoria said. ""I don't fit them in the straightjacket of male-female. I think she's a national leader.""
She is regarded as ambitious. A U.S. diplomatic cable in 2008, among many thousands leaked by Wikileaks two years later, described her as ""first-rate egomaniac"" who ""is obsessed with becoming prime minister"".
But Mayawati has also been credited with empowering oppressed lower caste Hindus.

Banerjee, who defeated a 34-year-old communist government in West Bengal in an election in 2011, is known for her streetwise political skills and portrays herself as a secular leader in a country polarized under the BJP.

The attack targeted a base of the Basij, a paramilitary force affiliated with the powerful Revolutionary Guards, in the city of Nik Shahr in Sistan-Baluchestan province, which has long been plagued by unrest from both drug smuggling gangs and Sunni Muslim militants.
On Tuesday, Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) claimed responsibility for two bombings that wounded three police officers in front of a police station in the city of Zahedan, capital of Sistan-Baluchestan province.
Iran began on Friday ten days of state-sponsored celebrations marking the 1979 Islamic Revolution which deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a secular king allied to the West.
U.S. President Donald Trump last year pulled out of an international agreement under which Iran curbed its nuclear work in exchange for a sanctions relief. The reimposed sanctions led to a currency crash, rampant inflation and added to investors’ hesitancy about doing business there.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Once-in-a-century flooding in part of the eastern Australian state of Queensland looks set to worsen as the nation's weather bureau on Saturday warned of more heavy rain in the area.
Some residents have already been evacuated after days of monsoon rains lashed the region around the coastal city of Townsville in north Queensland, a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said. 
Adam Blazak, a forecaster with the bureau, did not say how many people had been evacuated, but added that some areas had reached ""major"" flood levels.
""Normally a monsoonal burst might last a few days, but this one's been going on over a week now and is set to continue for a few more days as well,"" he said.
Between 150 mm and 200 mm of rain is expected across Townsville on Saturday - equal to about a month's average rainfall.
Local authorities issued a number of flood warnings on Saturday morning and told residents to avoid using roads and consider moving to higher ground if conditions worsen.
North Queensland has significant zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore, with Townsville a major processing center for the region's base metals.
In stark contrast, wildfires in the southern island state of Tasmania have burnt through close to 190,000 hectares of land, fire officials said.
Chris Arnold, the chief officer of the Tasmania Fire Service, said on Saturday that nearly 600 personnel were working to contain the fires, some of which have been burning for weeks and have destroyed homes.
Arnold told reporters that while the last few days have seen favorable conditions for battling the blazes, communities in part of the state were still under threat as expected hot and dry weather on Sunday could see bushfires escalate again. 
Australia endured its hottest month on record in January, with sweltering conditions expected to persist through April. That scorching weather triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring.

Rees-Mogg, who chairs the influential pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) within May's party, said a short extension to the timetable could be accepted if the government had struck a deal with Europe along the lines of the so-called Malthouse Compromise. 
Britain's parliament has demanded that May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal after her original plan was rejected by lawmakers. Rees-Mogg has put forward a new plan called the Malthouse Compromise after one of its proponents, lawmaker Kit Malthouse.
It courts Brexiteers with a promise to ditch an unpopular Irish border policy in favor of an alternative and appeals to pro-EU Conservatives by pledging safeguards against the risk of disruption if no exit deal can be agreed with Brussels.
Rees-Mogg wrote in the Telegraph newspaper that both Brussels and Westminster could move at speed when they need to. 
""Currently, there are only 55 days left to Brexit,"" he wrote in the newspaper due to be published on Saturday. ""This makes the timetable tight for agreeing and legislating for a deal.
""If the agreement were made but a little parliamentary time were needed ... a short extension is not impossible.""

Other senior lawmakers in May's Cabinet have in recent days suggested a small delay may be needed as Britain races to be ready to leave the EU on March 29.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's lower house of Congress reelected on Friday by a vast majority Rodrigo Maia, from the Democratas party, for a new two-year term as president of the chamber.
Maia had the support of Brazil's newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro and has pledged to work with the new administration to pass key reforms seen as crucial for the country to balance its budget, such as the pension reform.
Maia obtained 334 of 513 available votes. His nearest competitor, Fabio Ramalho from MDB party, received 66 votes.
""The reforms are not simple, but they are necessary,"" Maia said in a speech before the vote.
The command of both houses of Congress is key for Bolsonaro and his team to advance with plans to change not only the pension system, but other legislations including tax for corporations and a plan to privatize a large number of state-owned companies. 
Bolsonaro, who is still recovering from surgery in a Sao Paulo hospital, congratulated Maia for the reelection in a message on Twitter. ""It is a position of extreme responsibility, to lead the voting process of bills the Brazilian people strongly support,"" he said. 
Brazil's Senate, which had been expected to also elect its new president on Friday, postponed the decision to Saturday due to divergences regarding the voting process.

DORAL, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday listened to harrowing stories of deprivation, torture and escape from Venezuelans who fled their homeland, and pledged to ramp up pressure to help the opposition trying to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
In a visit to the largest community of Venezuelan exiles in the United States - and flanked by four prominent Florida Republican politicians - Pence rejected calls for talks with Maduro, and said all options were on the table to force him to leave.
""This is no time for dialogue. This is time for action,"" Pence told a few hundred people at a rally in a local church, many of whom waved Venezuelan flags and shouted ""Libertad!""
""The time has come to end the Maduro dictatorship once and for all,"" said Pence, who has emerged as one of the strongest voices against the Venezuelan leader in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The U.S. government has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. Most Latin American countries have done so as well, while European governments are also throwing their support behind Guaido, albeit more cautiously.
Russia and China, among others, back Maduro, who has said National Assembly head Guaido's self-declared claim to the presidency is an attempted U.S.-backed coup.
Maduro, who began a second term last month after elections last year that were dismissed by the West as a sham, has said he would be ready for talks with the opposition. Some countries, including Mexico and Uruguay, have offered to mediate. 
Similar talks in the past have failed, and opposition leaders have said Maduro uses them to stall for time.
A former union leader who succeeded his charismatic mentor, the late President Hugo Chavez, Maduro has overseen a shrinking economy and the migration of more than 3 million Venezuelans fleeing food and drug shortages and hyperinflation.
While most have left for other South American countries, thousands have made their way to southern Florida, joining migrants from Cuba and other parts of Latin America. They form an important voting constituency in a swing state often critical to the outcome of U.S. national elections.
Pence shared the stage with Republican senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, and Governor Ron DeSantis.
EMACIATED CHILD
Pence said the United States was working to get more aid to Venezuela. The State Department last week promised a fresh $20 million in help, adding to the $140 million it has spent in neighboring countries grappling with the influx of refugees.
""The United States of America stands ready to deliver humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people in Venezuela as well,"" Pence said, adding that the administration would work with the opposition-run National Assembly to do so.
Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet on Friday that the United States ""will mobilize and transport humanitarian aid - medicine, surgical supplies, and nutritional supplements for the people of Venezuela.""
Before the campaign-style rally, Pence met with some exiled Venezuelans, including a man who said he spent years in prison where he was tortured, and a doctor who brandished a poster-sized photo of what he said was an emaciated child suffering from food shortages in the oil-rich country.
Mayra Lopez told Pence her family was scattered across Latin America. ""Being here now at this moment, we see hope finally,"" she said, speaking through a translator.

""We're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. And we believe this is the moment.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has apologized to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test in a widely criticized effort to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, the tribe said on Friday.
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, called Bill John Baker, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, on Thursday to apologize for taking the DNA test last year, said Julie Hubbard, a Cherokee Nation spokeswoman.
""It was a brief and private conversation but I understand that she did apologize for causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted,"" Hubbard said in a statement.
The chief and other tribal leaders appreciate that Warren ""reaffirmed she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen - or a citizen of any tribal nation,"" Hubbard said.
A Warren spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
Warren angered tribal leaders and some of her fellow Democrats when she decided to take the test to put to rest criticism from Republicans of her ancestry claims.
The most notable critic has been Republican President Donald Trump, who frequently belittles Warren by calling her ""Pocahontas.""
The results found Warren had at least one Native American ancestor many generations ago. But Native American leaders criticized Warren for using a DNA test to lay claim to even a vague connection to a tribal nation, saying culture and sovereignty were just as important as blood and the tests did not confer the rights of tribal citizenship.
Democrats feared Warren was playing into the hands of Trump and other Republicans by engaging them on the issue.
Warren has created an exploratory committee to begin raising money and hiring staff for a run at the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. She is expected to formally launch her campaign later this month.
At a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa, last month, Warren told a voter who expressed concern about the decision that given the political attacks, she had decided ""to put it all out there.""

""I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference,"" Warren said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States announced on Friday it will withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in six months unless Moscow ends its alleged violations of the landmark 1987 arms control pact.
The United States would reconsider its withdrawal if Russia, which denies violating the treaty, came into compliance with the agreement, which bans both nations from stationing short- and intermediate-range land-based missiles in Europe.
Announcing the move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would cease to regard itself as being bound by the treaty starting Saturday, which is when Washington will formally inform Moscow of its intent to withdraw, a senior U.S. official told reporters.
The announcement may aim to pressure Russia to come to terms during the next six months but it also raised fears of a new U.S.-Russian nuclear arms race in Europe as well as one between the United States and China in Asia.
U.S. President Donald Trump repeated U.S. allegations that Russia had violated the INF treaty, which limited only U.S. and Russian arsenals, and he held out the prospect of negotiating a wider agreement, possibly including other nations.
""I hope that we’re able to get everybody in a big and beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better. Certainly I would like to see that,"" Trump told reporters.
Trump's tenure has been dogged by allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election to help his candidacy, which Moscow denies. The dispute over INF has contributed to U.S.-Russia frictions, now at their worst since the Cold War ended in 1991 despite Trump's stated desire for better ties. 
""If Russia does not return to full and verifiable compliance with the treaty within this six-month period by verifiably destroying its INF-violating missiles, their launchers, and associated equipment, the treaty will terminate,"" Pompeo told reporters.
(Graphic: U.S. nuclear arsenal - https://tmsnrt.rs/2sYZOpw)
RUSSIA SEES FALSE PRETEXT
Russian officials accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty that it wants to leave anyway so it can develop new missiles.
Speaking before the announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia regretted the expected U.S. move and accused Washington of failing to negotiate to avoid such an outcome.
""The unwillingness of the Americans to listen to any arguments and to hold substantive negotiations with us shows that the decision to break this treaty was taken in Washington a long time ago,"" Peskov told reporters.
The United States alleges a new Russian cruise missile violates the pact. The missile, the Novator 9M729, is known as the SSC-8 by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The treaty required the parties to destroy ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 km (310 to 3,420 miles). Last week, the head of Russia's military's missile and artillery forces said the new missile's maximum range fell short of the treaty's lower limit.
Russia has rejected the U.S. demand to destroy the new missile.
NATO ""does not have any intention to deploy new land-based nuclear weapons to Europe,"" Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters on Friday, saying the Western security alliance had intelligence from the United States and other allies confirming that Russia had violated the treaty.
""We don't have to mirror what Russia does. But at the same time we have to make sure that we maintain credible and effective deterrence,"" he said, without giving specifics on military options NATO is considering.
France and Germany both emphasized the importance of using the six-month window to keep talking.
Formal U.S. withdrawal could give the Pentagon new options to counter Chinese missile advances but experts warn the ensuing arms race could greatly escalate tensions in the Asia-Pacific. 
The United States will notify Russia on Saturday of its plan to pull out in six months, a senior U.S. official said, describing this as ""one final chance"" to comply with the agreement but saying Washington doubted Moscow would do so.
He said the administration is weighing whether to extend the ""New Start"" arms control treaty, which went into effect in 2011 and required both nations to cut deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades.

That treaty, which also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers, expires in February 2021, can be extended by five years if both sides agree.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 03:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Argentina's Fernandez plans election run against Macri - sources,"By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Former Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner intends to run for the office again this year, two sources close to left-leaning politician told Reuters, the strongest indication yet that the populist leader will look to mount a challenge to incumbent Mauricio Macri.
Fernández, who has yet to formally announce herself as a candidate in the elections in October, would make boosting consumer purchasing power a focus, the sources said, a counter to Macri's austerity push that has dented his popularity.
The election run, if confirmed, would make Fernández the first and most high-profile challenger to Macri, who is expected to run for a second term but whose leadership has faced heavy criticism after rampant inflation last year and a falling economy hit voters hard.
A Macri versus Fernández battle would likely dominate the election process in what will be a major crossroads for Argentina's economic and political future: a choice between Macri's IMF-backed economic reforms or a return to Peronism.
Fernandez - who led the country from 2007 through 2015 and is now a senator - is Macri's arch political rival and is among his main critics from within the country's Peronist movement. 
A spokesman for Fernandez's party did not directly confirm that she would be a candidate when asked by Reuters, but said any government from her faction would look to bolster the purchasing power of workers to support the domestic market.
""She will be (a candidate) because she does not have any other option,"" said one source, a strategy advisor to Fernandez, asking not to be named because the run was not yet public. 
A second source close to the former president also said she would run and that she was the best candidate to lead the country.
Fernandez was indicted last year on charges that her administration accepted bribes from construction companies in exchange for public works contracts.

Fernandez has denied the charges and said she never received any illicit money. As a senator, she has immunity from arrest, but not from prosecution.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",From sleaze to seaweed: Macron confronts French anger in debates,"By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron showed a trademark mix of bluntness and humor to field questions from overseas mayors at a debate at the Elysee Palace on Friday, one of a myriad of consultations he launched last month to quell social unrest.
The meeting with about 60 mayors from overseas territories - some of them having traveled 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) to see him - was part of a two-month ""great national debate"" Macron launched to mollify the ""yellow vest"" movement.
Yet discussion ranged from the price of cars in Guadeloupe to poisonous brown seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. 
""What I want with this format is to have a very frank and direct discussion,"" Macron told mayors from French territories such as Reunion island in the Pacific Ocean and Martinique in the Caribbean at the start of the more than four-hour meeting.
The yellow vests, named after high-visibility jackets French drivers keep in cars, threw Macron onto the defensive late last year. Their initial protests - against fuel tax hikes that Macron then scrapped - spiraled into a broader movement against the political elite and inequality, triggering some of the worst violence in Paris in decades.
Six weeks on, Macron is back on the offensive and polls point to a recovery in popularity. Successful outings to a trio of townhall debates with local mayors and disenchanted voters have re-energized the president.
SHIRT-SLEEVE BLUNTNESS
On Friday, Macron listened to grievances from the mayors, who complained about the cost of living on remote islands and unemployment levels much higher than mainland France.
However, he responded bluntly to many demands, refusing more money and explaining that one reason behind the higher cost of many products overseas was cartels and corruption.
""The gap between the price of a car you buy in Guadeloupe or Martinique and one on the mainland can be thousands of euros,"" Macron said, his shirtsleeves rolled-up. 
""This thousands-euro difference goes into someone's pocket. Let's not lie to ourselves ... Sometimes it's people who have been longtime members of the local political life,"" he added, to grumbles in the audience.
When one mayor said the 5 million euros spent fighting the Sargassum seaweed choking Caribbean resorts was not enough, Macron replied: ""Mr Mayor, it's not because there's a massive phenomenon that spending 10 times more money on it will fix it! We need to understand what's going on first."" 
Since the first one on Jan. 15, Macron has used the debates to explain policies in simple terms - in contrast with the long speeches peppered with obscure words such as ""palimpsest"" he favored after election. 
Many have drawn parallels with his feisty performance in campaign rallies in 2016-2017.
That no-nonsense style was on full display on Friday. 
To one mayor who complained about subsidies being cut, only to be contradicted by an adviser, Macron replied in jest: ""You just got caught by the cops!"" 

To another, a former minister under Socialist leader Francois Hollande, he quipped: ""It's not as if you had been minister for overseas territories in the past!"", to laughter in the audience.

The searches took place near the County Louth village of Omeath, which lies on a small peninsula separating part of the border between European Union-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
The currently seamless border will become the United Kingdom's only land frontier with the EU when it leaves the bloc, scheduled for the end of March.
Police on both sides have warned that any hardening of the border as a result of Brexit, with the potential return of customs posts, could be a target for the small number of militant groups still active in Northern Ireland after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence in the province.
""During the searches to date Gardaí (Irish police) have recovered a substantial quantity of ammunition of varied caliber along with a mortar tube (pending examination by Garda ballistics experts),"" the police said in a statement.
The recovery of the ammunition was part of ongoing police investigations targeting militant groups based in the area. The army's bomb disposal unit was assisting at the scene, the statement added.
A militant group calling itself the ""IRA"" said this week it was responsible for a car bomb which detonated outside a court house in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry in January, highlighting the threat still posed by groups opposed to the peace agreement.
No one was injured in the blast, which the group said was not linked to Brexit.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>","As U.S. starts deportations, asylum-seekers face perils in Mexico","By Delphine Schrank
REYNOSA, Mexico (Reuters) - Central Americans who fled violence for refuge in the United States risk kidnapping or death under a new U.S. plan to deport them to murderous and cartel-wracked Mexican border cities while their asylum cases are processed.
The city of Reynosa, and a nearby stretch of the Rio Grande that divides Texas from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, is by far the busiest crossing point along the northern Mexican border for migrants seeking asylum in the United States.
But Reynosa is a wasteland of vandalized and abandoned homes in a state that is a key battlefield in Mexico's bloody drug wars. With cartel factions fighting for lucrative drug trafficking routes, civilians are often caught in the crossfire. 
On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump launched a plan to return Central American asylum-seekers to Mexico rather than have them wait in the United States - dubbed the Migration Protection Protocols. The first return of an asylum-seeker took place in Mexico's west coast city of Tijuana, at the opposite end of the border from Reynosa. [nL1N1ZQ0F7]
U.S. authorities plan to gradually widen the program to other legal ports of entry, including Tamaulipas, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
""We're returning them to where they came in,"" said DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman.
Last year, 32,521 people asked for asylum in the Rio Grande Valley sector that skirts the river in southern Texas, after being caught by border agents on river banks and in fields, or after walking up to ports of entry - more than half the cases for the entire 2000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
Asked to comment on the risks of returning migrants to a country afflicted with disappearances and violent crime, Waldman said: ""That's no more dangerous than some of these violent parts of the United States, like Chicago.""
In 2017, FBI data indicates that Chicago, one of the most violent cities in the United States, had a homicide rate of about 24 murders per 100,000 residents, similar to the level in Tamaulipas cited by the interior ministry.
In Mexico, however, around 90 percent of crimes went unreported last year, the national statistics office estimated, while the data does not include unresolved disappearances, reckoned by Geovanni Barrios, president of Justicia Tamaulipas, at over 34,000 in Tamaulipas alone. 
The border zone has become a central theater of conflict since the Mexican government launched a militarized effort against the cartels in 2006 and they began fragmenting. According to information from the defense ministry, 130 soldiers have since died in Tamaulipas, more than in any other Mexican state.
Now, splinter groups of the Gulf and Zeta drug cartels fight pitched battles for territory in armored vehicles emblazoned with their emblems. Hundreds of unidentified bodies lie in unmarked graves.
The U.S. State Department has a ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"" warning for five Mexican states including Tamaulipas, more frequently leveled in active war zones.
The project of securely hosting Central Americans while U.S. immigration judges adjudicate their cases seems a pipe dream, according to Reynosa's mayor, Maki Ortiz.
""We don't have the capacity. We don't have the resources, the infrastructure or the budget for them,"" Ortiz said, adding that no one had earmarked the extra funds for a city that barely has the means to combat its criminals.
STAYING INSIDE 
Unlike recent caravans of migrants that headed for Tijuana, often several hundred people strong, most of those who journey to Reynosa make their way alone, or aided by clandestine people smugglers.
Dependent on those smugglers to guide them for a steep fee over the Rio Grande with the assent of cartel factions that control parts of the riverbank, they wait nervously in ""safe houses"" for their appointed crossing hour.
Or they ponder their options in the Senda de Vida shelter - the only one to accept Central Americans - in a district dominated by the Gulf cartel, who are blamed for multiple kidnappings and disappearances. Migrants at the shelter are warned not to venture out alone.
""I've never even seen the city since I arrived at the bus terminal,"" said Maria Alfaro, 51, a Honduran cook staying in the shelter.
Too old to find work in a factory in Honduras, she came to Mexico hoping for job, she said. A Salvadoran she befriended in a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican town of Tapachula turned out to be a member of the Zeta cartel, she said - an assertion supported by a local press clipping seen by Reuters.
When she tried to escape him, he sent associates to kidnap her from a bus station and hauled her to a house where the gang members made her their sex slave, she said, her voice breaking.
Weeks later, she escaped. But she said she feared the gang's criminal ties in Honduras would put her at risk of being hunted down if she went home. 
So she went north, planning to ask for asylum in the United States. 
""The United States takes better care of people, doesn't it?"" she said.
Keeping accurate figures for the Central Americans who go missing is difficult because migrants are in transit, often illegally, and anyone accompanying them is unlikely to notify authorities, said Barrios, of Justicia Tamaulipas.
Pastor Hector Silva, founder of Senda de Vida, said numerous Central Americans in his shelter had disappeared after venturing out against his advice, the most recent case a few weeks earlier. 
Each time, Silva said, his visitors left their few possessions, as if they meant to return within minutes. 
Sometimes families or friends found the missing migrants and paid a ransom before it was too late, he said. 

In the shadow of the international bridge, with a U.S. flag fluttering just over the river, a cross carved with the words ""Memoria Migrantes"" stands as a bleak memorial to those who were never heard from again.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>",NewsGuard's 'real news' seal of approval helps spark change in fake news era,"By Kenneth Li
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 500 news websites have made changes to their standards or disclosures after getting feedback from NewsGuard, a startup that created a credibility ratings system for news on the internet, the company told Reuters this week. 
The latest major news organization to work with the company is Britain's Daily Mail, according to NewsGuard, which upgraded what it calls its ""nutrition label"" rating on the paper's site to ""green"" on Thursday, indicating it ""generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability.""
A representative of the Daily Mail did not respond to several requests for comment. 
NewsGuard markets itself as an independent arbiter of credible news. It was launched last year by co-chief executives Steven Brill, a veteran U.S. journalist who founded Brill's Content and the American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of News Corp's Wall Street Journal.
NewsGuard joins a handful of other groups such as the Trust Project and the Journalism Trust Initiative which aim to help readers discern which sites are credible when many readers have trouble distinguishing fact from fiction. 
After facing anger over the rapid spread of false news in the past year or so,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other tech companies also say they have recruited more human fact checkers to identify and sift out some types of inaccurate articles.
These efforts were prompted at least in part by the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Facebook and other social media sites were used to disseminate many false news stories.
The company has been criticized by Breitbart News, a politically conservative site, which described NewsGuard as ""the establishment media’s latest effort to blacklist alternative media sites."" 
The way NewsGuard works is this: red or green shield-shaped labels are visible in a web browser window when looking at a news website if a user downloads NewsGuard's software from the web. The software is free and works with the four leading browsers: Google's Chrome, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's Safari. 
'CALL EVERYONE FOR COMMENT' 
NewsGuard's investors include the French advertising company  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) and the non-profit Knight Foundation. Thomas Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, owns a smaller stake, according to NewsGuard's website. News sites do not pay the company for its service.
The startup said it employs 35 journalists who have reviewed and published labels on about 2,200 sites based on nine journalistic criteria such as whether the site presents information responsibly, has a habit of correcting errors, or discloses its ownership and who is in charge of the content. 
News sites field questions if they choose to from NewsGuard journalists about its performance on the nine criteria.
""We call everyone for comment which algorithms don't do,"" Brill said in an interview, highlighting the difference between NewsGuard's verification process with the computer code used by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook in bringing new stories to the attention of users. 
Some news organizations have clarified their ownership, financial backers and identity of their editorial staff after interacting with the company, NewsGuard said.
GateHouse Media, which publishes more than 140 local newspapers such as the Austin American-Statesman and Akron Beacon Journal, made changes to how it identifies sponsored content that may appear to be objective reporting but is actually advertising, after being contacted by NewsGuard.  
""We made our standards and practices more prominent and consistent across our digital 460 news brands across the country,"" said Jeff Moriarty, GateHouse's senior vice president of digital.
Reuters News, which earned a green rating on all nine of NewsGuard's criteria, added the names and titles of its editorial leaders to the Reuters.com website after being contacted by NewsGuard, a Reuters spokesperson said.
NewsGuard upgraded the Daily Mail's website rating on Thursday to green after giving it a red label in August, when it stated that the site ""repeatedly publishes false information and has been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases."" 
The Daily Mail objected to that description, and started discussions with NewsGuard in January after the red label became visible for mobile users of Microsoft's Edge browser, NewsGuard said. 
NewsGuard has made public many details of its exchange with the Daily Mail on its website. 

""We're not in the business of trying to give people red marks,"" Brill said. ""The most common side effect of what we do is for news organizations to improve their journalistic practices.""

442,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>","Building on Syria war gains, Hezbollah scores political win","By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah's bigger role in Lebanon's new unity government points to a growing appetite to shape state affairs and builds on unprecedented military clout the group is wielding after helping turn the tide in Syria's war.
Hezbollah's expanding power in Lebanon reflects a deepening of Iranian influence in an arc of territory from Tehran through Baghdad and Damascus that its foes Saudi Arabia and Israel have struggled to counter. 
Deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, Iran-backed Hezbollah has assumed control of three ministries in the government led by the Western-backed Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, the largest number of portfolios it has ever held. 
The new government was formed on Thursday, ending nine months of wrangling.
The most significant portfolio under Hezbollah control is the Health Ministry, the first time Hezbollah has controlled a ministry with a big budget, though the Shi'ite doctor it picked for the job is not a party member.
More broadly, Hezbollah and its political allies from across Lebanon's sectarian spectrum have emerged with more than half of cabinet's 30 seats, reflecting a May parliamentary election which the group declared a victory.
Salem Zahran, an analyst with links to Hezbollah leaders, said the government would go down in its history as the ""first big shift and the first step along a long road"" towards more influence in government.
""This transformation is because Hezbollah has accumulated an excess of power after it has nearly finished with the military battles in Syria,"" he said. ""I believe that Hezbollah will build up even more involvement in the Lebanese state.""
Hezbollah, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is by far the most powerful group in Lebanon. Its clout in the region has grown since it joined the war in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad.
Lebanese government posts are parcelled out according to a complicated sectarian system, capping how many any one group can hold. The post of prime minister is reserved for a Sunni Muslim, a job Hariri has now held three times because of his status as Lebanon's leading Sunni.
But Hariri's Sunni dominance was shaken by the May election in which he lost more than one third of his seats in parliament, many of them to Hezbollah-allied Sunnis. Hezbollah managed to secure a cabinet seat for one of its Sunni allies.
This is a big gain for Hezbollah and its allies who have long sought to erode the Sunni dominance built by the Hariri family after Lebanon's civil war, with the backing of Riyadh.
As Hezbollah's clout has grown, Saudi Arabia has turned its focus away from Lebanon to other parts of the region, weakening Hezbollah's opponents who had benefited from its backing.
Hariri's ally, the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) party, was forced to cede significant ground during nine months of political wrangling over government portfolios, though it gained seats in parliament.
Hezbollah's biggest Christian ally, President Michel Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, made fewer concessions.
The most significant was giving the ground needed for Hezbollah's Sunni ally to join the cabinet - a point of friction between the allies. But Aoun, who backs Hezbollah's possession of weapons, still controls one third of the cabinet.
""STRATEGIC IMBALANCE""
Nabil Boumonsef, a Hezbollah critic and An-Nahar newspaper columnist, said Hezbollah's role was ""growing very clearly"" and noted that Hariri allies failed to secure all their demands.
""This strategic imbalance confirms that Hezbollah's influence in this government is stronger than in the previous one for sure. This absolutely cannot be denied,"" he said.
This poses questions for the United States, whose Lebanon policy twins military aid to the Lebanese army and support for Hariri with growing pressure on Hezbollah through sanctions.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement it was concerned that Hezbollah would continue to occupy ministerial positions and was allowed to name the health minister.
""We call on the new government to ensure the resources and services of these ministries do not provide support to Hezbollah ... We look to all parties in the new government to uphold Lebanon's policy of disassociation from regional conflicts and its international obligations,"" it said.
The United States has imposed new sanctions on Hezbollah as part of its strategy to counter Iran.
The frontpage headline of the pro-Hezbollah newspaper al-Akhbar said Hezbollah needed ""a government amid the storm"".
""Hezbollah benefits today from the government led by Hariri specifically ... because Hariri, with his Western and Gulf (Arab) facade could be a safety net or helper, keeping options open, when it comes to escalating American sanctions"", al-Akhbar wrote in its main story on the government.
A senior Western diplomat said Hezbollah's opponents would keep a close eye on how Hezbollah manages the Health Ministry. 
""The other parties will closely monitor the funds Hezbollah has in the ministry and will cry foul when something is happening, because they know the Americans are looking in the same direction."" 
The new health minister, Jamil Jabak, has said his priorities include improving government hospitals and bringing down drug prices.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The Islamist militant group Boko Haram killed at least 60 people in the northeast Nigerian town of Rann on Monday, a day after it was abandoned by the military, Amnesty International and security sources said on Friday.
The attack on Rann, home to a camp housing tens of thousands of people displaced by the Islamist insurgency, was one of the group's bloodiest.
It came two weeks after Boko Haram had overrun the same town, driving out Nigerian soldiers and signalling its re-emergence as a force capable of capturing army bases.
The bloodshed is a challenge for President Muhammadu Buhari in particular as he seeks a second successive four-year term in an election on Feb. 16, having been elected in 2015 partly on a promise to restore security.
The military did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.
The two attacks have driven some 40,000 people to flee, 30,000 of them into nearby Cameroon, according to aid agencies.
""This attack on civilians who have already been displaced by the bloody conflict may amount to possible war crimes,"" Osai Ojigho, Amnesty's Nigeria director, said in a statement.
""Witnesses told us that Nigerian soldiers abandoned their posts the day before the attack, demonstrating the authorities' utter failure to protect civilians.""
Two security sources told Reuters that Nigerian troops had returned to Rann along with Cameroonian troops from a multinational task force after the first attack on Jan. 14. 
After the Cameroonians went back across the border, the Nigerian soldiers left because they did not have enough troops, weapons or equipment, the sources said.
The next day, Boko Haram came. The militants set the town ablaze and executed its elders and traditional leaders, leaving one alive as a witness, one of the security sources said.
A video of the attack reviewed by Reuters showed people gathering belongings and fleeing, screaming, as the town burned.
A surge in attacks in the northeast by Boko Haram and its now more powerful offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province is throwing preparations for the presidential election into disarray.
Despite the violence, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday ""the current rate of return of these IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees is encouraging, and this is due to improving security in many areas that were once completely out of bounds"".

Metin Topuz' arrest in October 2017 exacerbated tensions between Washington and Ankara, already strained over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey's plan to buy a Russian defense system, and the U.S. jailing of an executive at a Turkish state bank in an Iran sanctions-busting case.
The Istanbul court ruled to keep Topuz, a translator and fixer for the Drug Enforcement Agency, in detention until trial hearings scheduled for March 26, Anadolu said.
Topuz was arrested over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of a coup attempt in 2016. Gulen denies that.
The indictment seeks life imprisonment for Topuz on charges of ""attempting to overthrow the constitutional order"", spying and ""attempting to remove the government"".
Ankara has repeatedly demanded that Washington extradite Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999.
Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants over suspected coup links, according to the U.N. human rights office.
There was some easing of U.S.-Turkish tensions late last year when a Turkish court freed a U.S. pastor detained for two years over accusations of links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Gulen.
On Wednesday, a Turkish court freed another employee of the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Adana, after it convicted him of membership and support for an armed terrorist organization.
Hamza Ulucay, a translator at the U.S. consulate in Adana, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail, but walked free due to time served.

(Reuters) - On a typical day, Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman would wake at noon and make calls while strolling under the trees in the mountains of his native Sinaloa state, where he was in hiding, a witness recently testified at the kingpin's trial.
The infamous gangster's personal life and business dealings have gone on public display since mid-November at a courthouse in New York, where Guzman faces 10 criminal counts and a possible life sentence. 
The jury will begin deliberations on Monday, after attorneys for the prosecution and defense gave closing statements this week. 
U.S. prosecutors, who say Guzman amassed a $14 billion fortune through bribery, murder and drug smuggling, supported their case by calling to the stand Guzman's former associates, including one who says she was his lover and another whose brother was among his top allies, as well as law enforcement officers.
""Do not let him escape responsibility,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Goldbarg told jurors on Wednesday, standing at a table displaying AK-47 rifles and bricks of cocaine as evidence. 
Defense lawyers claim the 61-year-old Guzman, whose nickname means ""Shorty,"" was set up as a scapegoat. They attacked the credibility of witnesses, many of whom have extensive criminal histories.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments will move to recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president from next week, but using cautious language for fear of setting a precedent for political crises, two EU diplomats said on Friday.
Nervous that Guaido's decision to declare himself president could set an example for other opposition leaders around the world, EU foreign ministers agreed in Bucharest this week to back him only until a new election could be held. 
Instead of the bloc as a whole making a joint declaration, each of the 28 governments will come forward with their own position on whether to back Venezuela's National Assembly head.
Britain, France, Germany and Spain are expected to announce their direct recognition of Guaido from Monday, assuming an eight-day deadline they set last Saturday for an election is not met, diplomats said. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has dismissed the call as an unacceptable ultimatum.
The majority of other, smaller EU countries will throw their support behind Guaido but have agreed to avoid explicitly using the words ""recognition"" and ""recognize"".
According to two documents prepared for EU diplomats and seen by Reuters, they will ""acknowledge support"" for Guaido in his role as interim president.
""A lot of countries will want to stress the interim nature of this de-facto recognition,"" one EU diplomat said.
Despite pressure from the European Parliament, which formally recognized the 35-year-old Venezuelan congress head in a vote on Thursday, and following recognition from the United States, Canada and several Latin American nations, which argue Maduro stole his second-term election, the EU has so far avoided a clear position on Guaido.
The diplomats said EU governments had felt more comfortable in shifting towards support by basing their position on Venezuela's constitution, which states that the head of congress can take over if the president usurps power, is absent or incapacitated.
As Venezuela has sunk into economic and political crisis that has brought mass emigration and hyperinflation, the EU imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on officials to decry what it views as rights violations and the rupture of democracy.
The bloc has agreed to lead an international crisis group of 10 to 12 countries and is expected to hold its first meeting next week in Montevideo, the diplomats said.
According to an EU document agreed by foreign ministers on Thursday, the so-called International Contact Group on Venezuela will seek new elections in Venezuela within 90 days through ""regular, discreet and structured contacts.""

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Thursday governments including Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy would take part in a so-called international contact group, along with Bolivia, Ecuador and other countries.

Ahmed Hamed was among a group of migrants who, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, pelted police with rocks at the border with Serbia before forcing their way into Hungary. Hamed was sentenced to five years in prison.
In 2017, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's cabinet office sent a migration questionnaire to households in which Hamed's case was mentioned and he was described as a convict.
Hamed argued that this was defamatory since his conviction had not become final until 2018.
Budapest judge Lajos Bene said the case was ""unfounded"", not least because Hamed's case had received wide publicity at the time.

Hamed was released from prison last month and is in custody awaiting deportation to a third country. He has resident status in Cyprus.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 10:22AM ET</span>",Brazil's Vale knew of risk to area hit by deadly mine disaster: Folha de S.Paulo,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Vale (SA:VALE3) knew as recently as last year that some of the areas hit by last week's deadly mining disaster were at risk if its tailings dam burst, according to an internal Vale study published by a local newspaper on Friday.
The study seen by newspaper Folha de S.Paulo represents a fresh embarrassment for the world's largest iron ore miner, which has come under intense pressure over the burst tailings dam at its Corrego do Feijao mine last Friday.
With 110 people confirmed dead and another 238 missing, according to a firefighters' count on Thursday evening, the tailings dam collapse in the town of Brumadinho could be Brazil's deadliest mine disaster.
The disaster poses a headache for the new government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whose new business-friendly administration must juggle public anger over the tragedy and its own desire to ease mining and environmental regulations to kick-start growth.
The internal study reported by the paper was dated April 18, 2018, and outlined the likely impact of a collapse at the dam. It found that the mine restaurant, where many Vale workers were likely to have died when the dam collapsed, would be hit by toxic mud. Other areas where people probably died were also at risk, Folha reported. 
The study envisaged that sirens would alert workers if the dam burst, but the company has said that did not happen because the mud flow destroyed them before they could sound the alarm. Two of the Vale officials responsible in case of emergencies were killed by the rupture, Folha said.
The plan also predicted that the mud flow would travel up to 65 km (40 miles) from the dam. 
In a statement, Vale acknowledged the existence of the study and said it was a routine disaster preparation plan required by regulators.
""This plan is built on the basis of technical studies of hypothetical scenarios in the event of a breach,"" it said, without directly referencing Folha's story.
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman has said the miner built its facilities to comply with regulations and that equipment had shown the dam was stable. 
ASSETS FROZEN
In the wake of the disaster, Vale has said it will take up to 10 percent of its production offline and spend 5 billion reais ($1.36 billion) to decommission 10 dams. 
On Thursday state labor courts froze more than 800 million reais ($219 million) of Vale's assets as compensation for victims. That followed court orders over the weekend freezing 11.8 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in assets to cover rescue efforts and damages. The company had about 24 billion reais in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter.
A ministerial task force convened by Bolsonaro began drawing up a unified legislative plan to improve safety, oversight and the licensing of dams.
A person with direct knowledge of the proceedings said the proposals are likely to include executive orders and bills in Congress and take at least seven to 10 days to prepare.
Residents in the devastated town of Brumadinho were still learning of the fallout from the deadly mud flow.
The Minas Gerais state government said on Thursday that initial tests of the Paraopeba River, which was contaminated by the toxic mud, indicated that ""the water poses risks to human and animal health."" It added that locals should not use Paraopeba River water for any purpose.
United Nations human rights experts on Wednesday urged an official investigation of the incident. Federal and state prosecutors have already said they are seeking to make the matter a criminal case.
After a meeting with Brazil's top prosecutor, Vale CEO Schvartsman told journalists that he had no reason to think the company's executives would go to prison.

Schvartsman said the company was focused on paying families as soon as possible and he had also discussed environmental issues with federal prosecutors.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 10:18AM ET</span>",USAID assistance in the West Bank and Gaza has ceased: U.S. official,"By Stephen Farrell and Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has ceased all assistance to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, a U.S. official said on Friday.
The halt was requested by the Palestinian Authority but is certain to bring further hardship to people in the already deprived territories. 
The deadline also sees the end of about $60 million in U.S. aid for the Palestinian security forces, whose cooperation with Israeli forces helps maintain relative quiet in the West Bank. 
The decision was linked to a Jan. 31 deadline set by new U.S. legislation under which foreign aid recipients would be more exposed to anti-terrorism lawsuits. 
The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA) empowers Americans to sue foreign aid recipients in U.S. courts over alleged complicity in ""acts of war"".
The Palestinian Authority declined further U.S. funding over worries about its potential legal exposure, although it denies Israeli accusations that it encourages militant attacks.
""At the request of the Palestinian Authority, we have wound down certain projects and programs funded with assistance under the authorities specified in ATCA in the West Bank and Gaza, a U.S. official told Reuters on Friday.
""All USAID assistance in the West Bank and Gaza has ceased.""
It was unclear how long the cessation would last. The official said no steps were currently being taken to close the USAID mission in the Palestinian territories, and no decision had been made about future staffing at the USAID mission in the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.
USAID is the main agency administering U.S. foreign assistance in the Palestinian territories. According to its website, the agency spent $268 million on public projects in the West Bank and Gaza as well as Palestinian private sector debt repayment in 2017, but there were significant cuts to all new funding through the end of June 2018.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""The suspension of aid to our people, which included critical sectors such as health and education, will have a negative impact on all, create a negative atmosphere, and increase instability.""
The Palestinian Authority is an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo peace accords. The peace process, aimed at finding a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, has been stalled since 2014.
In the Hamas-ruled enclave of Gaza, Hamas spokesman Ismail Rudwan condemned the cuts, deploring what he called ""politicised money"".
HUMANITARIAN CUTS
The announcement comes after humanitarian officials in the West Bank and Gaza said they were already facing a cutback from donors worldwide.
Last year Washington cut hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the Palestinians, which included funding to humanitarian groups supported by USAID.
The U.S. cuts were widely seen as a means of pressuring the Palestinian leadership to resume the peace talks with Israel and to engage with the Trump administration ahead of its long-awaited Middle East peace plan.
As a result, dozens of NGO employees have been laid off, programmes shut down, and infrastructure projects halted.
In Gaza, Mohammad Ashour said he once earned $600 a month providing psychological support to people with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer.
The project was run by the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution. But, said Ashour, he lost his job last summer because the program was funded with the help of USAID money.
""I have no clue how am I going to pursue my life,"" said Ashour, from Bureij refugee camp.
""I have no job and I am in debt, maybe tomorrow the police will come and take me to jail. An educated man ends in jail, I am wrecked.""
In August, Washington announced an end to all U.S. funding for the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees. The agency received $364 million from the United States in 2017.
In January the World Food Programme cut food aid to about 190,000 Palestinians due to a shortage of funds.
Diplomatic sources said Palestinian, U.S. and Israeli officials were trying to find ways to keep the money flowing to Abbas's security forces. 
""We will find a solution to these things. I won't get into details,"" Israeli security cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz told Israel Radio on Thursday.
USAID will continue to implement conflict management and mitigation grants in Israel, with Jewish and Arab participants, the official said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel took another step in her stage-managed exit from politics on Friday, posting a video to announce the closure of her Facebook (O:FB) page after stepping down as head of her party.
Merkel, chancellor of Europe's largest economy since 2005, decided last year after a series of election setbacks to relinquish leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and not run for another term.
In the video, Merkel thanked her 2.5 million followers and invited them to continue following her via the government's official Facebook page or on Instagram, which shares pictures. 
""Today is the day on which I would like to thank you for all your support of my Facebook page,"" she said. ""You know that I am no longer CDU president, so I will now close my Facebook page.""
For a public figure to close down a social media presence with such a large following is an unusual move, leading some to speculate that, whatever else Merkel plans for her post-chancellor life, she envisages doing so as a private citizen.
Her 13-year dominance of European politics has made her retirement a guessing game, with some expecting her to take up a senior role in the European Union or the United Nations.
Merkel has always deflected questions over her future.
Building a large social media following to serve as a valuable communications channel is arduous work. 
Merkel's following is ahead of her friend and ally French President Emmanuel Macron's 2.3 million followers, and dwarfs Britain's Theresa May's 503,000.
The move could not contrast more sharply with Donald Trump, who is Merkel's opposite in some respects and whose quick-fire tweets defined both his campaign and his presidency. 
Merkel's page often went days without an update.
Her farewell video was flooded with hundreds of comments in many languages within minutes of going online.
Many of them referenced the 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of Syrian war refugees - a move that came to define her chancellorship.
""I don't support you! What you did and do in Europe and with your people is shameful,"" wrote Maria Balogh in Hungarian.

""You were my candidate for president,"" wrote Martha Reardon Berwick in English. ""I only wish you were here in the US!""

Friends of the Thuringian Sausage, an association that runs a museum in honor of the delicacy named after the region, want to move to a new building to be located on land where the Nazis held prisoners in a so-called subcamp in World War Two.
""We are shocked and irritated by the total lack of sensitivity,"" said Reinhard Schramm, head of the Jewish community in Thuringia, home to some 800 Jews.
""We are in talks with city officials and hope we can find a solution that honors the victims.""
The site of the former subcamp lies on the outskirts of the city of Muehlhausen, some 80 km northwest of Buchenwald, on a patch of land that a private investor bought from the government in 2008.
The investor now wants to build a theater, a hotel and a building to house the new sausage museum - a project that has received the backing of the city.
The Muehlhausen city council held a meeting on Thursday attended by representatives of the Jewish community to find a solution, Schramm said.
One idea being considered is to ensure that the new project includes some kind of memorial to the victims of the Nazis.
A spokesman for the First German Sausage Museum, currently located in Holzhausen, 60 km south of Muehlhausen, did not respond to an email asking for comment.
The museum announced on Wednesday its plans to move to Muehlhausen, saying the new site would give it more seating capacity and allow it to include new attractions.
Thuringian sausages, usually made with pork mince, caraway, marjoram, and garlic, are one of the most famous of the more than 1,500 sausage varieties made in Germany.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese police fired tear gas on Friday at hundreds of protesters in Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, witnesses said, in the latest of more than a month of anti-government demonstrations.
Demonstrators frustrated with a worsening economic crisis have been on the streets near-daily since Dec. 19 calling for an end to the 30-year rule of President Omar al-Bashir.
The protesters, who began demonstrating after weekly Muslim prayers, chanted: ""Down, that's it"", which has become the main rallying cry for Bashir's fall. 
They also chanted: ""Freedom, peace, justice"" and ""Revolution is the people's choice"", witnesses said.
Security forces have at times used live ammunition to disperse protesters. Rights groups say at least 45 people have been killed in more than six weeks of protests. The government puts the death toll at 30, including two security personnel.
The protests in December began in the city of Atbara, where hundreds protested against price rises and torched the local headquarters of Bashir's ruling National Congress Party. They have since swelled to become the most sustained street opposition Bashir has faced in power.
Striking a defiant tone on Thursday, Bashir told supporters in the provincial capital of Kassala: ""Changing the government and changing the president will not be through WhatsApp nor Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but will be through the ballot box.""

BARCELONA, Spain (Reuters) - Jailed Catalan politician Raul Romeva hopes the upcoming trial of separatist leaders at the Supreme Court in Madrid will refocus attention on the region's push for independence from Spain.
The trial of Romeva and 11 others should start next Thursday or on Feb. 12. He was one of nine jailed without bail in late 2017 and early 2018 who were transferred on Friday from prisons outside Barcelona to facilities near Madrid. 
Spain's public prosecutor is seeking prison terms of up to 25 years for them on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds for their role in Catalonia's failed secession bid from Spain in 2017.
""We've sought to be heard for a long while, but they silenced our voices and image with jail,"" Romeva, 47, told Reuters in an interview conducted in a written question and answer format just before the transfer to Madrid.
""We see the trial as an opportunity to address public opinion and society in Catalonia, Spain and obviously at an international level,"" he wrote.
He and his co-defendants are accused of ""crimes that European courts deny and that we have not committed,"" he said.
""That is why the only possible sentence is acquittal. A (condemnation) sentence will always weigh on history and on Spain's future.""
Romeva was in charge of foreign relations in the regional government led by Carles Puigdemont in 2017 when Catalonia unilaterally proclaimed independence after a referendum that was deemed unconstitutional by Madrid.
Before that, he led a coalition of pro-independence parties in the 2015 Catalan elections and was also a member of the European Parliament.
The events brought Spain to one of its worst political crises since the end of the Franco dictatorship and the return of democracy four decades ago. The central government briefly took direct control of the region and rounded up prominent separatist leaders.
Romeva said he respected the decision by Puigdemont and some of his former government colleagues to flee Spain to avoid arrest. Puigdemont is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, a socialist who came to power last June and needs the support of Catalan nationalists to pass laws, favors the path of dialogue to give Catalonia more autonomy but has ruled out any moves toward independence. 
Romeva urged Sanchez to be brave in addressing the issue and make a viable offer to the Catalan parties if he wants their support to his budget proposal facing its first vote next month.
He does not regret Catalan government actions and said that Spain would eventually have to come to terms with reality.

""Holding a referendum is not a crime. ..Denying reality will never fix anything,"" he said. ""We've always sought and offered dialogue, and the answer has always been denial and repression,"" he said.

A 2,400-tonne boring machine is working around the clock more than 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) below ground on the French side of the border, even as Rome threatens to pull the plug as it reviews the 8.6 billion euro ($10 billion) project.
The two countries agreed in December to freeze new contracts on the 36-mile (58 km) tunnel until completion of an Italian cost-benefit analysis.
""Naturally, we respect the decision-making process in Italy while also making it known that there are timelines,"" French Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne told reporters on a site visit. ""And so decisions need to be made quickly.""
If the project were to collapse it would risk souring relations that have come under increasing strain in past weeks as Italy's anti-establishment leaders goad europhile French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of European elections in May.
The tunnel project is financed by France, Italy and the European Union and has previously emphasized the ""geostrategic"" importance of the tunnel.
Italian coalition party 5-Star argues it is a huge waste of public money that would be better spent on Italy's existing crumbling infrastructure. Its partner in government, the right-wing League party, says it would cost the economy more not to build the tunnel in lost economic opportunities than to do it.

The Supreme Court's attorney-general Paul Vlas said a Dutch appeals court in 2017 had made an ""incomprehensible"" decision by upholding a verdict that Dutch peacekeepers had not done enough to protect the men seeking refuge at their U.N. base.
His opinion will be taken into account when the court makes its final ruling, expected on April 19.
Altogether 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb troops under the command of General Ratko Mladic in Srebrenica in July 1995, the worst mass killing on European soil since World War Two.
Many of the victims had fled to the U.N.-declared ""safe zone"" in Srebrenica, only to find the outnumbered Dutch troops there unable to defend them.
The Dutch government resigned in 2002 after acknowledging its failure to protect the refugees, but said the peacekeepers had been on 'mission impossible'.
The original verdict in 2014 ruled that Dutch soldiers should have known the men would be murdered by Bosnian Serb troops if they were forced to leave the base.
The Dutch state had asked the Supreme Court to overturn the 2017 ruling, which it can only do if it finds the lower court erred in law or procedure.
Vlas said the decision by the appeals court had ignored the threat of war facing the lightly-armed Dutchbat troops and the uncertain fate of the men if they had been allowed to stay on the base while supply lines were cut and the Dutch forced to leave at any moment.
""It would have been different if Dutchbat had known, or should have known, the men were facing certain death, or inhumane treatment"", he said. ""But that was not the case.""
The appeals court in 2017 said the Netherlands should pay 30 percent of damages to relatives of the victims.
Mladic was convicted of war crimes and genocide and sentenced to life in prison by a U.N. court in November 2017.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 08:12AM ET</span>",EU irks Britain by calling Gibraltar a 'colony',"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain complained about the European Union calling Gibraltar a ""colony"" in a piece of draft legislation on Friday, highlighting how the EU is lining up behind Spain in its territorial dispute as Britain quits the bloc.
The 27 remaining member states agreed to offer Britons visa-free travel to the EU after Brexit in March, even if talks on a broader withdrawal treaty collapse, on condition that Britain offers the same terms to EU citizens visiting for up to 90 days.
But diplomats said Britain's ambassador to the EU had objected to the wording of the text; it placed the 33,000 people of Gibraltar in a different category from UK citizens -- with the same travel rights -- and it also spelled out Spain's claim to sovereignty over ""The Rock"" at the United Nations.
In particular, it stated: ""Gibraltar is a colony of the British Crown. There is a controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over Gibraltar.""
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman insisted Gibraltar was not a ""colony"". The port at the mouth of the Mediterranean, ceded to Britain by Spain in 1713 after a war, was a ""crown colony"" when Britain joined the European bloc in 1973 but London reclassified it as a ""British overseas territory"" in 2002.
""Gibraltar is not a colony and it is completely inappropriate to describe in this way,"" a British spokeswoman said. ""Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family.""
The wording has, however, been used in other EU texts. Finding in Britain's favour against Spain in a case in 2006, the European Court of Justice stated: ""Gibraltar is currently a British Crown Colony. It does not form part of the United Kingdom.""
""DECOLONISATION""
Spain's claim to sovereignty makes use of U.N. rules on decolonisation. Those, among other things, limit the weight given to the preferences of people living in a territory; Gibraltarians favour remaining British, despite having voted overwhelming against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. 
The text agreed by the 27 governments will be discussed by the European Parliament and the EU executive in order to finalise a regulation giving Britons visa-free access.
Recalling how EU policy on Gibraltar had so far largely favoured Britain, which joined the bloc before Spain, a senior EU official told Reuters recently: ""Now the table has turned.
""The Union position ... was the British position ... But with Brexit, the Union position is now the Spanish position. We will always take the side of a member against a non-member.""
Spain has already secured a right of veto over whether future Brexit arrangements can apply to Gibraltar. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez held up an agreement on the current withdrawal treaty in November over the issue and said Spain would seek joint sovereignty after Britain leaves the EU. 
Spanish sources said this week that Madrid would insist on excluding Gibraltar from all agreements between Britain and the EU once Britain has left.

There is, however, concern among other EU members that Madrid's hard line could disrupt efforts to ease Britain out of the bloc. EU diplomats point to the territorial issue as one of those that could fray the unity the 27 have shown in negotiations up to now.

VATICAN CITY/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Pope Francis is hoping to persuade a country enmeshed in a regional war that he has condemned to give Catholics more freedom when he becomes the first pontiff to set foot on the Arabian Peninsula. 
Francis will spend less than 48 hours in the United Arab Emirates, which is fighting alongside Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war, and is due to make only two public addresses during the trip that starts on Sunday night.
Although short, the visit to the peninsula, home to two million expatriate Catholics as well as the holiest sites of Islam in Saudi Arabia, is a landmark one. The freedom to practice Christianity — or any religion other than Islam — varies across Gulf countries. 
The papal Mass in Abu Dhabi's Zayed Sports City on Tuesday, is expected to draw some 120,000 people. 
""I am happy for this occasion the Lord has given me to write, on your dear land, a new page in the history of relations between religions,"" Francis said in a video message on Thursday. It started in Arabic with the words Al Salamu Alaikum (Peace be with you).
""Faith in God unites and does not divide, it draws us closer despite differences, it distances us from hostilities and aversion.""
Priests, worshippers and diplomats in the UAE say it is among the most tolerant countries in the Gulf region toward other religions.
In the UAE and Kuwait, Christians may worship in churches or church compounds, and in other places with special licenses. In Saudi Arabia, churches are banned. 
Francis praised the UAE as ""a land that is trying to be a model of coexistence, of human brotherhood, and a meeting place among diverse civilizations and cultures.""
YEMEN SHADOW
He has already visited half a dozen predominantly Muslim nations and has used those trips to call for inter-religious dialogue and to condemn the notion of violence in the name of God. In March, he will go to Morocco.
The war in Yemen, which the pope has condemned several times, could cast a shadow on the trip.
Last June, he said he was following the ""dramatic fate of the people of Yemen, already exhausted by years of conflict"" and appealed to the international community to seek negotiations ""to avoid a worsening of the already tragic humanitarian situation"".
The UAE has played a leading role in the Saudi-led coalition waging a nearly four-year war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen.
Rights groups have accused UAE-backed forces of torturing detainees in areas under their control in Yemen, charges the UAE has denied. The UAE says it has never run prisons or secret detention centers in Yemen and that prisons there are under the authority of the Yemeni government. Its Yemeni allies have denied allegations of torturing prisoners.
""I don't think the pope will be silent about what is happening in the region,"" Bishop Paul Hinder, the Abu Dhabi-based Apostolic Vicar for Southern (NYSE:SO) Arabia, said in an interview when asked if the pope would speak about the war.
But he said he did not know if the pope would mention it in public or in private meetings with UAE leaders.
The pope will meet privately with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, who invited him.
""There may very well be some people who will criticize him for going (because of the war in Yemen) but I expect that he will raise this issue as he has previously,"" a Western diplomat said. 
""PASSPORT CHURCHES""
Francis will also visit Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the largest in the country, and hold a private meeting there with the Muslim Council of Elders.
Vatican officials call Catholic communities such as those in the UAE ""passport Churches"" because the priests, like the mostly Filippino and Indian Catholics they minister to, are foreign and need permission to live and work there.
This is different from other mostly Muslim countries like Syria and Iraq, where there have been local Catholic communities and priests for centuries.
Vatican officials say they hope one of the immediate effects of the visit will be permission to build more church compounds in the UAE to minister to the Catholic community.

""We are really stretched. We need more churches. We need more priests,"" one official said.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Hungary opposition unites in challenge to government's overhaul of courts,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's often-divided opposition parties came together on Friday to urge the country's top court to investigate an overhaul of the justice system, which they say could make it vulnerable to government influence.
The rare unified political front against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government was forged by concerns about new administrative courts which, from January 2020, will hear cases about government business such as taxation and elections. 
The justice minister will oversee its appointments and budget, which the opposition says is a conflict of interest.
Orban, whose Fidesz party came to power in 2010, has used a two-thirds majority in Parliament to solidify his power and erode democratic checks and balances with scant resistance from the opposition, which has mostly been weak and mired in infighting.
""The new law violates the principle of separation of powers,"" five parliamentary opposition parties and several other MPs and politicians wrote in a joint press release, adding they would ask the Constitutional Court for a review.
Justice Minister Laszlo Trocsanyi has rejected concerns that the government would pack the new court with judges loyal to Orban's government. 
The government has said the courts would be independent and more efficient than generalist courts that currently handle state matters.
The Constitutional Court can theoretically veto the law or force Parliament to reconsider, but the body has rarely presented a real obstacle to lawmaking. Government spokesmen did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The court reforms helped ignite a string of street protests in Hungary late last year, with new rules expanding private sector overtime also provoking opposition grievances.
The protests have died down but brought opposition political parties together, prompting speculation about coordinated campaign efforts in European Parliament elections and a municipal vote due later this year.
Although several parties ultimately said they would go it alone for the European election campaign, the joint courts challenge shows the opposition cooperation continues in other areas.
""It is an important issue whether citizens can turn to an independent court when they want to enforce their rights against a state administrative body,"" the opposition group wrote.
""The independence of courts means nothing but a chance to win against the state, an opportunity to take up a fight against the tyranny of those in power."" 

In September the European Parliament voted to impose sanctions on Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption. Hungary rejected the accusations.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 07:33AM ET</span>","Forty years since revolution, Iran taunts 'declining' America","DUBAI (Reuters) - Forty years after its revolution, Iran has no fear of a ""declining"" America, a senior cleric said on Friday at the start of official commemorations of the uprising that made the country a permanent enemy of the United States.
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a famously hardline cleric who is the secretary of the Guardian Council, a body with huge influence over the way Iran is run, used his speech to mock the leadership of President Donald Trump.
""Even many of America's allies don't listen to it anymore and they are not afraid of it,"" Jannati said at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who returned from exile in France to lead the revolution exactly 40 years ago.
""America cannot manage its own affairs now,"" Jannati said in remarks carried by state television, adding that ""millions of people are hungry there and America's power is in decline."" He did not say what he was basing that assertion on.
The 1979 uprising deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a secular king allied to the West. Later that year, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy and held 52 Americans for 444 days - an affront to U.S. pride that still colors how Iran is viewed from Washington.
Trump last year pulled out of an international agreement under which Iran curbed its nuclear work in exchange for a sanctions relief. The re-imposed sanctions caused a currency crash, rampant inflation and added to investors' hesitancy about doing business there.
Jannati, who opposed President Hassan Rouhani's decision to negotiate away some of Iran's nuclear rights, said:
""Unfortunately, some of our officials believe that we cannot manage the country without America's help. May such wrong thoughts be damned!""
Among many programs on state TV featuring achievements since the revolution, was a short animation showing an Iranian-made Ghadir navy submarine surfacing near a U.S. aircraft carrier and other vessels which then inexplicably sink without any sign of an attack or explosion.

In December, the USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf, ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers.

The Netherlands expects to incur 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in direct costs by 2023 if, as seems possible, Britain leaves the EU next month with no transition agreement to soften the shock and smooth trade.
The bulk of 143 new food inspectorate employees are from southern and eastern Europe due to a shortage of Dutch candidates, said Paula de Jonge, spokeswoman for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority. 
Not all will be ready to go to work in April because they need to complete three six-week Dutch language courses in addition to regular job training, De Jonge said.
Roughly 100 are veterinarians being hired to handle livestock inspections after Britain leaves the EU and its huge single market on March 29. The Dutch imported 237 million euros of British meat in 2017.
""Britain will be considered an outside country requiring more stringent checks than goods coming from member states which do not need additional certification,"" De Jonge said.
About 35,000 Dutch companies have no experience in customs procedures, while just 18 percent of businesses said in a recent government poll they are ready for Brexit.

Nearly 950 customs officials are being hired in the Netherlands to handle the extra work arising from Brexit, most of them to work at the port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest.

Forty-five 45 percent of Russians now believe the country is ""on the wrong course"", compared with 42 percent who approve of the country's direction, according to the poll by the independent Moscow-based Levada Centre, which was published late on Thursday.
Those poll results marked a sharp change from a year ago, when only 28 percent said the country was moving in the wrong direction and 55 percent approved. 
The findings do not pose an immediate risk for President Vladimir Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for 19 years and whose overall approval rating remains over 60 percent.
But they raise questions about how the Kremlin may seek to reverse what both independent and state pollsters have shown is a slide in his ratings since he won re-election last year. 
Last month, a state pollster said the public's trust in Putin had fallen to its lowest level in 13 years amid dismay over falling household incomes and unpopular government moves to raise the retirement age and the value added tax.

The ICO said Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance were closely linked, and systems for segregating the personal data of insurance customers and political subscribers were ineffective.
Eldon Insurance also carried out two unlawful direct marketing campaigns, which involved sending more than 1 million emails to Leave.EU subscribers without sufficient consent, the ICO said. 
""It is deeply concerning that sensitive personal data gathered for political purposes was later used for insurance purposes; and vice versa,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. ""It should never have happened.""

Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said his team was still examining the case materials and intended to make a decision as soon as possible.
Netanyahu is facing possible charges in three graft cases. He denies any wrongdoing and has called the cases a witch-hunt.
He is still the favorite to win the election but opinion polls show one of his toughest challengers, former general Benny Gantz, making gains.
Mandelblit said he had informed Netanyahu's lawyers ""there is no impediment to making and publishing a decision, if there is any, to consider filing an indictment in the cases relating to the prime minister, or part of them, subject to a hearing, even before the election date.""
Netanyahu has said he would not bow out of the race if Mandelbit announces his intention to accept police recommendations to indict him.
Police say Netanyahu granted regulatory favors to leading telecommunications company Bezeq Telecom Israel in return for more positive coverage on a news website belonging to the firm’s owner.

In a second case, police contend that Netanyahu received expensive gifts from rich friends. A third investigation focuses on suspicions that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with one newspaper for better coverage in return for promises to back legislation that would have limited the circulation of a rival.

YANGON (Reuters) - Lawyers for two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar for breaking a colonial-era official secrets law appealed to the Supreme Court on Friday against their conviction, as a rights group said the government wielded repressive laws against peaceful critics.
The appeal, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime, came as New York-based Human Rights Watch said Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's government had dashed hopes for Myanmar's first democratic leader in decades to protect free speech. 
""Our petition asks the Supreme Court to finally provide justice to Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, reverse the lower courts' errors, and order the release of our journalists,"" Reuters said in a statement.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were jailed for seven years after being convicted in September in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress toward democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Also on Friday, Myanmar released from prison a policeman who told a court last year how officers had planted secret documents on the two reporters in order to ""entrap"" them.
The policeman, Moe Yan Naing, criticized the law under which he was punished.
""This police disciplinary law is one of the laws we must amend while we are marching on the path toward democracy,"" Moe Yan Naing, said on his release after serving about nine months of a one-year jail sentence for violating police discipline. 
""This law can cause police much suffering because it is outdated,"" he told reporters outside Insein prison, on the outskirts of the commercial capital, Yangon.
Asked how he felt about the people who ordered his arrest, he said he would console himself through religion.
""I am a Buddhist, I can find peace with that through our Buddhist way,"" he said, and that he felt ""sorry"" for the two reporters still behind bars.
'CLIMATE OF FEAR'
Human Rights Watch said in a report freedom of expression had been deteriorating since Suu Kyi's administration came to power in 2016, with prosecutions creating a ""climate of fear"" among journalists.
""Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy promised a new Myanmar but the government still prosecutes peaceful speech and protests and has failed to revise old oppressive laws,"" the report's author, Linda Lakhdhir, said in a statement.
The report quoted figures from Myanmar free-speech group Athan showing that prosecution for peaceful speech featured in at least half of about 140 cases filed since 2016 under the Telecommunications Act, which prescribes up to two years in jail for anyone who ""defames"" someone using a telecoms network.
""Aung San Suu Kyi's government has had a real opportunity to abolish the tools of oppression used by the military juntas, but has instead used them against peaceful critics and protesters,"" Lakhdhir said.
In September, Suu Kyi said the jailing of the Reuters reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The week after their conviction, she said they were sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists"".
Reuters could not immediately reach government spokesman Zaw Htay for comment.
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar's Rakhine State during an army crackdown that began in August 2017.
The operation sent more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, according to U.N. estimates.
'FAILING A BASIC TEST'
Last month, the high court rejected an initial appeal against the reporters' convictions, saying they had behaved in a way that showed they intended to harm the country.
In response to that ruling, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the decision was deeply troubling and showed Myanmar's courts ""failing a basic test in democracy"".
In their initial appeal, defense lawyers asserted the lower court that tried the case had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the defendants.
The defense also said prosecutors had failed to prove the reporters gathered and collected secret information, sent information to an enemy or intended to harm national security.
At the time of the reporters' trial, Moe Yan Naing, a police captain, gave details of the hours prior to their Dec. 12, 2017, arrest and said police had arranged a ""set-up"".
Shortly after his court appearance in April, Moe Yan Naing was sentenced to prison for violating the Police Disciplinary Act by having previously spoken to Wa Lone. His family was also evicted from police housing in the capital, Naypyitaw.
At the time, police spokesman Colonel Myo Thu Soe told Reuters Moe Yan Naing had been punished ""according to the police disciplinary act"".

Police said the eviction order was not related to Moe Yan Naing's testimony at the reporters' trial.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A constitutional law textbook written by one China's best-known reform-minded legal scholars has been pulled from book shops, apparently the latest text to run afoul of a government campaign against ""Western influence"".
The author, Zhang Qianfan, a professor at Peking University known for his advocacy of constitutionalism and judicial reform, dismissed any suggestion his writing excessively promoted Western ideas as ""utter nonsense"", and said the academic world should not be politicized.
Since taking office in 2012, President Xi Jinping has tightened the Communist Party's control over society including the legal system and education.
While authorities have not confirmed they ordered the book withdrawn, and no reason for its disappearance has been given, it comes after the government launched a sweeping review of teaching materials.
The Ministry of Education in early January launched a nationwide check on the content of all university constitutional law textbooks, according to posts on the Jiangxi and Zhejiang province Education Ministry websites.
Universities were told the ""fact-finding"" sweep was of great importance and they must accurately fill in a chart detailing titles and authors of the books they used, with ""no omissions"", according to the ministry's posts.
The campaign drew criticism from some legal academics, which was amplified by a rumor that the sweep was sparked by an accusation by a professor that certain texts were ""promoting Western thinking and agitating for a Western system"".
The Education Ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
China's constitution promises freedom of speech, religion and assembly, but it is trumped in practice by legislation and regulations, and it is rarely invoked in legal cases.
The constitution has long been a focus for political reformers, who argue that its status should be elevated within the legal system.
Zhang's book could not be found on China's main online bookstores when searched by Reuters on Friday.
'EVERYONE IS SCARED'
Zhang, in an interview published on the WeChat social media platform, rejected any suggestion his texts promoted a ""Western"" system over alternatives.
""To criticize purely for the sake of it and to shut our nation off to the outside world is closed-minded thinking,"" Zhang said.
""Constitutional law, as an academic discipline, should not be politicized,"" he said. ""Any academic discipline should retain a certain political neutrality.""
""At this time, constitutional law is a 'sensitive' topic. As far as I can see there is basically no public discussion. It seems that everyone is scared,"" he said.
Zhang's interview disappeared soon after it was posted, to be replaced by a notice saying the content had broken ""relevant laws and regulations"".
Zhang did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
Many legal scholars took to social media to voice support for Zhang. 
Some posted the foreword from his book, in which he stresses the importance of giving people who have suffered injustices the chance to defend themselves using the constitution.
Some voiced concern that some academics might accuse others of failing to toe the party line.

""The worst part about this incident is that in the current environment, not only are these people not inhibited, but rather they are given a channel, or even rewards,"" Zhang Taisu, an associate professor of law at Yale University in the United States, wrote on Weibo, referring to the accusers.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 02:46AM ET</span>",Venezuela's Guaido courts Russia; powers divided on Maduro,"By Mayela Armas and Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - Global jostling intensified on Thursday between countries that want Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in power and those trying to force him to resign, as opposition leader Juan Guaido made overtures to his rival's allies Russia and China.
Guaido told Reuters he had sent communications to both powers, which are Venezuela's top foreign creditors and support Maduro in the U.N. Security Council despite worries about the cash-strapped country's ability to pay.
The 35-year-old leader argued that Russia and China's interests would be best served by switching the side they back in Venezuela, an OPEC member which has the world's largest oil reserves but is in dire financial straits. 
""What most suits Russia and China is the country's stability and a change of government,"" Guaido said. ""Maduro does not protect Venezuela, he doesn't protect anyone's investments, and he is not a good deal for those countries.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, asked if China had been in touch with Guaido, said they were ""maintaining close communication with all parties through various means regarding the situation in Venezuela.""
China's cooperation with Venezuela was based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit and joint development, he told reporters in Beijing. 
""We believe that no matter how the situation develops or changes, cooperation between China and Venezuela will not be damaged."" 
The intense pressure is led by the United States, which along with most other countries in the Western Hemisphere recognizes Guaido as the country's legitimate interim president, arguing that Maduro stole his second-term election. 
The United States on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm, aimed at pressuring Maduro to step down.
A former union leader, bus driver and foreign minister, the 56-year-old Maduro, who first took office in 2013, has faced waves of protests in recent years as he presided over hyperinflation and chronic food shortages. 
Some 3 million Venezuelans have left the country. A U.N. expert on Thursday warned that the U.S. oil sanctions could worsen the humanitarian crisis. 
With Venezuela in deep economic crisis, the geopolitical tussling has also drawn in Europe and Latin American nations as well as parts of the Middle East.
The U.S. government warned Russia and other countries from ""last-minute looting"" of oil and gold on Thursday, after Reuters reported Venezuela was planning to sell gold from its central bank vaults to the United Arab Emirates in coming days in return for euros in cash, citing a senior source. 
Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio sent a tweet to the United Arab Emirates embassy in Washington on Thursday warning that anybody transporting Venezuelan gold would be subject to U.S. sanctions.
The United States is also monitoring trade between its NATO ally Turkey and Venezuela and will take action if it judges any sanctions have been violated, a senior U.S. official said in Istanbul.
Turkey’s president, Tayyip Erdogan, has stood by Maduro, calling him last week to express support.
CRACKING DOWN? 
Guaido said on Thursday that agents from a feared special police unit had called at his home and asked for his wife, who was at home with their 20-month-old daughter while he was out at an event.
""Such acts of intimidation are seen as very serious, very egregious by the United States,"" a senior U.S. administration official told reporters on a conference call. ""There will be consequences for those engaged in such acts."" 
Guaido appeared at his building with his wife and daughter, saying, ""They will not intimidate this family."" Neighbors said men who identified themselves as belonging to the Special Actions Forces arrived at the gate of Guaido's apartment building in a white SUV. There was no obvious police presence by the time journalists arrived at Guaido's house.
Maduro, who says he will remain for his second six-year term, has accused the opposition of attempting a U.S.-backed coup.
Venezuela's interior minister, Nestor Reverol, said on Thursday that security forces captured five men including a retired army colonel and other army officers on accusations of plotting a coup. 
The men were captured over the last few days, Reverol said. He said they had with them two AK-47 rifles, two satellite phones and 500 bracelets bearing the symbol of Operation Constitution, a political group dedicated to toppling Maduro. 
The government accuses one of the leaders of the group, retired Colonel Oswaldo García Palomo, of participating in an apparent attack at a Maduro event last yet. Garcia Palomo was among the captured men. 
Maduro frequently accuses the opposition, Colombia and the United States of backing coups or assassination attempts. Such claims have usually been dismissed as a smokescreen to distract from problems at home, but a drone exploded at a Maduro event last year, in an apparent attack. 
Maduro also says the opposition strategy of trying to push him from office is illegal and led by hawks in the Trump administration, such as the recently appointed U.S. special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, a veteran diplomat involved in the armed interventions in Central America in the 1980s.
OIL TROUBLE
A United Nations human rights expert denounced the U.S. oil sanctions imposed on Monday, saying they would compound a grave humanitarian crisis.
""Coercion, whether military or economic, must never be used to seek a change in government in a sovereign state,"" said Idriss Jazairy, a U.N. special rapporteur studying the negative impact of sanctions.
""The use of sanctions by outside powers to overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law,"" he said in a statement in Geneva.
In the tussle over oil, Guaido worked this week with Washington to wrest control of PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary Citgo from its board. Citgo and Maduro's government responded by ordering dozens of Citgo's expatriate staff in the United States to return to Caracas by the end of February, people familiar with the matter said.

PDVSA has said it will pursue legal efforts to block a Citgo takeover.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean protesters marched alongside the coffin of a 'comfort women' campaigner to the Japanese embassy on Friday in a protest over Japan's use of forced labor in its wartime brothels.
A hearse carried the casket of Kim Bok-dong, who died this week at 93, to the embassy to highlight the plight of ""comfort women,"" a Japanese euphemism for women who were forced into prostitution and sexually abused at Japanese military brothels before and during World War Two.
""Japan must apologize,"" some of the protesters chanted during the march. ""Japan provide formal compensation."" 
Mourners carried banners thanking Kim for her devotion to the cause and called on Japan to atone for its actions. Some signs were in the shape of butterflies, a symbol of freedom for suffering women. 
The ""comfort women"" are a contentious issue between the two Asian neighbors which share a bitter history stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula.
Japan says the claims have been settled by past agreements and apologies, and that the continued dispute may threaten relations between the two countries.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo on Friday that it would be a problem if the event caused a ""public disturbance"" at the embassy or ""infringement on its dignity."" 
""DIGNIFIED""
Kim, who died in hospital after battling cancer, was one of the first victims to come forward in 1992 and became a fixture at weekly protests outside the Japanese embassy.
Kim said she was 14 when first sent to a military brothel, and forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers also in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore for eight years.
Never married, she dedicated her life to advocacy and traveled the world to tell her story.
""I first met her during a protest in 2012 and she was sitting up straight even in the rain as she spoke about her struggle,"" said Kim Sam, a 27-year-old student campaigner. 
""Upright, dignified - that's how she always was, first as a victim and later as a human rights activist. She's a role model I respect the most."" 
Lee Yong-soo, a fellow victim who paid her respects despite the cold weather, laid flowers at a bronze statue of a girl erected near the Japanese embassy to represent the women. 
Many mourners quietly sobbed and wiped their eyes as organizers aired a video clip in which Kim shouted during a rally that she would raise similar girl statues around the world until Tokyo sincerely apologized. 
Kim was a vocal critic of a 2015 deal in which Tokyo apologized to the victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9.2 million) to a fund in Seoul to help them.
She said the apology was not sincere because some Japanese leaders continued to deny the women were forced to work in brothels.
Moon's government has said it will not seek to renegotiate the 2015 deal. Last year it vowed to shut down the Japan-sponsored fund and pursue a more ""victim-oriented"" approach.

With Kim's death, only 23 registered South Korean survivors are still alive, underscoring a sense of urgency behind efforts by the women to receive a formal apology and legal compensation from Japan while their voices can still be heard.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2019 01:35AM ET</span>",Facebook takes down hundreds of Indonesian accounts linked to fake news syndicate,"JAKARTA (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has removed hundreds of Indonesian accounts, pages and groups from its social network after discovering they were linked to an online group accused of spreading hate speech and fake news.
Indonesian police uncovered the existence of the group, called Saracen, in 2016 and arrested three of its members on suspicion of being part of a syndicate being paid to spread incendiary material online through social media.
""These accounts and pages were actively working to conceal what they were doing and were linked to the Saracen Group, an online syndicate in Indonesia,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of Cybersecurity Policy, said on Friday.
""They have using deceptive messaging and... networks of concealed pages and accounts to drive often divisive narratives over key issues of public debates in Indonesia,"" Gleicher told Reuters in an interview.
The world's largest social network has been under pressure from regulators around the globe to fight spread of misinformation on its platform. In January, it announced two new regional operations centers focused on monitoring election-related content in its Dublin and Singapore offices.
Indonesia is currently in the run-up to a presidential election set to take place in April, with internet watchdogs flagging the impact of fake news as a concern. 
Indonesia is estimated to be Facebook's third largest markets, with over a 100 million users.
Indonesia's police cyber crime unit has previously told Reuters that Saracen was posting material involving religious and ethnic issues, as well as fake news and posts that defamed government officials. 
The country has an ethnically diverse population of 260 million people, with a big majority of Muslims but with significant religious minorities, and ensuring unity across the archipelago has been a priority of governments.
Gleicher said Facebook's investigation found Saracen agents would target and compromise accounts, but stressed the removal of the accounts was due to ""coordinated deceptive behavior (by Saracen)... not due to the content they had shared"".
The pages and accounts deleted had 170,000 followers on Facebook and more than 65,000 on Instagram, but the reach of the people exposed to the content is believed to be higher.
Police alleged there were financial links between Saracen and a handful of organizers of 2016 protests against the former governor of Jakarta, who was condemned for blasphemy after a doctored video of supposed anti-Islam comments went viral. 
However, the Indonesian supreme court ruled in April 2018 that Saracen had not been guilty of spreading hate speech and that the police's case could not be proven.
A national police spokesman said they were continuing to monitor Saracen's social media activity and would ask Facebook for the data from their investigation.

A lawyer for Jasriadi, whom prosecutors allege was one of the masterminds of the Indonesian syndicate, said ""that based on the facts of the case and our hearing, there remains no evidence that Saracen exists"".

Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian held in an Australian-run camp on a Papua New Guinea island, won the A$100,000 ($72,390) Victorian Prize for literature on Thursday with his book ""No Friends but the Mountains"".
Boochani, who has been held in the Manus Island camp since shortly after he was plucked off a refugee boat on its way to Australia six years ago, said he hoped the prize would focus attention on the plight of more than 1,000 people in Australia's off-shore camps.
""I don't want to celebrate this achievement while I still see many innocent people suffering around me,"" Boochani told Reuters in an exchange of text messages.
Boochani has been a prominent critic of the treatment of people under Australia’s hardline immigration policy.
Asylum seekers intercepted at sea are sent for ""processing"" to three camps in PNG and one on the South Pacific island of Nauru, where many have languished for years. They are not allowed to set foot in Australia.
Boochani said one of his biggest fears when he was writing the book was that his telephone would be confiscated by camp guards.
""I was worried that if they attacked my room they would take my property,"" he said.
He wrote the book in his native Farsi and sent it via the WhatsApp messaging service to a translator in Australia.
The award was announced on Thursday at a ceremony in Australia, a country Boochani has been banned from ever visiting.
""It brings enormous shame to the Australian government,"" Boochani said of the policy responsible for his plight.

The value of the seized goods - which equates to around 500 elephants and up to 13,000 pangolins - was over HK$62 million, ($7.90 million) officials said on Friday. Originating in Nigeria, the shipment was bound for Vietnam, they added.
In a separate incident, customs officials in the northern Vietnamese port of Hai Phong discovered another 1.4 tonnes of pangolin scales in a shipping container sent from Nigeria, the state-run Vietnam News Agency reported on Friday.
Last October, Vietnam intercepted more than more than eight metric tonnes of pangolin scales and ivory, also from Nigeria, in one of the Southeast Asian country’s largest wildlife trafficking cases for years.
The Chinese territory of Hong Kong, located on the country's southern coast, is a global blackspot for wildlife trafficking. The city is a key transit point, supplying an array of wildlife products including timber, shark's fin and rhino horn across Asia and particularly mainland China. 
Customs on January 16th, seized about 8,300 kilograms of pangolin scales and 2,100 kilograms of ivory tusks at the Kwai Chung cargo port located in the former British colony. 
It was the largest single seizure of pangolin parts in Hong Kong.
Yueng Ka-yan, head of command at Hong Kong's Customs and Excise Department, said the smugglers used a new method to hide the endangered species by a process of 'solidification' where they used ice bags and frozen meat to obscure the species. 
""The low temperature environment created by the ice bags and frozen meat helped mask the distinctive smell of the pangolin scales.""
Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are critically endangered. They are coveted for their meat -- considered a delicacy -- and their scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat aliments from cancer to arthritis. 
""It is clearly impossible that the pangolin species can withstand such high rates of poaching, trafficking and trade. Eight tonnes is outrageous,"" said Alex Hofford, campaign manager for conservation group WildAid in Hong Kong.
WildAid estimates 100,000 pangolins are poached from the wild each year, with all 8 species of pangolin in Africa, and especially Asia, now under threat. 
Customs officials who worked with their mainland counterparts to intercept the goods, found the species buried under frozen meat inside a refrigerated container.
Officials said two people had been arrested in connection with the case. 
In a 2018 review released on Thursday, customs officials said there had been a 72 percent increase in seizures of endangered species with the total volume of goods seized increasing more than treble. 
ADM Capital Foundation, which focuses on environmental challenges across Asia, wrote in a January report that wildlife trafficking should be incorporated under Hong Kong's Organised and Serious Crime Ordinance (OSCO). 
Doing so would provide ""a powerful disincentive to wildlife criminals, and importantly, would prevent reinvestment of profits into further criminal activities,"" the report said.

It was one of the largest groups of names disclosed by the church as it faces U.S. state and federal investigations into its handling of decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by priests. 
The names were posted online by the state's 15 Catholic dioceses and follow an August grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailing seven decades of abuse of thousands of children by more than 300 priests. 
""The Bishops of Texas have decided to release the names of these priests at this time because it is right and just and to offer healing and hope to those who have suffered,"" said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Galveston-Houston diocese, who is also president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
In the months after the Pennsylvania report, dozens of other dioceses around the United States have released the names of hundreds of priests and others accused of abuse. Some states have opened their own investigations into the church. 
Texas' Catholic dioceses have been in the spotlight since November when authorities searched the offices of the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston looking for documents related to a priest charged in September with sex crimes.
About 30 percent of Texas' population, or 8.5 million people, identify as Catholics, one of the highest rates for any U.S. state, according to the USCCB.
Some of the 15 Texas dioceses listed priests accused of abuse going back as far as the 1940s. Others like Laredo only went back to 2000, when it was created, and listed no names. 
It was not clear whether the release of names would result in prosecutors bringing charges. The majority of the priests identified in Texas have died, as is the case in most dioceses around the country.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's government under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has used repressive laws to prosecute peaceful critics, dashing hopes that its first democratic leader in decades would safeguard free speech, Human Rights Watch said on Friday.
Freedom of expression has been deteriorating since her administration came to power in 2016, with prosecutions creating a ""climate of fear"" among journalists, the rights group said in its report, ""Dashed Hopes: The Criminalization of Peaceful Expression in Myanmar"".
""Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy promised a new Myanmar but the government still prosecutes peaceful speech and protests and has failed to revise old oppressive laws,"" Linda Lakhdhir, Asia legal adviser at Human Rights Watch and the report's author, said in a statement. 
A government spokesman could not be reached for comment.
The military governments that ruled Myanmar for decades placed severe restrictions on free speech. Reforms undertaken by the quasi-civilian administration that came to power in 2010, including the abolition of censorship, had ""positive implications for speech and assembly"", HRW said. 
However, the Suu Kyi-led government had made ""only marginal changes"" to oppressive legislation and continued to use ""overly broad, vague, and abusive laws"" to prosecute peaceful speech and assembly, it said.
Myanmar free speech group Athan, whose report was quoted by HRW, said some 140 cases had been filed since 2016 under the Telecommunications Act, at least half of which involved prosecution for peaceful speech. 
Parliament made some amendments to section 66(d) of the act, which punishes anyone who ""defames"" someone using a telecommunications network with up to two years in prison, but rejected calls to repeal the provision.
Reporters were especially vulnerable to prosecution and attacks, HRW said, with threats coming from authorities as well as nationalists and militant supporters of the government or army.
""The result has been a climate of fear among local journalists,"" the HRW report said.
Laws criminalizing defamation, the Official Secrets Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the 1934 Aircraft Act, and section 131 of the Myanmar Penal Code have all been used against journalists in recent years.
Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years in prison in September 2018 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. They had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in Rakhine state.
""Aung San Suu Kyi's government has had a real opportunity to abolish the tools of oppression used by the military juntas, but has instead used them against peaceful critics and protesters,” Lakhdhir said.

""It's not too late to reverse course and take steps to fully protect speech and assembly in Myanmar,"" she said.

Trump also said he had never spoken with his longtime political ally Roger Stone about WikiLeaks and the stolen Democratic Party emails it made public during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, nor had he directed anyone to do so, the Times said.
""He told the attorneys that I'm not a subject, I'm not a target,"" Trump said of Rosenstein's comment about the Mueller probe, according to the Times.
Mueller is leading an investigation into what U.S. intelligence agencies have said was Russian interference in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency, and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Trump calls the investigation a witch hunt and denies any collusion with Russia, Moscow denies meddling in the election.
Stone pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges that he tried to obstruct a congressional investigation into the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Charging documents after Stone's arrest a week ago alleged a senior Trump campaign official ""was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information"" WikiLeaks had about the campaign of Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
The Times said when Trump was asked whether he had spoken with Stone about WikiLeaks and the stolen emails, he said, ""No, I didn't. I never did.""

Asked whether he had directed anyone to get in touch with Stone about WikiLeaks, Trump said, ""Never did,"" according to the Times.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar policeman who told a court last year how officers planted secret documents on two Reuters reporters in order to ""entrap"" them was released from prison on Friday, after being sentenced to a year in jail for violating police discipline.
In widely covered testimony at the trial of journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing gave details of the hours leading up to the Dec. 12, 2017 arrest of the Reuters reporters and said police had arranged a ""set up"".
Shortly after that court appearance in April, Moe Yan Naing was sentenced to prison for violating the Police Disciplinary Act by having previously spoken to Wa Lone. His family was also evicted from their police housing in the capital Naypyitaw.
Moe Yan Naing criticized the law under which he was punished.
""This police disciplinary law is one of the laws we must amend while we are marching on the path towards democracy,"" he told reporters outside Insein prison, on the outskirts of the commercial capital Yangon, after his release.
""This law can cause police much suffering because it is outdated,"" he said.
Police spokesman Colonel Myo Thu Soe told Reuters at the time of the sentencing Moe Yan Naing had been punished ""according to the police disciplinary act"" and that his ""case has been processed by a police court"", without elaborating.
Police also said at the time the eviction order was not related to Moe Yan Naing's testimony at the trial of the Reuters journalists.
Asked how he felt about the people who ordered his arrest, Moe Yan Naing said he would console himself through religion.
""I am a Buddhist, I can find peace with that through our Buddhist way,"" he said, and that he felt ""sorry"" for the two reporters still behind bars.
A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. 
Moe Yan Naing was released after serving around nine months of his one-year sentence. It is customary for prisoners in Myanmar to have their jail time reduced for good behavior. 
In September, the Yangon court found Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo guilty of breaking the colonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced them to seven years in jail.
The reporters had been working at the time of their arrest on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in western Myanmar's Rakhine state. The killings happened during an army crackdown that sent some 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.
Moe Yan Naing testified in court that a senior officer had ordered a subordinate to meet Wa Lone at a restaurant in Yangon and plant ""secret documents"" on him.

An appellate court rejected appeals by Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo last month, saying the defense had not provided sufficient evidence to show they were innocent.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>","As Democrats target Trump's tax returns, audit claims loom large","By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats exploring ways to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns may target the adequacy of the Internal Revenue Service audit that Trump often cites as his reason for not making the returns public, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Such a strategy, focused more on the IRS than on Trump, could help Democrats craft an iron-clad legal argument for what would likely follow from such a request - an unprecedented court battle over the tax records of a sitting president.
Targeting the audit would put the request for the returns squarely within the oversight authority of the House of Representatives' tax committee, which oversees the IRS, and deflect Republican accusations of a fishing expedition by Democrats unfairly targeting the president, the sources said.
House tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, who has vowed to request Trump's returns, said this week that the long-standing audit claim could be the basis on which the committee ultimately decides whether to go to court to obtain the returns. 
The returns are expected to become an issue soon. A subcommittee of Neal's panel on Thursday set a hearing for Feb. 7 on ""presidential and vice-presidential tax returns.” A spokeswoman said the hearing would cover ""H.R. 1,"" a bill that would require presidential candidates to release their tax records for elections. 
Another strategy for House Democrats might be to probe whether Trump profited from the Republican tax overhaul that he signed into law in 2017, or how his income could be affected by amendments to the tax code likely to come before the committee in months ahead. 
No decisions have been made, and sources with knowledge of the discussions could not say how much weight House officials working on the issue might give to any proposal.
The deliberations reflect the caution Democrats are taking in launching investigations of Trump, his businesses and his presidency, now that they have majority control of the House.
""The president has repeatedly said on the campaign trail and then after becoming president, he intended to do this, to release them, except that he was under audit,"" said Neal, the only House member authorized by law to request Trump's returns from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
""So that's the basis we proceed on,"" Neal told reporters on Tuesday. ""If we can't have a voluntary submission, then we use the legal apparatus that's available to us.""
A Democratic spokesman for the committee declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for the Treasury, which supervises the Internal Revenue Service, said Mnuchin will review the legality of any request for Trump's returns with the department's legal counsel.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
'SHALL FURNISH'
As the Republican presidential nominee in 2016, Trump broke with decades of precedent by refusing to release his returns, saying they were being audited by the IRS. Many tax experts have replied that an IRS audit does not preclude their release. 
As president, Trump has retained ownership of extensive hotel interests and other business ventures. For this reason, House Democrats say his returns would be a linchpin for oversight investigations of potential ties between the president and Russia and other conflicts of interest.
Federal law gives the chairmen of the House tax panel, the Senate Finance Committee and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, the authority to request any return and says that the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" it. 
Trump and Mnuchin are widely expected to fight any such action. The law has been used to obtain tax records, which are normally held in strict secrecy by the IRS. But in the interests of transparency, modern presidents have routinely disclosed their returns to the public voluntarily.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats and outside groups have ramped up pressure on Neal to act swiftly to obtain Trump's returns and eventually release them to the public.
""The law is very clear that we're entitled to get those returns,"" Representative Lloyd Doggett told CNN on Thursday.
""If the Treasury secretary... refuses to do it, then we will have to take some court action,"" said Doggett, a senior Democratic member of Neal's Ways and Means Committee.
'BAD PRECEDENT'
Experts say an approach without careful justification could leave Democrats vulnerable to Republican claims of overreach.
""It sets a very, very bad precedent. If they can demand that the public see the president's tax returns, what's going to keep them from demanding to see anyone's tax returns,"" said Representative Kenny Marchant, a Republican on Neal's panel.

The legal strategy of focusing on IRS audits of Trump is only one option at Neal's disposal. ""There's a variety of legitimate reasons for why Ways and Means would seek the president's tax returns,"" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.

Australia is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Two Australian Super Hornets dropped bombs on a building and courtyard after Iraqi security forces had called for help to strike a neighborhood in west Mosul where Islamic State fighters had set up positions, the Defence Department said.
There was no specific intelligence suggesting civilians were at the targeted sites, but the Defence Department said ""it was impossible to be sure under the urgent circumstances facing the Iraqi forces at the time,"" adding that the Australian jet fighters hit their intended targets.
The Australian Defence Force was alerted by the U.S.-led coalition last January to claims on a website that tracks civilian deaths in war, Airwars, that there were civilians in a nearby building. Following an investigation completed in December, the Australian Defence Force concluded the claims were ""credible.""
""Ultimately we have determined that it is possible civilians were unintentionally killed by the Coalition during these strikes,"" Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld said in a statement. ""Any loss of civilian life is highly regrettable and we treat all allegations seriously,"" he said.
The coalition estimated that between six and 18 civilians may have been killed.
The coalition conducted 32,397 strikes in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2018, and estimates that at least 1,190 civilians were killed ""unintentionally"" in that period, the joint force said in a statement on Thursday.
Australia ended its strike aircraft operations in Iraq and Syria in January.

The shipwreck took place early on Sunday, the source said, and its cause is unknown. The migrants were traveling without visas and were being transported by traffickers to Panama.
Survivors told the agency the boat was carrying about 30 people, some of whom remain missing, the source said. 
The source could not confirm the migrants' nationalities.
A spokesman from the migration agency said it was waiting on information from the navy and did not have a comment at this time.
The jungle region in northern Colombia, bordered by Panama and the Caribbean, is often used for illegal migrant trafficking. 
Many of the people who use routes through the area are Cuban or African and are attempting to reach the United States eventually.
At least 57,000 people have been detected attempting to use the route in the past five years, according to official Colombian figures.

Security Council to review Central African arms embargo by end-September,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council agreed on Thursday to review arms embargo measures on Central African Republic by the end of September if the country makes progress in areas including reform of its security sector and management of its weapons. 
CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons shipments to the government must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members. It operates by consensus.
Central African Republic has long wanted the arms embargo restrictions on the government to be lifted and French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the resolution adopted on Thursday show the council was open to that. 
Central African Republic has been battered by violence since 2013 when mainly Muslim Selaka rebels ousted then president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias. U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in 2014. 
After CAR asked for help in 2017 to fight marauding militias, both Russia and France sent weapons to the country last year with Security Council approval, sparking a rivalry for influence in the country.
Last month Russia and China abstained in a Security Council vote to extend the peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic because the French-drafted resolution did not make direct reference to Russia's efforts to help the country.
In the resolution adopted on Thursday, the Security Council said it would establish benchmarks by the end of April for CAR ""that could serve in guiding the Security Council to review the arms embargo measures.""

It asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to assess CAR's progress against those benchmarks by the end of July. The council will then review the arms embargo measures by the end of September.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A change in government in Venezuela would favor the country's two main foreign creditors Russia and China, Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
Guaido said he had sent communications to both allies of President Nicolas Maduro, who accuses Guaido of staging a coup against his socialist administration. The United States and a number of other countries now recognize Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state.
""What most suits Russia and China is the country's stability and a change of government,"" he said. ""Maduro does not protect Venezuela, he doesn't protect anyone's investments, and he is not a good deal for those countries.""
Guaido was speaking from his Caracas home where earlier on Thursday agents from a feared special police unit turned up to ask for his wife, a sign of increasing pressure Maduro is putting on the opposition.
In the interview, he said he ""had no fear"" of a possible arrest after the Supreme Court approved the opening of a preliminary investigation into his actions on Tuesday, imposing a travel ban and a freeze on his bank accounts.
Guaido said the Venezuelan government would be ""responsible"" to its creditors and bondholders. Guaido does not yet control any of the state's functions, which remain loyal to Maduro despite the opposition's calls for defections.
Guaido said he was evaluating how to take control of state-run oil firm PDVSA's U.S. unit Citgo, Venezuela's biggest foreign asset, as the Trump administration tries to use the company as leverage to topple Maduro.
The U.S. government and Guaido are trying to appoint a new board of directors for Citgo.
Under a future government, PDVSA would remain in state hands, Guaido said, adding the top priority would be on recovering production in the devastated oil sector.

""We are here to provide certainty to the economy, society and in politics,"" he said.

The figure was disclosed by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, who slammed senior Pentagon officials for failing to disclose that information during a hearing before his committee in Congress on the issue on Tuesday.
""This was at best an error in judgment, and at worst flat-out dishonesty,"" Smith said, adding he had spoken with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan about it.
Shanahan told reporters the same day as the hearing that thousands more troops were headed to the border but the 3,500 figure was only disclosed on Thursday. There are currently about 2,350 troops involved in the border mission.
""I have followed up on that hearing with a phone call to Secretary Shanahan, and he has provided more details on the increase. I appreciate his willingness to discuss it with me, but a phone call is not a substitute for transparency before Congress and public candor,"" Smith said.
The Pentagon says the U.S. military will operate mobile surveillance cameras in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, a mission that is scheduled to run through Sept. 30. Some of the additional troops will also string up 150 more miles of concertina wire by March 31.
The Pentagon first approved the high-profile deployment of active-duty U.S. troops to the Mexico border in October, ahead of U.S. midterm congressional elections. It was embraced by Trump's supporters, including Republicans in Congress.

However, critics have assailed the deployment as a political stunt and scoffed at Trump's comparisons of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, to an ""invasion.""

494,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",Outsider favored to win El Salvador presidential election,"By Nelson Renteria
SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The two parties that have ruled El Salvador for three decades could lose their grip on power on Sunday if voters choose as president a young outsider from a small third party who has vowed to lift the economy and stem the flow of migrants from one of the world's most violent countries.
Opinion polls in the Central American country give former San Salvador mayor Nayib Bukele a strong lead, which could make him the first leader not drawn from the left- and right-wing parties that have ruled El Salvador since 1989.
The ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), needs a massive upset if the leftist party is to cling to power. Its traditional rival, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), also lags well behind Bukele, who belongs to a smaller right-wing party called the Great Alliance for National Unity (GANA).
Disenchantment with both dominant parties has provided a solid voter base for Bukele, a 37-year-old businessman. Still, voter surveys indicate the race should be close. 
Pollster Mitofsky said in a January poll that Bukele had 57 percent of voter support, while Gallup's January poll showed him with just 42 percent of support.
To win outright, he must secure more than 50 percent of the vote or face a run-off against his closest rival on March 10. About 5.3 million Salvadorans are registered to vote. 
""Thirty years have gone and there have been no changes, the country is getting worse,"" 63-year-old mechanic Mauricio Hernandez said at a rally for a Bukele. 
Even if Bukele does break the mold of the last three decades, his legislative room for maneuver could be limited because his GANA party is expected to lack a majority in Congress.
Gang violence has made El Salvador one of the world's most murderous countries in the past few years. The region's high level of violence is a major factor in the mass migration from Central America to the United States that has drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.
A year ago, El Salvador sent the United States a formal letter of protest after Trump reportedly disparaged the homelands of some immigrants with an insulting expletive. 
Trump made the remark shortly after announcing he would cut a program that allowed some 200,000 Salvadorans to live and work in the United States, a move that gave them about a year and a half to seek lawful residency or return to El Salvador.
Trump has also repeatedly threatened to cut aid to the impoverished country if it did not do more to stem the flow of migrants headed north. 
Discontent has swelled under the current FMLN government after corruption scandals engulfed leading politicians in a country struggling with rampant poverty. Sitting President Salvador Sanchez Ceren is barred by law from seeking immediate re-election to a fresh five-year term.
Following in the footsteps of other politicians in the region, Bukele has pledged to root out corruption, adopting the motto: ""there is enough money when nobody is stealing."" 

A prolific social media user, he also wants to modernize government and push infrastructure projects as a means of curbing emigration to the United States, where one in four Salvadorans live.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>",U.S. to announce suspension of compliance with nuclear pact: officials,"By Steve Holland, Jonathan Landay and Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will soon announce plans to suspend compliance with a landmark nuclear missile pact with Russia, responding to an alleged violation of the treaty by Moscow, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
The move would start a six-month countdown that could lead to permanent U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 arms control accord, which bans either side from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe, the officials said. 
However, Washington could choose not to pull out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), if Russia comes into compliance with the treaty within that time frame.
The United States alleges that a new Russian cruise missile violates the pact. The missile, the Novator 9M729, is known as the SSC-8 by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
Russia denies the allegation, saying the missile’s range puts it outside the treaty, and has accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty Washington wants to leave anyway so it can develop new missiles. Russia has also rejected a U.S. demand to destroy the new missile.
""We’re going to announce suspension,"" a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
A second U.S. official said the U.S. action would be ""reversible"" if Russia came back into compliance during the six-month U.S. suspension. ""Then the U.S. would unsuspend,"" the official said.
The dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia frictions since the Cold War ended in 1991. Some experts believe the treaty's collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms.
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson on Thursday held last-ditch talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Beijing ahead of the expiration on Saturday of a U.S. 60-day deadline for Moscow to return to compliance with the treaty.
Thompson and Ryabkov said afterwards that the two countries had failed to bridge their differences. They met on the sidelines of a meeting of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - all nuclear powers.
European officials are concerned about the treaty's possible collapse, fearful that Europe could again become an arena for nuclear-armed, intermediate-range missile buildups by the United States and Russia. 
In an interview, Thompson said she expected Washington to stop complying with the treaty as soon as this weekend, a move she said would allow the U.S. military to immediately begin developing its own longer-range missiles if it chose to do so, raising the prospect they could be deployed in Europe. 
""We’ll be able to do that (suspend our treaty obligations) on Feb. 2,"" she told Reuters in Beijing. ""We’ll have an announcement made, follow all the steps that need to be taken on the treaty to suspend our obligations with the intent to withdraw.""
Once announced, the formal withdrawal process takes six months. Halting treaty compliance would untie the U.S. military's hands, Thompson said. 
""We are then also able to conduct the R&D and work on the systems we haven’t been able to use because we’ve been in compliance with the treaty,"" she said. ""Come February 2, this weekend, if DoD (the U.S. Department of Defense) chooses to do that, they’ll be able to do that.""
Washington remained open to further talks with Moscow about the treaty, she added. 
Ryabkov said Moscow would continue working toward an agreement but accused Washington of ignoring Russian complaints about U.S. missiles and of adopting what he called a destructive position. 
""The United States imposed a 60-day period during which we had to fulfill their ultimatum,"" the Sputnik news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying after talks with Thompson. ""I conclude that the United States was not expecting any decision and all this was a game made to cover their domestic decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty.""
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington think tank, said he sees little chance the treaty can be saved.
""Neither side is showing the flexibility necessary to arrive with an agreement that brings Russia into compliance,"" he said. ""So I think it’s highly unlikely that we will see an 11th hour diplomatic miracle. 

""Both sides at this point appear more interested in winning the blame game than taking the steps necessary to save the treaty,"" he added.

Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist living in the United States, was killed on Oct. 2 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to collect documents for his planned wedding.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - In Dubai's overflowing churches and Riyadh's secretive masses, Catholics across the Gulf are eagerly awaiting Pope Francis' historic visit to the United Arab Emirates next week.
They hope the first ever trip by a pope to the Arabian Peninsula will foster greater acceptance for its two million expatriate Catholics, many from India and the Philippines. 
They want better transport to UAE churches and permission to build them at all in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia.
The trip comes as the UAE makes a push to show it is a country tolerant of other religions and at a time of social reform elsewhere in the Gulf.
The visit would reflect ""what the UAE has always been: a cradle of diversity, centered between East and West, connecting people, religions, goods, and cultures,"" said a UAE government spokesman, Jaber Al Lamki.
Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan invited the pontiff after meeting him at the Vatican in 2016. Lamki said the visit was ""unsurprising"" given the number of Catholics in the UAE and it had taken time to plan it.
The Vatican says the trip will focus on inter-religious dialogue and peace.
""It will help the Gulf and the whole world understand there should be respect for each religion,"" said Claudia Rumie, a maths tutor from Colombia. 
She attends mass near Dubai's Jebel Ali port in a church on a compound with houses of worship from other faiths and will be among the 120,000 Catholics attending the pope's mass in a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi. 
Most UAE citizens are Sunni Muslims, but foreigners, often working in offices, schools, homes and constructions sites, outnumber locals by around nine to one. Around half the Gulf's Catholics live in the UAE. 
Priests, worshippers and two diplomats said that while the UAE is already the most tolerant Gulf country toward faiths other than Islam, there are restrictions. 
The authorities forbid unsanctioned religious gatherings and non-Muslims must not proselytize, according to the law. Churches do not ring bells and do not display visible cross, according to church building agreements, church officials say. 
Land for building houses of worship is limited so there are only nine Catholic churches in the UAE. Pews are packed at the weekend, with parishioners spilling outside where mass is sometimes broadcast on screens.
Father Reinhold Sahner, the German parish priest of St Francis church in Dubai said some parishioners have long bus journeys to church. 
""It is good that the pope comes and knows about our realities, he knows also about our difficulties,"" Sahner said.
SECURITY CHECKPOINT
Although the pope will only go to the UAE, his visit is being watched closely by Catholics elsewhere in the peninsula, who are also hoping for more acceptance. 
In Qatar churches are allowed but Catholics say they feel restricted outside their place of worship.
Qatar's first Catholic church, the 3,000-seat Church of our Lady of the Rosary, was built in 2008 in a walled-off compound known as the Religious Complex, on the southern outskirts of the capital. It has a permanent security checkpoint.
""We are free and can celebrate mass, but the condition is that you can only do these things inside the complex,"" said parish priest Rally Gonzaga.
The Qatari foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Churches are also allowed in Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain but in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, they are banned. 
Some Catholics in Riyadh attend mass in private homes and embassies, where they say their presence is monitored but largely ignored by authorities. 
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comments.
One worshipper said he gave the compound gatekeeper a password to attend a regular embassy service. 
""It's kind of secure and protected but I don't talk about it with my colleagues,"" he said.
Recent outreach by Saudi Arabia to Christian representatives has given Christians hope for change. 
Last year King Salman met the head of the Vatican's pontifical council for inter-religious dialogue in Riyadh. Lebanon's Christian Maronite Patriarch also visited to discuss religious tolerance and combating extremism, according to Saudi state media.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reforms. 
He said he wants “middle-of-the-road, moderate Islam open to the world and all religions, traditions and people”. He met the head of the Anglican church in London last year and also visited Egypt's largest Coptic cathedral.
Catholic Toni El-Rahi, who moved to Saudi Arabia from Lebanon in 1994, says attitudes among regular Saudis are shifting with the reforms.
""They also have to go with the flow,"" he said.

Catholics don't feel comfortable wearing crosses, he says. But his family allowed media to photograph Christian iconography at their home and he no longer fears the religious police whose wings have been clipped to loosen strict morality rules.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Thousands of U.S.-bound Central American migrants resumed their northern journey on Thursday, Mexico City officials said, part of a growing group of would-be asylum seekers who say they are fleeing violence and poverty back home. 
Around 2,400 migrants left a city shelter to begin the journey from the Mexican capital early Thursday morning, the latest caravan to embark upon the risky path to the U.S.-Mexican border despite U.S. President Donald Trump's determination to prevent them from entering. 
Since last October, thousands of mostly Central American migrants have sought to cross into the United States, many traveling in caravans in order to minimize the risks of kidnapping and attacks by members of criminal gangs while in Mexican territory.
The likelihood of having to wait weeks or even months at the border, where migrants face high rates of violent crime, has not dented the group's enthusiasm. 
""I know it's violent at the border, but I have to take that risk. I don't have any more money and my family is waiting for me in the United States,"" said Honduran migrant Maria Murillo alongside her young son, as she waited to leave the shelter.
Other migrants were carefully studying their options, hoping to improve their chances of crossing the border and being able to stay.
""I'm not thinking of going to (Mexican border city) Tijuana, but I will make it to Monterrey,"" said fellow Honduran Oscar Lopez, referring to the northern city which he thinks may offer easier access to cross the border.
Lopez, 33, was traveling with his wife and two children. 
On Tuesday, the United States government sent the first Central American asylum seeker back to Mexico through the Tijuana border crossing, part of the hardened immigration policy pursued by the Trump Administration.
Many migrants expressed their opposition to the new U.S. policy, arguing that it will expose them to more risks at increasingly violent border towns, while others say they may eventually try to cross illegally.
""I'm not thinking of returning to Honduras, and if it's necessary, I'll pay to have a (smuggler) help me cross,"" said Mauricio Gomez.

Immigration advocates fear Mexico is not safe for U.S.-bound migrants, who are often kidnapped by gangs and smugglers. They have also raised concerns that applicants sent back to Mexico will not have access to proper legal counsel in U.S. courts.

Sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military is largely under-reported and came under renewed scrutiny two years ago after a scandal involving Marines sharing nude photos of women online came to light.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has ruled that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is liable for at least $302.5 million in damages for its role in the 2012 death of renowned American journalist Marie Colvin while covering the Syrian civil war.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in a ruling made public on Wednesday that the Syrian government ""engaged in an act of extrajudicial killing of a United States national.""
Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed in the besieged Syrian city of Homs while reporting on the Syrian conflict.
The lawsuit filed by Colvin's family in 2016 accused officials in Assad's government of deliberately targeting rockets against a makeshift broadcast studio where Colvin and other reporters were living and working.
Jackson wrote that ""a targeted attack on a media center hosting foreign journalists that resulted in two fatalities and multiple injuries ... is an unconscionable act."" The judge ruled that compensatory damages to be awarded in addition to the $300 million in punitive damages would be calculated at a later date.

A biographical film about Colvin, called ""A Private War"" and starring British actress Rosamund Pike, was released last year, bringing fresh attention to her career.

NEAUPHLE-LE-CHATEAU, France (Reuters) - Forty years ago this month, the man who would go on to lead the Islamic revolution in Iran lived in a simple house in a village outside Paris, spending his days cross-legged under an apple tree in the garden, contemplating insurrection.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had fled Iran in the mid-1960s, fearing a crackdown on his teachings by the Shah. 
After a brief time in Turkey he moved to Iraq, but was later expelled from the holy city of Najaf by Saddam Hussein in 1978. 
He would end up in sleepy Neauphle-le-Chateau, west of Paris, where from October that year until his return to Tehran in February 1979, he quietly fomented unrest, nurturing the Islamist revolution that persists to this day.
Artist Jean-Claude Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), 61, lived down the road from the ayatollah at the time and distinctly remembers the bearded Shia cleric in his robes and black turban occasionally walking through the streets with extra protection from French police.
""For the folks of Neauphle-le-Chateau, for us, we were telling ourselves, 'Why give as much importance, why completely shut down the town, with all these police and these helicopters, for this man?' whose purpose we didn't understand,"" said Cintas.
""Even if we knew he was fighting against the Shah of Iran.""
Reuters archive video from the time shows Khomeini sitting on a mattress under an apple tree, Persian prayer rugs in front of him, in quiet conversation. His black glasses are held by the stem in his right hand, which shakes slightly.
Other pictures show him walking in the village street with two young boys, one of them his grandson, the sides of the roads covered in snow, police looking on. Some footage shows him meeting members of the Iranian and Western press.
AYATOLLAH ANECDOTES
Another resident, Michelle Laverdaque, said anecdotes had always circulated in the village about Khomeini, even if there is little today to show he was ever there, apart from a tourist sign explaining the history around the fall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
She said word was that the ayatollah and those with him had viewed several houses in the village, including much grander ones, before fixing on the simple abode, perhaps in part because it had a large window facing toward Mecca.
""He chose a very modest, a very humble house. If I understood correctly... it was because there was a big window facing west and another facing east and as such he could do his prayers facing the valley,"" she told Reuters. 
Paul Taylor, a young correspondent with Reuters at the time, was assigned to cover the cleric and spent time interviewing him during his four-month French exile, a period during which his homeland was in turmoil, with the Shah set to flee.
""Khomeini was incredibly placid throughout all this,"" said Taylor. ""He showed very little emotion, he was calm, he was almost slightly on another planet.""
The Shah eventually fled Iran on Jan. 16, 1979 and two weeks later Khomeini flew to Tehran on a chartered Air France flight, accompanied by dozens of journalists. He was welcomed triumphantly, with millions cramming the streets.
""When they left France, they didn't know whether the plane will be shot down, whether they would be allowed to land,"" recalled Taylor. 
Having helped bring down a monarchy that had endured for more than 2,000 years, Khomeini would go on to oversee Iran as its Supreme Leader until his death in 1989, aged 86.

His one-time home in Neauphle-le-Chateau remains as modest as ever, the house white, the shutters painted green, a simple wooden gate leading to the front door.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The regional parliament of the German state of Brandenburg voted on Thursday to make political parties put an equal number of men and women up for elections.
The bill, proposed by the Green party and backed by the Social Democrats and the Left which govern the state in a coalition, makes Brandenburg the first German region to set such a gender rule. It comes into force in the second half of 2020.
Women hold just over a third of the seats in the Brandenburg parliament, a shortfall often put down to parties' failure to put enough women candidates forward.
Although Germany has been led by a woman, Chancellor Angela Merkel, for the past 13 years, women are under-represented in politics and business. The share of women in the federal parliament fell from 36.5 percent to 30.8 percent between 2013 and 2017.
Arguably the world's most powerful woman, Merkel has never positioned herself as a campaigning feminist. Gender parity ""just seems logical,"" she told Die Zeit newspaper on Sunday. ""That's not something I have to bring up constantly."" 
Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) voted against the bill.
Norway enacted measures for gender balance in politics decades ago. In 1983, the Norwegian Labour Party imposed a 40 quota for women candidates and was followed by other parties and municipalities. Oslo imposed a similar law for the boards of listed companies in 2008.

Feminist activists said they hoped Brandenburg's decision would serve as an example for other states and the federal parliament.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 12:19PM ET</span>",Lebanese leaders agree new government: political sources,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese leaders reached a deal on Thursday to set up a new unity government, three political sources from different factions said, ending months of wrangling that has added to concerns for the heavily indebted state. 
The news boosted Lebanon's bonds, with a 2037 dollar issue jumping in price by 4.3 cents to its highest since August.
The Western-backed prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri now faces a big challenge in delivering reforms needed to address the dire public finances and unlock billions of dollars in pledged aid and loans to boost low growth. 
The new government will include most of Lebanon's rival factions, who have been negotiating over the make-up of the cabinet since a May 6 election in which allies of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group gained ground. 
The government will be announced on Thursday, the sources said, as Hariri met President Michel Aoun at the presidential palace in Baabda. Media reports said he was later joined by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
A senior official said Ali Hassan Khalil will stay on as finance minister, and a source familiar with the government formation talks said Hezbollah had chosen Shi'ite doctor Jamil Jabak, who is not a member of the group, as health minister.
By picking the health minister, the heavily armed Hezbollah will be moving beyond the more marginal role it has played in past governments: the ministry has the fourth-biggest budget in the state apparatus, the outgoing minister has said. 
The United States regards Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and has put new sanctions on the group as part of a campaign against Iran. 
Since the election, Hariri's last government, appointed in late 2016, has continued in a caretaker capacity. 
Hariri lost more than a third of his lawmakers in the election but kept his status as the leading Sunni Muslim and so returns as premier, a position reserved for his sect under Lebanon's sectarian system of rule.
But the election produced a parliament tilted in favor of Hezbollah thanks to gains by groups and individuals that support its possession of a major arsenal. Together, they won more than 70 of the 128 seats. 
While Lebanon's economy and financial system have shown resilience during previous periods of political paralysis, investor concerns have been reflected of late in bond prices and the costs of insuring against debt default.
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Markets in London, said the new government would need to show it was able to implement tough reforms in order to reassure financial market investors after their positive early response. 
""It's taken them nine months to put together a government, let alone how long it will take to agree on the very harsh fiscal consolidation that would be needed to put the debt position on a firmer footing,"" he said.

Hariri, speaking earlier on Thursday, said the new government would be forced to ""take difficult decisions"" to reduce spending.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept to power on a wave of optimism in 2015, is set for an ugly reelection campaign this October, judging by exchanges with voters in public town halls this month where he was grilled on topics ranging from immigration to housing affordability.
Opinion polls show his center-left Liberals are barely ahead of their rivals, and party insiders privately admit they might lose their majority in the House of Commons, which would crimp the government's ability to govern.
""The next election is going to be a referendum on Justin Trudeau...and whether or not people think he has performed,"" said Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker.
In contrast to more gentle exchanges in previous years, angry citizens slammed Trudeau for bungling the construction of pipelines, breaking promises to respect the right of indigenous groups, ignoring a pledge to balance the budget and allowing too many migrants into Canada.
Liberal insiders say as a result of the feedback from the town halls, where attendees can also jot down their concerns on paper, policy tweaks are already being considered.
Public unhappiness over illegal immigrants crossing the border from the United States is so great that the party will consider a promise to clamp down further, even though Ottawa considers the matter is under control, said one top Liberal.
Widespread complaints about the lack of affordable housing are likely to produce a commitment for more spending, said the Liberal, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation.
WE HANG TRAITORS FOR TREASON
The verdict from voters is definitely mixed, judging by Trudeau's experiences as he traveled the country in January taking questions from all-comers, a practice he says helps him break out of what he calls the Ottawa bubble.
A woman at a town hall in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada's west, a region where the Liberals are in trouble, accused Trudeau of ""working for your globalist partners"" to betray Canada. 
""What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau?  We used to hang them, hang them for treason,"" the woman told the stunned prime minister after asking him about Moslem sharia law and Saudi Arabian oil imports. 
In the Quebec town of Saint-Hyacinthe, a man dressed in a yellow vest swore loudly at Trudeau and accused him of selling out the country.
Liberals like the town halls on the grounds they demonstrate Trudeau is not afraid to take tough questions. 
Yet they also admit the exchanges show voters have more urgent concerns than topics such as gender equality, climate change and the aboriginal rights that Trudeau has been pushing hard at home and abroad since he took power in 2015.
""We need to focus on things that are of interest to all Canadians and not just some of them,"" conceded a second Liberal.
While Trudeau has emerged as one of the world's leading progressive leaders, at home Canadians are concentrating more on their jobs and taxes, said Bricker.
Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, present in the hall at Saint-Hyacinthe as abuse was leveled at Trudeau, conceded, ""There is a level of anxiety out there and we need to allow for these discussions to happen.""
But insiders say regardless of the insults, Trudeau intends to stick to his policy of avoiding public arguments.
The Liberals won a surprise victory in 2015 by mounting a massive campaign to register young and aboriginal voters and concede a similar effort will be needed this time.
The Liberals have a majority of just 11 in the 338-seat House of Commons and polls show they are only slightly ahead of the main opposition Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer.

""It's going to be tight...the message to the troops is, there is no magic commercial advert that is going to win this campaign. Don't rely on the prime minister to belt one out of the park during the debates,"" said a third Liberal.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament recognized Venezuela's self-declared interim president Juan Guaido as de facto head of state on Thursday, heightening international pressure on the OPEC member's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
EU lawmakers voted 439 in favor to 104 against, with 88 abstentions, at a special session in Brussels to recognize Venezuelan congress head Guaido as interim leader.
In a statement with the non-binding vote, the parliament urged the bloc's 28 governments to follow suit and consider Guaido ""the only legitimate interim president"" until there were ""new free, transparent and credible presidential elections"".
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who spoke to Guaido on Wednesday and wants further EU sanctions on Venezuelan officials, urged counterparts to embrace the 35-year-old head of Venezuela's National Assembly.
""Parliament has spoken. For us, Mr. Guaido is the president of Venezuela and we do hope that the European Union will find a united position on this,"" he told reporters on arrival at a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest. 
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he was ready to join a common position on Venezuela if the bloc could agree what next steps to take.
Though accusing Maduro of stifling democracy, the European Union is nervous at the precedent of a self-declaration, so has been reluctant to follow the United States and most Latin American nations with immediate recognition of Guaido.
Britain, France, Germany and Spain said on Saturday, however, that they would recognize Guaido unless Maduro called elections within eight days. But the EU as a whole has not set a time limit in its call for a new presidential vote. 
Maduro has dismissed the demands as an unacceptable ultimatum from the corrupt elite of spent colonial powers.
""The leaders of Europe are sycophants, kneeling behind the policies of Donald Trump,"" he said at the weekend. 
The European Parliament has no foreign policy powers but sees itself as a champion of human rights. 
""Those who are demonstrating today in the streets of Venezuela are not Europeans, but they fight for the same values for which we fight,"" Spanish center-right EU lawmaker Esteban Gonzalez Pons said in a statement.
As Venezuela has sunk into economic and political crisis that has brought mass emigration and hyperinflation, the EU imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on officials to decry what it views as rights violations and the rupture of democracy.

On Thursday, the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists said seven foreign journalists were detained in Venezuela, including French and Spanish reporters. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called for their release.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.N. may push back Libya election conference,"By Ulf Laessing and Ayman al-Warfalli
TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The United Nations is likely to delay a conference intended to prepare Libya for elections this year until there is more support from rival leaders, sources familiar with the plans said.
The national meeting is central to a U.N. and Western roadmap for a vote in Libya as a way out of its eight-year war since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.
But big players and their allied armed groups wield considerable power under the status quo, and there is mistrust between rival governments and parliaments.
Libya splintered following the NATO-backed revolt against Gaddafi and has since 2014 been divided between competing political and armed groups based in Tripoli and the east.
More delay in the U.N.-sponsored conference, where Libyans from all walks of society are supposed to decide details of their elections such as the presidential or parliamentary system, would also probably push back an actual vote. 
Under a French plan, Libya was meant to hold elections last Dec. 10, but that was shelved due to divisions among rival leaders and a spike in violence in the capital Tripoli.
In a new push, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame wanted a conference in ""the first weeks of 2019"" with potential polls by June. But momentum for that has been lost due to resistance from major parties backing the parallel governments in Tripoli and the east who benefit from access to oil revenues and jobs for armed groups in the absence of police.
EAST-WEST POWER PLAY
Sources familiar with the U.N. plans told Reuters the conference could still happen by the end of February, but a delay until at least March looked more likely.
""Salame won't announce a venue and date ahead until he thinks there is enough support from all sides,"" one source said.
The U.N. mission in Libya said it was seeking a successful meeting but no date was set yet. ""We plan for the conference to happen as soon as possible,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
Diplomats say the conference is a ""last joker"" in the pack for Salame who has toiled since September 2017 for elections.
Western nations hope ordinary Libyans will pressure armed groups into a peaceful solution 
But in eastern Libya, some worry the forum may give a platform to Islamists and other opponents defeated by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar.
Some 20 lawmakers in the eastern-based parliament last week proposed to ban the Muslim Brotherhood. That would make it difficult to talk to Khaled Mishri, head of a rival parliament in Tripoli who is close to the Brotherhood.
""I personally think the conference is a good idea but it will be hard to achieve results,"" said eastern lawmaker Hamd Bazaq.
Diplomats fear a recent spat between Salame and the LNA might further complicate preparing the conference.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Newspaper owned by Lebanon's Hariri prints last edition,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Readers of the Lebanese daily Al-Mustaqbal leafed through its last print edition on Thursday, its move online underscoring the challenges ailing Lebanon's press industry. 
Al-Mustaqbal, the fourth prominent newspaper to disappear from Lebanon's newsstands in recent years, is owned by caretaker prime minister Saad al-Hariri and echoes his political line.
It was established by his late father Rafik, a two-time prime minister who was assassinated in 2005, and shares the name of the Hariri political movement.
Editor-in-chief Bassam Nounou said it had fallen victim to both the wider problems of lower advertising revenue and competition with social media faced by news outlets globally, and to the financial woes of its parent organization. 
""There's a crisis in print journalism,"" he said, saying the newspaper hoped to reduce costs while maintaining its quality as it switched to being available solely online.
""And for Mustaqbal, there is a financial crisis. They mentioned it in all their mediums,"" he said, of the parent media organization that also includes a TV station. 
Lebanon has long enjoyed one of the freest and most diverse presses in the Arab world, with newspapers aligned with parties from across its political spectrum.
The Hariris are the most prominent political family from Lebanon's Sunni Muslim community. Saad al-Hariri has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since an election last year, with negotiations with rival factions continuing on a new power-sharing coalition.
""Al-Mustaqbal, between two generations"" was the newspaper's last front page headline after a run of 20 years since its founding, accompanied by an image of its 2005 edition after Rafik al-Hariri's assassination. 
Nounou said the headline referred to the effort to move from a print-focused generation to one that consumes news online. 

Thursday's edition included an editorial and a news story, followed by 30 pages of Mustaqbal front pages recording major news stories including the September 11 2001 attacks on the United States and 2008 factional fighting in Beirut.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Bill targeting 'yellow vest' 'hooligans' ignites French freedom debate,"By Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - French lawmakers have backed a bill banning protesters from hiding their faces during demonstrations, reinforcing President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to push back against violent members of the ""yellow vest"" movement.
The bill, which is expected to secure approval next week, also grants police greater powers to extract potential trouble-makers from demonstrations.
Addressing the lower house National Assembly, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner urged members to ""stop the brutes ... (who listen) only to their hunger for chaos"".
Opponents of the ""anti-casseurs"" (anti-hooligan) bill accused the government of impinging on civil liberties, with the debate exposing divisions within Macron's party, which has a comfortable majority in parliament.
The tactics used by police around the country have come under scrutiny, in particular the firing of ""flash ball"" riot guns, which have caused serious injuries, including at least one person blinded in one eye.
""We're not restricting freedoms, we're ensuring that freedoms can be guaranteed,"" Aurore Berger, a spokeswoman for Macron's La Republique En Marche party told BFM TV on Thursday, hours after the overnight vote. 
""We're not talking about any French citizen chosen at random, we're talking about those who have hurt others, those who want to kill and destroy property.""
By forbidding protesters from hiding their faces, the legislation aims to make it easier to use facial recognition technology to snare rioters. Anyone who masks their face could face a year in prison and a 15,000 euro fine. Critics say it will be impossible to enforce.
The ""yellow vest"" movement erupted in November as a grassroots protest against fuel taxes but has morphed into a broader revolt against inequality and Macron's presidency. It takes its name from the fluorescent vests motorists in France carry in their cars.
Rioters ran amok in Paris during the early street protests, torching cars, smashing luxury boutiques and defacing the Arc de Triomphe. It was among the worst violence the capital has experienced since a 1968 student uprising.
Violent clashes with police have persisted on the fringes of weekly marches in Paris, Toulouse, Bordeaux and other cities.
Lawmakers have now approved four key measures within the bill ahead of a vote on the overall package expected on Tuesday.
Since taking office in 2017, Macron has been criticized for curbing civil liberties. In early 2018, his government tightened asylum rules after a tense debate in parliament that led to cracks within his majority.
Charles de Courson of the Union des Democrates, Radicaux et Liberaux party (UDRL) told parliament it was unacceptable to deny individuals the right to protest because their behavior was deemed a threat to public order.

""Where are we heading? You might think we've returned to the Vichy regime!"" he said, referring to the wartime administration in unoccupied France that collaborated with the Nazis.

Serbia and its former province of Kosovo committed in 2013 to an EU-sponsored dialogue meant to resolve all issues between them, but little progress has been made.
Kosovo, which has a mainly ethnic Albanian population, seceded from Serbia in 2008 after a 1999 war in which NATO struck Serbian forces accused of carrying out atrocities during a campaign against Kosovo rebels.
Relations between them worsened late last year when Kosovo imposed 100 percent import duties on Serbian goods. The move came in a response to Belgrade's efforts to prevent Kosovo from joining international bodies including the United Nations. 
On Dec 14, Trump sent letters both to Vucic and Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci, urging them to reach a deal.
Vucic, a former Serbian ultra-nationalist who has switched to a pro-Western stance, is committed to bringing Serbia into the European Union, which has demanded that Belgrade first resolve its differences with Kosovo.
The government of Vucic has been the target of weeks of street demonstrations from opponents, some of whom accuse him of selling out Serbia's interests to join the West.
In the letter to Trump, Vucic said Kosovo import duties remained ""a burden and an insurmountable obstacle for the continuation of the dialogue."" 
Both the EU and United States have urged Kosovo to scrap import tariffs, but Pristina has so far refused.
""I want to stress ... that the very moment when Pristina annuls that senseless and damaging measure, we are ready to resume dialogue,"" Vucic said in the letter to Trump. 
Serbia, its allies Russia and China, as well as five EU member states remain opposed to Kosovo independence.
According to its Chamber of Commerce, Serbia could suffer around 250 million euros or around 0.7 percent of its gross domestic product in annual damage due to Kosovo import tariffs.

Vucic also invited Trump to be the first U.S. President to visit Serbia in more than 40 years.

The Sea-Watch 3, run by a German humanitarian group, docked in the port of Catania to disembark the 47 people, including 15 minors, that it picked up on Jan. 19.
After hugging crew members, the minors disembarked first. The migrants then boarded buses taking them to shelters where they would be able to make official asylum requests.
It was the second time in a month that the Sea Watch has been forced to spend several days at sea while European Union countries haggled over who would welcome migrants. 
Italy had been taking in all boat migrants picked up from unsafe and overcrowded boats off the coast of Libya until a populist government took over last year and shut the ports. 
This latest group will be redistributed among eight different member states, including Italy.
""We hope Europe can welcome them and allow them to live the lives they deserve,"" Sea Watch said on Twitter. 
After Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Wednesday called for the charity to be put under criminal investigation, Sea Watch also asked for help with potential legal costs.
""We hope for the best and prepare for the worst,"" it said on Twitter.
Salvini, who heads the nationalist League party, warned that Italy's ports would remain closed to humanitarian vessels.
""If another big boat comes illegally to the Italian coast, I'd do the same thing all over again,"" he told reporters in parliament on Wednesday. 
""If someone were interested in opening an investigation into possible irregularities committed by the non-governmental groups, I'd be happy,"" Salvini added.
Sea Watch said it followed international law at all times, and the prosecutor from the nearby city of Syracuse, where the Sea Watch ship had moored to take shelter from bad weather for several days, said the charity had done nothing wrong. 
Salvini was placed under investigation last August for alleged abuse of power and holding people against their will after he denied permission for the Italian coastguard ship Diciotti to let a group of mainly Eritrean migrants disembark.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a return to ""unity and harmony"" on Thursday as he welcomed gas-rich Qatar's emir to Beijing, amid a dispute that has seen some Arab states led by Saudi Arabia severing relations with Doha.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017. They accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and cultivating ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe, Iran.
Qatar, which denies the charge, says the boycott seeks to curtail its sovereignty, while the row has defied mediation efforts by Kuwait and the United States which sees Gulf unity as essential to containing Iran.
The rift has shown no sign of being resolved soon. Qatar has been bolstering ties with its supporters, such as Turkey, with trade between those two expected to have risen by more than half in 2018.
China has largely stayed out of the dispute, calling for the problem to be resolved via talks, though has played host to senior Qatari officials since the spat began, including in December to Qatar's foreign minister.
Meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi told Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that regional cooperation was an important basis for prosperity in the Gulf region, Chinese state television reported.
China supports the efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council to seek an ""appropriate resolution to disputes and contradictions via political and diplomatic means, to return unity and harmony between Gulf and Arab countries"", Xi said.
""China is willing to continue to play a constructive role according to the wishes of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries,"" Xi added, according to the report, which did not make direct mention of the Gulf rift.
""OLD FRIEND""
In remarks in front of reporters, Xi called Al Thani ""an old friend and a good friend"".
Al Thani told Xi that he was very happy with their personal friendship.
""We are ready to have bigger investments in China, in infrastructure or in any other field we see as important for us,"" he said.
""We are happy to provide China with liquid gas and we are ready to provide China with more in the near future. I am very happy to be in China.""
Last October, state energy giant Qatar Petroleum said it had signed a five-year agreement to supply China with 600,000 tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) per year.
Qatar's state news agency said Al Thani and Xi had signed memorandums of understanding on diplomatic training, future trade delegations, and the creation of a road map for Qatar to take part in China's Belt and Road initiative, an expansion of infrastructure and trade links worldwide.
Earlier in January, state-owned Qatar Airways said it had acquired a 5 percent stake in China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines, in a move to gain access to the fast-growing Chinese market.
China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil, but it has been trying to raise its profile, especially in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia's King Salman visited Beijing in 2017.

However, China has had to walk a fine line, as it also has close ties with both Iran and Israel.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Pheu Thai Party, which was ousted from power by the military in a 2014 coup, on Thursday picked a close ally of fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra as its main candidate for prime minister in elections set for March 24.
Pheu Thai's Sudarat Keyuraphan could face off against current military junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha in the election, although Prayuth has not yet said he will accept the nomination of a pro-military party that wants him on its ticket.
Prayuth is scheduled to make a speech on Friday outlining the successes of the junta's nearly five years in power.
Veteran politician Sudarat, 57, is a longtime Thaksin ally who helped found his now-defunct Thai Rak Thai Party, a predecessor to Pheu Thai.
""I have accepted the leadership role. Now I am ready to go into the contest to become prime minister,"" Sudarat told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Thursday.
""I am sure that Pheu Thai will win this election,"" she added.
Parties loyal to Thaksin have won every election in Thailand since 2001. Thaksin was overthrown by the military in 2006, and his sister Yingluck was ousted as prime minister in 2014. Both are now fugitives after being convicted of corruption and negligence.
Sudarat told Reuters on Wednesday that the party would abide by electoral laws passed by the junta that forbid Thaksin from influencing the campaign.
""He (Thaksin) knows that if he interferes then the party could risk getting dissolved, so he has been staying clear,"" she said.
Thailand's military-backed constitution and election law stipulate that political parties can nominate up to three candidates for the prime minister. All parties must register their prime minister candidates with the Election Commission between Feb. 4 and 8.
While Sudarat is the top name, the other two Pheu Thai candidates are former Transport Minister Chatchart Sittipan, 52, and former justice minister Chaikasem Sitisiri, 70.
Pheu Thai's main opponent, the pro-military Palang Pracharat Party, has said it will nominate junta leader Prayuth as its leading candidate. Prayuth must now decided whether to accept that nomination.
""I still have time before Feb. 8, but I am glad,"" Prayuth told reporters on Thursday.
Prayuth was the army chief who seized power from Yingluck Shinawatra's elected government in 2014 after prolonged street protests by pro-establishment forces that said her populist policies were bankrupting the state coffers.

He later took the title of prime minister and retired from the military.

About 23,000 people fleeing fighting in Deir al-Zor between Islamic State and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance, led by the Kurdish YPG militia, have arrived at al-Hol camp during the period, swelling its population, it said.
""The situation in Al-Hol camp is heartbreaking. Children are dying from hypothermia as their families flee to safety,"" Elizabeth Hoff, WHO representative in Syria, said in a statement.
The United Nations agency appealed for unhindered access to the camp, saying the situation has become ""critical"" for 33,000 people, mainly women and children, now living there in bitterly cold winter conditions. 
Many displaced had walked for days or traveled in open trucks, arriving malnourished and exhausted following ""years of deprivation"" living under control of Islamic State, it said.
""Thousands of new arrivals have been forced to spend several nights in the camp's open-air reception and screening areas, without tents, blankets or heating,"" the WHO added.
WHO-supported teams are working around the clock in the camp to screen new arrivals, support vaccination and refer severely malnourished children to a hospital in al-Hasakah, it said.
""Humanitarian access to the camp and surrounding roads is hampered by bureaucratic obstacles and security constraints,"" it added, appealing to all parties to provide unhindered access for life-saving aid.

NAIROBI/MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - The bomber who blew himself up outside a Nairobi hotel this month, launching an attack that killed 21 people, was already so well-known to Kenyan police that they had emblazoned his face across billboards under the slogan ""WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE"".
Mahir Khalid Riziki was barely 20 when he joined a radical Islamist cell that assassinated police in his home town of Mombasa, officers said. His mosque in the coastal Kenyan city funneled recruits to the Somalia-based Islamist group al Shabaab, which claimed the Jan. 15 attack in Nairobi. 
Riziki, who was 25 when he died, fled after a deadly police raid on the mosque in 2014. His years as a fugitive shed light on the difficulties of tracking militant suspects across East Africa at a time when al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab is seeking to broaden its pool of recruits and carry out more attacks in other nations.
Borders are porous. Intelligence sharing is often ad hoc. Warnings may be too vague or too late. 
Riziki's journey spanned at least two East African nations that share borders with Kenya.
""After he disappeared, we monitored him to Tanzania, then later to Somalia, where he went quiet until he made a surprise appearance in the Dusit (hotel) attack,"" a retired Kenyan counter-terrorism officer told Reuters. 
Like others interviewed, he did not want to be identified discussing an ongoing investigation.
Kenyan authorities did not respond to queries about whether they had requested help tracking Riziki. But the retired officer said they had contacted Interpol, the international police network. 
Interpol had no red notice - an international alert - for Riziki on its website. A spokesman declined to say why, citing a policy not to discuss specific cases. Tanzanian authorities also would not comment on Riziki's case. 
Somali intelligence officials told Reuters they usually received little information from Kenya. But they said they warned Kenya in November about a plot to attack an unknown target involving five men - the same number who attacked the Nairobi hotel and surrounding offices. 
Kenya did not want to pay for information, one Somali official said, and it was not possible to get more details from sources within al Shabaab without money.
MILITANT MOSQUE 
Slender, chisel-faced Riziki often prayed at Mombasa's Musa mosque, a newly renovated building whose green and white minaret is surrounded by a jumble of small shops. The mosque was a hotbed of extremism in the lead-up to the 2014 raid, authorities said, although now the leadership has changed. 
Kenyan police said Riziki was influenced by two of the mosque's former imams, Sheikh Aboud Rogo and Abubakar Sharif, also known as Makaburi, who they said recruited for al Shabaab.
Rogo was shot dead in 2012, Sharif in 2014. Supporters blamed police. Police denied it. 
Yusuf Mohammed, a 54-year-old shopkeeper, occasionally attended the mosque with Riziki. He said the young man was dazzled by its leaders, even as their extremism repelled more moderate Muslims. 
""He with many other youth really idolized Rogo and loved his preachings,"" Mohammed told Reuters. ""They spoke about him all the time."" 
Investigators believe Riziki met his recruiter, Ramadhan Hamisi Kufungwa, at the mosque. 
Kafungwa is a ""rising star in extremist circles"" and has been linked to another plot in Kenya - a plan to kidnap foreign tourists over the 2014 Christmas holiday - said a Nairobi-based security analyst who has observed militant activity at the mosque for nearly a decade. 
Riziki joined a gang targeting policemen, according to a summary of his file shared by Kenyan police. He took part in the killings of at least two officers in October 2014, the former Kenyan counter-terrorism officer said.
The next month, police raided the mosque. One officer died after his throat was cut during the operation. A suspected militant was killed, and 13 others were arrested. Riziki was there but escaped, the former officer said. He never returned, said Mohammed, the shopkeeper. 
SUSPECT ON THE RUN
Investigators believe Riziki spent much of the following years in Tanzania. It's not clear what he did there. Tanzanian police did not respond to requests for comment. 
Kenya, Tanzania and Somalia did not do a good job sharing information on militants, according to an international official who worked on counter-terrorism in the region.
A former senior Somali intelligence official conceded that information sharing ""is not always systematic"" and often depends on personal relationships between officials. 
""But it happens,"" the official said, citing two examples where Kenyan authorities detained and extradited militants at Somalia's request, despite the lack of a treaty between the two countries. 
Young, Kenyan and on the run, Riziki made the ideal al Shabaab attacker, said Matt Bryden, who heads the Nairobi-based think-tank, Sahan Research. 
""Al Shabaab is branching out; its profile now looks a lot more like al Qaeda in East Africa used to than the principally Somali organization it was for many years,"" he said.
Local recruits are less likely to attract suspicion in their home countries. But they also make al Shabaab vulnerable to infiltration - by foreign intelligence agencies and the group's Islamic State rivals. So these recruits are usually earmarked for suicide missions, the Somali intelligence official told Reuters.
The attackers spent several weeks late last year training in Boni forest, a thickly wooded area on the Kenyan side of the border where al Shabaab has carried out several attacks, including beheadings, said a Kenya security source and a Somali intelligence official. 
Riziki had earlier entered Somalia, where the militants control territory which government forces cannot enter, making it hard to track him.
Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency has also been hampered by infighting and personnel changes, insiders said. It has had three leaders in the past two years and been without a director general for the last four months. 
Some Somali regional security agencies are reluctant to work with the central authorities because of political tensions between the central government and Somalia's federal states, and because senior al Shabaab defectors hold prominent positions in the agency. 
""It is full of double agents. We cannot work with them,"" one Somali regional spy master told Reuters. 
A senior Somali intelligence official said his agency passed on a warning about a pending attack in Kenya in late November. 
""We told them: five guys,"" he said. ""They want to attack in Nairobi or Mombasa, like a hotel, tourist attraction or church.""
But such warnings are common and difficult to act on without more detail. Riziki's name was not mentioned, so he didn't raise any alarms when he returned to Kenya on Jan. 13. Police said he went through the border town of El Wak and took a bus to Nairobi. 

Two days later, he strolled into the gardens of the hotel complex. He stood in the sunshine for nearly a minute. Then he exploded.

In an interview with Fox News Channel, Pompeo said the North Koreans had agreed the second summit between the two leaders would be held at the end of February.
""We'll do it some place in Asia,"" he said.
""I am dispatching a team there. They're headed that way now to lay the foundations for what I hope will be a substantial additional step toward the path for not only denuclearization of the peninsula but a brighter future for the North Korean people,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo did not name the summit venue. Vietnam said last week it had not been informed about any time or venue for a possible Trump-Kim summit, but that it was confident in its ability to host such a meeting.
Officials and diplomats said two weeks ago that Vietnam was keen to host the summit and two sources told Reuters that Hanoi was preparing to receive Kim on a state visit. 
Singapore, where Trump and Kim met in June, and Bangkok have also been talked about as possibilities for a summit.
Last June's summit - the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader - produced a vague commitment by Kim to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but he has yet to take what Washington sees as concrete steps in that direction.
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency cited a South Korean foreign ministry official as saying the two sides would focus on how the United States might respond if the North dismantled its Yongbyon nuclear complex, in preparatory talks for a second summit.
During an inter-Korean summit in September, North Korea's Kim expressed willingness to close Yongbyon if the United States took corresponding action.
Yonhap said the preparatory talks could begin next week.
Possible U.S. reciprocal steps could include talks to clinch a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, the official was quoted as saying.
The war ended with an armistice and North Korea has long sought a formal treaty.
But the South Korean official ruled out the possibility of easing sanctions on North Korea or a resumption of economic projects between the two Koreas.

Last week, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that North Korea could show its commitment to denuclearization by shutting its Yongbyon complex and allowing international inspections to confirm that.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union can offer Britain more assurances over the Irish border 'backstop' in a political declaration on post-Brexit ties if London moves toward accepting a permanent customs union, a leading EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit said.
Danuta Hubner spoke to Reuters as British Prime Minister Theresa May headed back to Brussels to demand the renegotiation of the legal withdrawal treaty she agreed with the EU but cannot get ratified at home.
May wants to replace the emergency Irish border fix with unspecified ""alternative arrangements"" to ensure no return of extensive border checks on the island of Ireland, something the EU says is vague and not enough of a guarantee. 
""'Alternative arrangements'...relates to the future. What can be added or changed in the political declaration is to ensure some new arrangements that would solve the issue of a hard border,"" Hubner said on Wednesday evening.
""Key to this is the conversation with Corbyn. Cross-party dialogue must yield some new elements for the future...The only thing we have not yet tried is a shift of the UK's red lines,"" she said of May's talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Corbyn wants Britain to be in a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, something May has opposed so far as it would hinder Britain's ability to pursue independent trade deals around the world.
""If there is no openness on the UK side to include those assurances in the political declaration on the future EU-UK ties, the process could mechanically take us to no-deal.""
The political declaration is a non-legally binding document that accompanies the legally binding withdrawal deal negotiated by the EU and May's government. The British parliament resoundingly rejected that deal two weeks ago and has told May to reopen negotiations with the EU on it.
Hubner said the EU would not blink on refusing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement or replacing the backstop.
""A step further would risk undermining the single market. If the single market loses its integrity, it would be the end of the EU,"" she said. ""It's not just about Ireland.""

""The risk of no-deal Brexit has grown.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Russia will host the Taliban and Afghan politicians opposed to President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday, Russian and Taliban sources said, promoting its role of power broker in what a U.S. official called an attempt to ""muddle"" the U.S.-backed peace process.
Moscow snubbed the Afghan government, sources said, to ensure the participation of the Taliban who refuse to hold talks with Ghani's representatives to end the 17-year-old Afghan war, branding them puppets of the United States.
""Senior Taliban leaders and prominent Afghan politicians will travel to Moscow for a day-long summit. At this sensitive stage, it was best to not have Afghan government officials at the table,"" said a Russian official on condition of anonymity.
The Russian Embassy in Kabul was not available for comment.
The Moscow talks underline the increasing role Russia is playing in Afghanistan, decades after Soviet forces withdrew from the country, with business investment plans, diplomatic and cultural outreach and small military support for the central government.
Thy also come as the Afghan government is struggling to recover control of districts lost to the Taliban.
The latest quarterly report by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction noted that the control of Afghanistan's territory and population ""became somewhat more contested (and) Afghan government control or influence continued to decline"". 
The news of Russia hosting Ghani's critics, including former President Hamid Karzai who believes Russia can play a decisive role in ending America’s longest war, has angered Kabul and U.S. officials. 
""Russia is again trying to muddle the U.S.-backed peace process and the political situation of Afghanistan,"" said a senior U.S. official, adding that Russia's repeated overtures toward the Taliban and Ghani's critics proved its determination to belittle the government.
Prominent outspoken critics of Ghani, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Mohammad Ismail Khan and Atta Mohammad Noor, who fought against the Soviets after their 1979 invasion, will travel to Moscow.
Sohail Shahin, a spokesman for the Taliban political office in Qatar, said a delegation led by Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, a senior political leader, would travel to Moscow for what he said would be a two-day meeting.
Last November, Moscow hosted a multilateral summit to try to find ways to end the war, drawing delegates from a body appointed by the Western-backed government, the Taliban and officials from a dozen nations, including the United States.
Analysts said Russia wants to maintain good relations with the Taliban, who are fighting to restore strict Islamic rule after their 2001 ouster.
""Russia knows that Ghani's government was established with American support that is why they are not giving importance to it,"" said Wadir Safi, a political science professor at Kabul University.
""The Moscow meeting can cause hurdles to the ongoing peace talks if it is not in close cooperation with the U.S peace efforts.""
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in January her country welcomed Washington’s peace initiative, but U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad’s attempts to convince the Taliban to sit down to talks with the Kabul government have failed.
The United States has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission and a separate counter-terrorism effort largely directed at groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.
The next round of peace talks between Khalizad and the Taliban's newly appointed political leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, is scheduled for Qatar on Feb. 25.

The 5-Star created a coalition government last June with Berlusconi's traditional ally the League after the center-right failed to win a majority in national elections.
However, Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia (Go Italy!), told Corriere della Sera daily that a new majority could be shaped in parliament if his party joined forces with the League, the far-right Brothers of Italy and some 5-Star dissidents.
The center-right fell some 50 seats short of a majority in the lower house and political analysts have always questioned previous assertions by Berlusconi that he could find the numbers needed to win a vote of confidence.
""We are ready (to face new elections). However many think that if this government fell apart, a new majority would emerge, different from the current one and able to support a center-right government without going back to the ballot box. We'll see,"" Berlusconi was quoted as saying.
Tensions have recently been rising between the League and 5-Star over an array of issues and many newspapers have speculated that the coalition will not survive the year.

Adding to the government's problems, 5-Star recently expelled two senators from the party last month, weakening its fragile majority in the upper house.

LONDON (Reuters) - On a cold, grey Sunday morning, in a street lined with shuttered builders' yards and storage units, songs of prayer in the West African language of Yoruba ring out from a former warehouse that is now a church.
The congregation, almost entirely dressed in white robes, steadily grows to around 70 people as musicians playing drums, a keyboard and a guitar pick up the pace of the hymns. Some women prostrate themselves on the floor in prayer.
In the sparse formerly industrial building, its interior brightened by touches of gold paint, a speaker reminds the group of a list of banned activities -- no smoking, no drinking of alcohol, no practicing of black magic.
In a street outside, a pastor flicks holy water over the car of a woman who wants a blessing to ward off the risk of accidents.
The busy scene at the Celestial Church of Christ is repeated at a half a dozen other African Christian temples on the same drab street and in the adjacent roads - one corner of the thriving African church community in south London.
Around 250 black majority churches are believed to operate in the borough of Southwark, where 16 percent of the population identifies as having African ethnicity.
Southwark represents the biggest concentration of African Christians in the world outside the continent with an estimated 20,000 congregants attending churches each Sunday, according to researchers at the University of Roehampton.
Reflecting the different waves of migration to Britain in the 20th Century, Caribbean churches began to appear in the late 1940s and 1950s as workers and their families arrived from Jamaica and other former British colonies.
African churches opened their doors in London from the 1960s, followed by a second wave in the 1980s.
Migrants, many of them from Nigeria and Ghana, sought to build communities and maintain cultural connections with their home countries by founding their own churches, often founded in private homes, schools and office spaces.
As the communities grew, the churches moved into bigger spaces in bingo halls, cinemas and warehouses, gathering congregations of up to 500 people where services are streamed online by volunteers with video cameras.
There is a striking contrast with the empty pews at many traditional Church of England churches where congregations have dwindled for years.
""We pray for this country,"" said Abosede Ajibade, a 54-year-old Nigerian who moved to Britain in 2002 and works for an office maintenance company. 
""People here brought Christianity to Africa but it doesn't feel like they serve Jesus Christ any more.""
Anyone traveling around south London on a Sunday morning will see worshippers, often dressed in dazzlingly colored African clothes, making their way to churches, each with their different styles of worship.
Hymns are sung only in African languages in some temples, or only in English at others. Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the English Channel. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.
But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.
""That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,"" Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theater.
""The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,"" Adeleke said. ""It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.""
For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.
But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbors: Some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.
Andrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, said pastors had to juggle retaining the churches' African identity while appealing to children of first generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.
They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.
Rogers recalled speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.
""If the church doesn't adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,"" Rogers said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will direct more foreign aid to develop the sport of rugby league in the Pacific, officials say, bolstering a soft power offensive against China's growing influence in the region. 
The plan, backed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, aims to tap into a shared passion for the bruising game by funding more coaching clinics and exhibition matches on far-flung Pacific islands being wooed by China. 
""The prime minister sees rugby league as a central component of his soft-power plan as China's influence in the Pacific grows,"" said a senior rugby league official who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to talk about the plan.
Declaring the Pacific ""our patch"", Australia is stepping up its diplomatic and trade efforts in the region, uneasy at China's bid for influence through infrastructure loans and its version of soft power - ""ping pong"" diplomacy. 
China's encouragement has helped table tennis, or ping-pong, gain a foothold in Papua New Guinea (PNG), but it is unlikely to challenge the island's love affair with league rugby.
Such is the region's passion for the game that when Australia played a friendly match in PNG in 2016, thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the visitors.
League-obsessed fans also follow their players in Australia, where athletes of Pacific island or Maori descent made up 44 percent of National Rugby League (NRL) rosters in 2017. 
Australia's Pacific Outreach Programme, which includes schemes developed along with the NRL, will expand to include smaller but strategically important islands, officials said. 
""Together with the government we have plans to expand into the Cook Islands, Niue and Vanuatu,"" said Frank Puletua, senior manager of international strategy at the NRL.
The three island nations have signed up to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which promotes expanding land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars for infrastructure development.
The NRL already runs programs in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, all of which have joined Belt and Road.
'PASSION'
In response to China's investment push, Australia has promised Pacific neighbors up to A$3 billion ($2.16 billion) in cheap infrastructure loans and grants, but the new fund is not expected to be operational until July.
Unable to match China's deeper pockets and its willingness to fund projects that Australia will not - such as a new road in PNG - Australia has dialled up a playbook that promotes its cultural ties with the region.
It expanded a Pacific jobs scheme that allows men and women from several island nations to work in Australia.
Morrison, on a tour of the Pacific, also promised to relax curbs on imports of Kava - a mildly intoxicating brew that is deeply embedded in the social fabric of Pacific islanders.
During a trip to Fiji, Morrison said his government would pay the travel costs for a Fijian rugby league team to compete in the second tier of Australia's national competition, joining a team from PNG that has competed since 2013.
The NRL also plans a series of pre-season games in the Pacific region.
""One thing we have greatly in common is our passion for sport,"" Morrison said in Fiji's capital Suva. 

""Our shared passion has a practical element to the relationship between our countries.""

KABUL (Reuters) - The strength of the embattled Afghan defense forces has declined to its lowest level in four years, a U.S. watchdog said on Thursday, as talks between Washington and the Taliban continue over the possible withdrawal of foreign troops.
The negotiations, due to resume in Qatar on Feb. 25, are centered on a possible ceasefire and the withdrawal of thousands of U.S.-led NATO forces. Many obstacles remain before that would be possible but an eventual pullout would place the Afghan defense forces under even more pressure.
The latest quarterly report by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) noted that the control of Afghanistan's territory and population ""became somewhat more contested (and) Afghan government control or influence continued to decline"".
It put districts under government control or influence at 53.8 per cent covering 63.5 percent of the population by October 2018, with the rest of the country controlled or contested by the Taliban.
The hardline Islamist group has been unable to seize a major Afghan city but has stepped up pressure in rural areas and is now more powerful than any at other time since they were toppled by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in late 2001.
SIGAR cited a U.S. Forces-Afghanistan report that the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces had decreased to 308,693 troops, or 87.7 per cent of its assigned strength, the lowest since the creation of NATO's operation to train, advise and assist Afghans in January 2015.
The United States has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission and a separate counter-terrorism effort largely directed at groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.
Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries also participate in Resolute Support.
The report did not detail the reasons for the decreasing numbers and the Afghan government does not publish casualty figures. However, security analysts say that re-enlistment and unauthorized absences remain major problems.
President Ashraf Ghani said in Switzerland last week 45,000 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed since he took office in 2014, a figure analysts said helped explain morale problems.
""That number indicates that in those roughly 53 months, around 849 Afghan security personnel have been killed per month on average,"" SIGAR said.
SIGAR also released figures suggesting the recruitment and retention of women in the national defense and security forces was a significant challenge.

Citing information declassified by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, SIGAR said Afghan forces had 4,735 female personnel - less than 2 per cent of current assigned strength.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has ended a sweeping crackdown on corruption ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that it said had recovered more than $106 billion through settlements with scores of senior princes, ministers and top businessmen.
A royal court said in a statement on Wednesday authorities had summoned 381 people, some as witnesses, under the campaign launched in November 2017, but it provided no names. 
It said 87 people confessed to charges against them and reached settlements that included the forfeiture of real estate, companies, cash and other assets.
The campaign ended as abruptly as it began, despite speculation in the business community that a new round of arrests was imminent.
The public prosecutor refused to settle the cases of 56 people due to existing criminal charges against them. Eight more who declined settlement offers stand accused of corruption, the court said.
Detainees who were not indicted were freed, but it was unclear when travel bans, bank freezes and electronic monitoring of at least some of those released earlier would end.
For the first three months of the campaign, many members of the kingdom's economic and political elite were held in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, with some later moved to a prison. 
Some detainees were reportedly tortured, which the authorities have denied.
Critics called it a shakedown and power play by Prince Mohammed. It unsettled some foreign investors that he is courting to diversify the economy away from oil.
The October killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate tarnished the crown prince's reputation in the West and intensified criticism of Riyadh's human rights record and its role in the Yemen war.
Prince Mohammed has defended the anti-corruption campaign as ""shock therapy"" as he tries to overhaul the economy.
His social reforms, including the easing of restrictions such as bans on cinemas and women driving, have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the arrests of dozens of clerics, women's rights activists and intellectuals.
SIGNAL GOVERNMENT 'WANTS TO MOVE ON'
Karen Young, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said it was hard to say if the campaign had been successful.
""The good news is that the government seems to be signaling that it wants to move on,"" she said. ""On Saudi foreign policy and domestic politics, particularly toward citizen activists, there is still deep apprehension in the West.""
Ali Shihabi, head of the Arabia Foundation in Washington which regularly supports Saudi policy, said the end of the campaign reflected a government attempt to address international criticism of a lack of due process and transparency.
""Now critics will bemoan lack of names and details on each case but we must remember that individuals themselves have no desire to be named,"" he said.
The figures released on Wednesday were little different from those the government announced in its last update, exactly one year earlier.
It is unclear how much of the money it says was recovered has actually reached state coffers. 
Only a month ago, the finance minister told Reuters the authorities had collected some $13 billion from settlements in 2018 and expected a similar amount this year.
The initial sweep netted cousins of Prince Mohammed, such as billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, National Guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah.
Miteb was freed within weeks after agreeing to pay more than $1 billion to settle corruption allegations against him, a Saudi official said at the time. 
Two months later, Alwaleed settled after reaching what he called ""a confirmed understanding between me and the government"". Turki has not been heard from.
Also detained were senior officials, including ousted economy minister Adel Fakieh, who is believed to be in detention, and former chief of the royal court, Khalid al-Tuwaijri.
Top businessmen were held alongside them. Waleed al-Ibrahim and Saleh Kamel were released early on, while others including Amr Dabbagh and Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi only got out this month. The fate of Bakr bin Laden, released temporarily last week, remains unclear.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>",China's military-run space station in Argentina is a 'black box',"By Cassandra Garrison
LAS LAJAS, Argentina - When China built a military-run space station in Argentina's Patagonian region it promised to include a visitors' center to explain the purpose of its powerful 16-story antenna.
The center is now built - behind the 8-foot barbed wire fence that surrounds the entire space station compound. Visits are by appointment only. 
Shrouded in secrecy, the compound has stirred unease among local residents, fueled conspiracy theories and sparked concerns in the Trump administration about its true purpose, according to interviews with dozens of residents, current and former Argentine government officials, U.S. officials, satellite and astronomy specialists and legal experts. 
The station's stated aim is peaceful space observation and exploration and, according to Chinese media, it played a key role in China’s landing of a spacecraft on the dark side of the moon in January.
But the remote 200-hectare compound operates with littleoversight by the Argentine authorities, according to hundreds of pages of Argentine government documents obtained by Reuters and reviewed by international law experts. (For an interactive version of this story: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TlXEMj)
President Mauricio Macri's former foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, said in an interview that Argentina has no physical oversight of the station's operations. In 2016, she revised the China space station deal to include a stipulation it be for civilian use only.
The agreement obliges China to inform Argentina of its activities at the station but provides no enforcement mechanism for authorities to ensure it is not being used for military purposes, the international law experts said.
""It really doesn't matter what it says in the contract or in the agreement,"" said Juan Uriburu, an Argentine lawyer who worked on two major Argentina-China joint ventures. ""How do you make sure they play by the rules?""
""I would say that, given that one of the actors involved in the agreements reports directly to the Chinese military, it is at least intriguing to see that the Argentine government did not deal with this issue with greater specificity,"" he said.
China's space program is run by its military, the People's Liberation Army. The Patagonian station is managed by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC), which reports to the PLA's Strategic Support Force. 
Beijing insists its space program is for peaceful purposes and its foreign ministry in a statement stressed the Argentine station is for civilian use only. It said the station was open to the public and media. 
""The suspicions of some individuals have ulterior motives,"" the ministry said.
Asked how it ensures the station is not used for military purposes, Argentina's space agency CONAE said the agreement between the two countries stated their commitment to ""peaceful use"" of the project.
It said radio emissions from the station were also monitored, but radio astronomy experts said the Chinese could easily hide illicit data in these transmissions or add encrypted channels to the frequencies agreed upon with Argentina. 
CONAE also said it had no staff permanently based at the station, but they made ""periodic"" trips there. 
SPYING CONCERNS
The United States has long been worried about what it sees as China's strategy to ""militarize"" space, according to one U.S. official, who added there was reason to be skeptical of Beijing's insistence that the Argentine base was strictly for exploration.
Other U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters expressed similar concerns.
“The Patagonia ground station, agreed to in secret by a corrupt and financially vulnerable government a decade ago, is another example of opaque and predatory Chinese dealings that undermine the sovereignty of host nations,” said Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
Some radio astronomy experts said U.S. concerns were overblown and the station was probably as advertised - a scientific venture with Argentina - even if its 35-meter diameter dish could eavesdrop on foreign satellites. 
Tony Beasley, director of the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory, said the station could, in theory, ""listen"" to other governments' satellites, potentially picking up sensitive data. But that kind of listening could be done with far less sophisticated equipment.
“Anyone can do that. I can do that with a dish in my back yard, basically,"" Beasley said. ""I don't know that there's anything particularly sinister or troubling about any part of China's space radio network in Argentina.""
Argentine officials have defended the Chinese station, saying the agreement with China is similar to one signed with the European Space Agency, which built a station in a neighboring province. Both have 50-year, tax-free leases. Argentine scientists in theory have access to 10 percent of the antenna time at both stations.
The law experts who reviewed the documents said there is one notable difference: ESA is a civilian agency.
""All of the ESA governments play by democratic rules,"" Uriburu said. ""The party is not the state. But that’s not the case in China. The party is the state.""
In the United States, NASA, like the ESA, is a civilian agency, while the U.S. military has it own space command for military or national security missions. In some instances, NASA and the military have collaborated, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
""The line does blur sometimes,"" he said. ""But that's very much the exception."" 
BLACK BOX
In Las Lajas, a town of 7,000 people located about 40 minutes drive from the station, the antenna is a source of bewilderment and suspicion. 
""These people don't allow you access, they don't let you see,"" said shop owner Alfredo Garrido, 51. ""My opinion is that it is not a scientific research base, but rather a Chinese military base.""
Among the wilder conspiracy theories reporters heard during a visit to the town: That the base was being used to build a nuclear bomb.
The drive from Las Lajas to the space station is barren and dusty. There are no signs indicating the station's existence. The sprawling antenna is suddenly visible after a curve in the gravel road off the main thoroughfare. The massive dish is the only sign of human life for miles around. 
The station became operational in April. Thirty Chinese employees work and live on site, which employs no locals, according to the Las Lajas mayor, Maria Espinosa, adding that the station has been good for the local economy.
Espinosa said she rented her house to Chinese space station workers before they moved to the base and had visited the site herself at least eight times. 
Others in Las Lajas said they rarely see anyone from the station in town, except when the staff make a trip to its Chinese supermarket. 
Reuters requested access to the station through CONAE, the local provincial government and China's embassy. CONAE said it was not able to approve a visit by Reuters in the short term but it was planning a media day.
It added that students from nearby towns have already visited the compound. 
NO OVERSIGHT 
When Argentina's Congress debated the space station in 2015, during the presidency of Cristina Fernandez, opposition lawmakers questioned why there was no stipulation that it only be for civilian use. Nonetheless, Congress approved the deal. 
When Macri took office in 2015 he was worried the space station agreement did not explicitly say it should be for civilian use only, said Malcorra, his then foreign minister, who flew to Beijing in 2016 to rework it.
Malcorra said she was constrained in her ability to revise it because it had already been signed by Fernandez. The Chinese, however, agreed to include the stipulation that it be for civilian use. She insisted on a press conference with her Chinese counterpart in Beijing to publicize this. 
""This was something I requested to make sure there was no doubt or no hidden agenda from any side here, and that our people knew that we had done this,"" she said from her home in Spain.
But it still fell short on one key point - oversight.
""There was no way we could do that after the level of recognition that this agreement had from our side. This was recognized, accepted and approved by Congress,"" Malcorra said. 
""I would have written the agreement in a different way,"" she added. ""I would have clauses that articulate the access to oversight.""
Malcorra said she was confident that Argentina could approach China for ""reassurances"" if there was ever any doubt about activities at the station. When asked how Argentina would know about those activities, she said, ""There will be some people who will tell us, don't worry.""
LOGGING VISITORS
The opaqueness of the station's operations and the reluctance of Argentine officials to talk about it makes it hard to determine who exactly has visited the compound. 
A provincial government official provided Reuters a list of local journalists who had toured the facility. A number appeared to have visited on a single day in February 2017, 14 months before it became operational, a review of their stories and social media postings showed.
Aside from Espinosa, the mayor of Las Lajas, no one else interviewed by Reuters in town had toured the station. Resident Matias Uran, 24, however, said his sister was among a group of students who visited last year. They saw a dining room and a games room, he said.
Alberto Hugo Amarilla, 60, who runs a small hotel in Las Lajas, recalled a dinner he attended shortly after construction began at the site.
There, he said, a Chinese official in town to visit the site greeted him enthusiastically. His fellow dinner guests told him the official had learned that Amarilla was a retired army officer.

The official, they said, was a Chinese general.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's two biggest mining firms on Thursday backed calls for an indigenous advisory body in parliament, saying Prime Minister Scott Morrison's opposition to the proposal did not ""stand up to scrutiny.""
Australia has struggled for decades to reconcile with descendants of first inhabitants, who arrived on the continent some 50,000 years before British colonists.
The opposition Labor party has promised a referendum on the advisory body if it wins a general election due by May. 
BHP Group and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) issued a statement in support of a constitutionally enshrined body to advise parliament on indigenous matters. 
""A first nations voice to parliament is a meaningful step toward reconciliation,"" BHP Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said. 
""It would empower indigenous Australians and it would make sure indigenous people have a say on the legislation, policy and programs that shape indigenous lives, families and communities,"" he added.
The constitution makes no reference to indigenous people, whose leaders have struggled for generations to gain recognition for past injustices since European colonization in the 1700s.
The government only issued a formal apology to indigenous people in 2008. 
Morrison's conservative government late last year rejected the proposed advisory body comprised of elected indigenous Australians, saying it would create a de facto third chamber in parliament.
""These fears don't stand up to scrutiny,"" Mackenzie said, referring to a 2017 report by indigenous leaders that recommended the advisory body. 
""The final report... found that there was nothing to fear from giving indigenous Australians the constitutionally-enshrined voice they deserve,"" he said. 
Australia's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
Morrison has angered indigenous people by refusing to consider moving the Australia Day national holiday, which they call ""Invasion Day"" because it marks the 1788 arrival of the British fleet. 
During a visit to Brisbane on Thursday, Morrison said he disagreed with the mining companies.

""I want to see indigenous families in jobs. I want to see indigenous kids safe and I want to see them in school because that's what gives them a bright future,"" he said.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2019 12:14AM ET</span>",Need for speed: Carts on rails help Manila's commuters dodge gridlock,"(This story has been refiled to fix editing credit)
By Ronn Bautista
MANILA (Reuters) - Thousands of commuters flock to Manila's railway tracks every day, but rather than boarding the trains, they climb on to wooden carts pushed along the tracks, to avoid the Philippine capital's infamous traffic gridlock. 
The trolleys, as the carts are known, most of them fitted with colorful umbrellas for shade from the sun, can seat up to 10 people each, who pay as little as 20 U.S. cents per ride, cheaper than most train rides.
""I do this because it gives us money that's easy to earn,"" said Reynaldo Diaz, 40, who is one of more than 100 operators, also known as ""trolley boys"", who push the carts along the 28-km (17-mile) track, most wearing flimsy flip-flops on their feet. 
""It's better than stealing from others,"" said Diaz, adding that he earned around $10 a day, just enough for his family to get by. A trolley boy since he was 17, he lives in a makeshift shelter beside the track with his two sons.
Diaz said the trolley boys were just ""borrowing"" the track from the Philippine National Railways, but the state-owned train company has moved to halt the trolley service after the media drew attention to its dangers recently. 
The risk arises because those pushing and riding the trolleys have to watch out for the trains to avoid collisions. 
""Of course we get scared of the trains,"" said Jun Albeza, 32, who has been a trolley boy for four years after he was laid off from plumbing and construction jobs. 
""That's why, whenever we're pushing these trolleys, we always look back, so we can see if there's a train coming. Those in front of us will give us a heads-up too.""
When a train approaches, the trolley boys quickly grab the lightweight carts off the track and jump out of the way along with their riders. 
Still, there have been no fatal accidents since the makeshift service started decades ago, some of the trolley boys told Reuters.  
A Manila police officer confirmed that records showed no casualties related to the trolley boys. 
""It is really dangerous and should not be allowed, But we understand that it's their livelihood,"" said the officer, Bryan Silvan. 
""They're like mushrooms that just popped up along the tracks and they even have their own association.""
When the Philippine National Railways began operation in the 1960s, its network of more than 100 stations extended to provinces outside Manila.
But neglect and natural disasters have since caused it to cut back operations by two-thirds, even as the capital's population has ballooned to about 13 million.
For office workers and students, the minutes shaved off daily commutes justify the risks of trolley rides. 
""The distance to our workplaces is actually shorter through this route,"" said one office worker, Charlette Magtrayo.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Senate hearings to probe unsafe housing of U.S. military families,"By Joshua Schneyer and M.B. Pell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Troubled by widespread health and safety hazards uncovered by a Reuters investigation into U.S. military housing, Congress will hold hearings next month to ensure that “what we’re seeing now can never happen again,” said Michigan Democrat Gary Peters, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
During the hearings, tentatively scheduled for Feb. 13, lawmakers will question the Department of Defense and private contractors who house thousands of U.S. military families on bases across the country, according to Senate staff familiar with the plans.
U.S. senators said the news articles and mounting complaints from military families demonstrate a need for immediate oversight.
Congress must do “all that we can ensure that no soldier, airman, sailor, Marine or their families have to worry about the safety of their homes,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said in a statement. His state is home to Fort Bragg, where families have signed a petition demanding improvements by their private landlord.
The hearings mark a growing bipartisan commitment from Congress to ensure the safety of 700,000 service members, spouses and children who live in homes operated by private companies on bases in partnerships with the Department of Defense.
“We look forward to engaging with Congress through productive discussions on privatized housing,” said Department of Defense spokeswoman Heather Babb.
The hearings come in response to a Reuters series that revealed a dark side of the U.S. Military Housing Privatization Initiative, the largest-ever corporate takeover of federal housing. Two decades ago, the Defense Department began turning over most family housing on U.S. bases to private companies to manage in an effort to improve living conditions.
In some homes, however, lead paint hazards threaten children; rampant mold sickens others; ceilings leak or collapse into bedrooms, and rodents soil cribs and carpets. Even some new homes are riddled with defects, and the housing often isn’t accessible to state or county inspectors. Families have limited tenant rights and can be left penniless or powerless to challenge property managers in business with their military employers.
Behind the safety lapses are private landlords with iron-clad assurances of profit from Defense Department rent stipends. One of them stands to earn $1 billion in fees from confidential Army housing contracts that last a half-century.
The DOD has long maintained that the privatization program vastly improved housing on U.S. bases. But since Reuters began publishing its reports, military families have pressed Congress to hold the military and contractors accountable for home safety lapses.
“This is a long time coming,” said Janna Driver, an Air Force spouse whose children were sickened by household mold on a base in Oklahoma. ""I think these articles are why these Congressional hearings are happening.""
More than 100 bases nationwide have privatized housing, leaving military branches with limited oversight. The program enlisted private firms to build and renovate homes and maintain high quality for the residents.
“If they aren’t getting it, we need to look at what the Department of Defense is doing to hold these contractors accountable,” said Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Its ranking member, Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, began calling for the housing hearings last month.
According to Inhofe, the Subcommittees on Personnel and Readiness will conduct the hearings. The scrutiny could help Congress consider legislative measures to boost safety and accountability in privatized on-base housing, Senate staff said.
Hearings represent the latest response to the Reuters reports. Measures announced earlier include a Government Accountability Office examination of base housing, an investigation by the Defense Department’s Inspector General, and a nationwide inspection program in Army homes for lead, mold and asbestos that could cost up to $386 million.

The housing concerns have also mobilized other senators. Last week, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein sent letters to the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, citing Reuters’ coverage and demanding contract documents for base housing in her state.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has decided to cut the number of diplomatic staff in Cuba by up to half after another person fell ill, Ottawa said on Wednesday, bringing the total to 14 Canadians suffering mysterious symptoms since 2017.
Canadian and U.S. diplomats in Havana first began complaining of dizziness, headaches and nausea in the spring of 2017. The United States reduced embassy staffing in Cuba to a maximum of 18 from more than 50 after more than two dozen personnel developed unusual illnesses.
Canada’s diplomatic staff in Cuba will drop to eight from 16, a Canadian government source said. 
""A further reduction in the (Canadian embassy) footprint is deemed to be the appropriate response,"" another Canadian government official told reporters.
The November incident was the first new Canadian case reported in months, leading to the decision to reduce the remaining staff. Spouses and dependents left last year.
The Cuban ambassador to Canada, Josefina Vidal, said in a statement that Havana considered Ottawa's decision ""incomprehensible,"" given it would not help solve the mystery of the health incidents and would hurt bilateral relations.
""This behavior favors those who in the United States use this issue to attack and denigrate Cuba,"" Vidal said.
The Cuban government has been cooperating with a Canadian investigation into the cause of the illnesses, which has not been determined.
""I think I can safely say the Cuban officials are as frustrated as we are that we cannot get any closer to determining a cause,"" the Canadian government official told reporters.
Vidal said there was no ""evidence that might reveal any brain damage, or that may explain the varied symptoms reported, or that may indicate that these symptoms had occurred due to the stay of the affected diplomats in Cuba.""
Cuba remains committed to maintaining good bilateral relations with Canada despite its decision on Wednesday, she wrote. 
More than a million Canadians visited the Caribbean island last year, making Canada Cuba's most important tourism market, as it has been for decades.
Canada is also among Cuba's 10 top trading partners, with Canada-Cuba trade totaling $790 million in 2017. It is Cuba's only trade partnership among those 10 countries where the trade balance is in Havana’s favor, according to the latest Cuban trade figures. 

That is due to a joint venture between Canadian company Sherritt International Corp and state nickel monopoly Cubaniquel, which produces about 60 percent of the island’s nickel plus cobalt, which is then shipped to a joint venture in Canada for refining.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 09:48PM ET</span>","Don't deal in Venezuelan gold, White House says, in anti-Maduro push","By Shaylim Castro and Jeff Mason
CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House warned traders on Wednesday not to deal in Venezuelan gold or oil following its imposition of stiff sanctions aimed at forcing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power.
National security adviser John Bolton tweeted that traders should not deal in gold, oil or other commodities ""being stolen"" from the Venezuelan people, as opponents of Maduro's government worried the government was surreptitiously moving to ship gold reserves abroad.
The White House said President Donald Trump spoke to Venezuela's self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, by phone on Wednesday, reiterating support for his ""fight to regain democracy.""
On one side of the tussle for control of Venezuela - an OPEC member with the world's largest oil reserves but in dire financial straits - Guaido and Western backers led by the United States are insisting on an immediate transition and fresh elections.
On the other, Maduro, with backing from Russia, China and Turkey, says he will remain for his second six-year term despite accusations of fraud in his re-election last year and the economic meltdown.
Venezuela's struggle to pay its debts even to allies Russia and China amid a sharp drop in oil output has been exacerbated by the new sanctions, which will make it very hard to sell oil to its main client, the United States. 
In that context, the arrival in Caracas of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 plane from Moscow on Monday led to speculation that Maduro's government was preparing to ship more gold reserves out of the country, following shipments of $900 million of gold to Turkey last year. That was part of a strategy to increase the central bank's liquidity.
The flight, operated by Russia's Nordwind Airlines, left Venezuela at 4:52 p.m., a Reuters witness said. Another Russian-operated flight, a Boeing 757 cargo plane, arrived at the airport an hour earlier via Cape Verde, according to publicly available flight data. There are no routine flights between the two countries.
Venezuelan lawmaker Jose Guerra, a former central bank economist, told the opposition-run National Assembly his understanding was that the Nordwind plane would take some gold reserves to Russia. 
However, a source with knowledge of the movements said that despite the rumors, gold was not due to leave on either of the Russian planes. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.
Sources told Reuters that private military contractors who do secret missions for Moscow were in Venezuela last week.
The recently appointed U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, said Washington was looking around the world for more assets of the Maduro government, including gold holdings and bank accounts.
The Kremlin said this week it expected Venezuela to pay its debts. Russia, which like China has loaned and invested billions of dollars to Venezuela, called on Guaido to drop his demand for a snap election and instead accept mediation.
But given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue between the government and opposition, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time.
Guaido's envoy to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, said the only dialogue they were interested in would be a negotiation for Maduro's departure and new elections. Government officials insist the next presidential election will be in 2025.
FRESH PROTESTS
Responding to a call by Guaido, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Venezuela on Wednesday, some waving Venezuelan flags while drivers of cars and buses honked in support.
""I want this government to go, it has been a total humiliation for the country,"" said Lucy Cordoba, 51, a government worker in the poor hillside town of Petare at the edge of Caracas, the capital, where she said trash had not been collected for a year and water was scarce. 
Cordoba said her children were among the more than 3 million Venezuelans who have left the country in the past couple of years. One went to Peru and another to the Dominican Republic. 
More than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the U.N. human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump and Guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after Venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to Guaido's arrest. Abrams said action against Guaido would be ""foolish."" 
Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions.
Bolton, the national security adviser, said he had a ""very productive meeting"" on Wednesday with the executive team of Citgo, the U.S.-based refining business of Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA, two days after Washington slapped sanctions on PDVSA.
Wills Rangel, a board member of PDVSA, told Reuters the company was having problems unloading fuel imports because the sanctions were complicating payments.
Maduro, 56, says Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. Maduro is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers and has made daily visits to troops.

""Do you want to be a coward?"" Maduro yelled in a call and response session with hundreds of soldiers on Wednesday. ""No, president,"" they shouted back.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A blast of icy polar air brought dangerously low temperatures to the U.S. Midwest on Wednesday, causing at least three more deaths while halting mail delivery and forcing residents who pride themselves on their winter hardiness to huddle indoors.
Classes were canceled for Wednesday and Thursday for students across the Midwest, including Chicago, home of the nation's third-largest school system, and police warned of the heightened risk of accidents on icy highways. Michigan said all state offices would remain closed through Thursday.
In a rare move, the U.S. Postal Service appeared to set aside its credo that ""neither snow nor rain ... nor gloom of night"" would stop its work as it suspended deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio.
At least a dozen deaths related to extreme cold weather have been reported since Saturday in Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, according to officials and media reports. 
Illinois State Police officers rescued 21 people who were stranded in a charter bus that broke down in sub-zero temperatures along Interstate 55 near Auburn after the vehicle's diesel fuel turned to gel in its engine, according to the agency. 
In Detroit, a 70-year-old man was found dead on Wednesday on a residential street, a Detroit police spokeswoman said. About 15 miles (24 km) south in the community of Ecorse, a former city councilman in his 70s and dressed only in sleepwear was also found dead on Wednesday, police there said.
A University of Iowa student was found dead outside a building at the campus early on Wednesday, the school said in a statement. The death of Gerald Belz, a pre-med student, was believed to be weather-related.
Streets in Chicago were nearly empty, with few people walking outside in the painfully cold air as temperatures hovered around 18 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius).
""It's terrible!"" Pasquale Cappellano, a 68-year-old waiter, said as he smoked a cigarette while waiting outside for a bus on Chicago's North Side. ""I gotta pick up my medication at Walgreens or else I wouldn't be out the door.""
In Minneapolis, chilled to minus 14 F (minus 26 C), Brian Pierce ventured out to ""embrace the elements"" and found himself watching cars slipping on the roads.
""The roads sound really weird, it seems there’s a lack of grip,"" he said. ""And my teeth hurt.""
HEADING EAST 
Wind-chill temperatures in parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes plunged as low as minus 42 F (minus 41 C) in Park Rapids, Minnesota, and to 31 degrees below zero F (minus 35 C) in Fargo, North Dakota, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). The frigid winds began to blow into the U.S. East Coast later on Wednesday, sending temperatures plunging there.
More than a thousand flights, close to two-thirds of those scheduled, were canceled on Wednesday into or out of Chicago O'Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware. 
The Amtrak passenger rail service canceled all trains in and out of Chicago on Wednesday.
At the Morning Joy Farm in Mercer, North Dakota, Annie Carlson said her horses and sheep were doing fine. 
""They can go into the barn if they wish,"" she said. ""They're snuggled in, warm and toasty."" Her chickens, ducks and guinea hens were enjoying the 70-degree F (21 C) climate inside their greenhouse-like hoop house, she said.
Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the NWS, said some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at minus 55 F (minus 48 C). Even the South Pole in Antarctica was warmer, with an expected low of minus 24 F (minus 31 C) with wind chill.
Temperatures in Chicago will drop again ""quite precipitously"" on Wednesday night, Orrison said, potentially breaking the record low of minus 27 F (minus 33 C) on Jan. 21, 1985, the day of Ronald Reagan's second presidential inauguration. 
Banks and stores closed for business. Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM), a major trash collection company, said it canceled pickups in counties across the Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday.
WARMING CENTERS
The bitter cold was caused by a displacement of the polar vortex, a stream of air that normally spins around the stratosphere over the North Pole but whose current was disrupted and was now pushing south.
Officials opened warming centers across the Midwest, and in Chicago, police stations were open to anyone seeking refuge. Five city buses were also deployed to serve as mobile warming centers for homeless people, while city police handed out hats, jackets and blankets.
The Chicago Police Department said it was urging people to get out of the cold. ""But we will never force someone,"" police officer Michael Carroll said.
U.S. homes and businesses will likely use record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday, according to energy analysts.
Some residents just to the north and northwest of the Twin Cities in Minnesota were asked by  Xcel Energy  (NASDAQ:XEL) to dial down their thermostats to 60 F (16 C) because of the strains on its natural gas supply system.

The Michigan Agency for Energy said the state's utility companies had agreed not to shut off gas or electric supplies to delinquent customers for the rest of the week.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The California parole board recommended on Wednesday that Leslie Van Houten, the youngest of Charles Manson's murderous ""family"" of followers, be released early from the life prison term she is serving for her role in the cult's 1969 killing spree.
The ultimate decision on whether to grant parole to Van Houten, who was 19 at the time of the slayings and is now 69, rests with California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, twice denied the board's recommendation that she be set free.
Manson, who died in prison in 2017 at age 83, directed his mostly young and female devotees to murder seven people, including actress Sharon Tate, in August 1969 in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war.
Although Manson, one of the 20th century's most notorious criminals, did not personally kill any of the seven victims, he was found guilty of ordering their murders.
He was also convicted later of ordering the killings of two others during that summer - music teacher Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea.
Wednesday's decision by the parole board capped the latest of 22 attempts by Van Houten to persuade the panel that she be deemed suitable for release. She is currently being held at the California Institute for Women in Corona.
'HEALTER SKELTER'
In a statement, the parole board said its latest ruling begins an evaluation process of up to 150 days during which the agency's staff will ""review all the facts and matters of law related to the decision.""
""If the grant withstands scrutiny, it will then be sent to the governor's desk,"" the board said. The governor can uphold, reverse or modify the recommendation, or send it back to the board for further review. 
He may also opt to take no action, in which case the grant moves forward.
Van Houten was convicted of fatally stabbing grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in their Los Angeles home on Aug. 10, 1969. The words ""Death to Pigs,"" and ""Healter Skelter"" - a misspelled reference to a Beatles song - were found scrawled in the victims' blood on the walls and refrigerator.
The previous night, members of Manson's cult broke into the rented Los Angeles hillside home Tate shared with her husband, filmmaker Roman Polanski. Polanski was away in Europe at the time.
But Tate, who was 26 and eight months pregnant, was slain along with four friends of the celebrity couple, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring.
Van Houten's 1971 conviction and death sentence were initially overturned on appeal, but she was retried, convicted and sentenced to prison in 1978.

Earlier this month, local media reported that the board had recommended for parole another Manson follower - Robert Beausoleil, 71, who has served nearly half a century for the Hinman killing. Newsom has not revealed his decision in that case.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian opposition presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar said on Wednesday he would consider an amnesty for corruption suspects in order to help recover billions of dollars stashed abroad by the country's politicians and government officials.
Abubakar is the main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari in the Feb. 16 election, where corruption, security and the economy have been key issues. Buhari is hoping his anti-corruption agenda can win him a second term.
Nigerian state coffers have in past years been ransacked by government officials and their associates, and corruption is prevalent throughout society. Buhari was elected in 2015 in part on a promise to rid the country of graft.
The West African nation launched a whistleblower scheme two years ago entitling those who help find stolen assets to up to 5 percent of the recovered sums, part of a drive by Buhari to root out endemic corruption.
Abubakar said the amnesty program would encourage looters to voluntarily return some of the stolen funds badly needed to fund infrastructure investment and recommended sanctions for election rigging.
""Why can we not have an election fraud commission?"" Abubakar said during a televised town hall meeting to woo voters.
""So that we bring to book any individual, whether a member of a political party, INEC (electoral commission), or security services who infringes.""
Abubakar and his vice presidential candidate Peter Obi were repeatedly challenged on their track records regarding corruption, and about investing government funds in private businesses, some of which they owned shares in, while in public office. Both candidates denied any allegations of graft.
He also said he would be more than willing to investigate allegations of corruption in senior ranks of the military, as the military faces shortages of weapons and other resources in its war against Islamist insurgencies.
Critics have often accused the Nigerian military's senior officers of corruption, alleging that the graft drains resources and weapons from the northeast, where they are needed to fight advancing Islamist insurgencies.
Earlier on Wednesday Abubakar said in a speech he would create a $25 billion fund to support private sector investment in infrastructure if elected next month, as part of plans to revive the economy.

Nigeria's oil-dependent economy, which vies with South Africa's to be the largest in Africa, has performed below par since 2016, when it suffered its first recession in 25 years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said on Wednesday they expect Congress will pass a resolution ending U.S. involvement in the Yemen war, which would force President Donald Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency in order to continue supporting the Saudi-led coalition.
Republican and Democratic senators and representatives said on Wednesday they were re-introducing a war powers resolution that passed the Senate by 56-41 in December, a rebuke of Trump amid anger at Saudi Arabia not just over civilian deaths in Yemen, but also the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.
The lawmakers - an alliance of progressive Democrats and Republican constitutional conservatives - deplored the ""humanitarian disaster"" in Yemen but also said they wanted Congress to reassert its constitutional authority to decide whether the United States should be involved in military conflict.
""That decision has never been debated and discussed and voted on and approved by Congress,"" Republican Senator Mike Lee, one of the measure's sponsors, told a news conference.
The United States has supported the Saudi-led air campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen with mid-air refueling support, intelligence and targeting assistance. 
Opponents of the resolution are reluctant to risk disrupting the strategic U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, seen as an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran, arch-enemy of close U.S. ally Israel. 
The embassy of Yemen in Washington issued a statement opposing the resolution, saying it would ""deliver a massive victory to Iran"" if Washington were to stop supporting the coalition.
December's Senate vote was the first time either chamber of Congress backed a resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from a military engagement under the War Powers Act. That law, passed in 1973, limits the president's ability to commit U.S. forces to potential hostilities without congressional approval.
The measure never went further in December because the Republicans who then controlled the House of Representatives did not allow a vote in that chamber before the end of the year.
However, the measure's sponsors insisted it had helped lead to a ceasefire in Yemen that began in December. ""Sometimes we underestimate how much influence we have,"" Democratic Representative Ro Khanna said.
Democrats now have a House majority, but Trump's fellow Republicans have increased their edge in the Senate by two seats to hold a 53-47 margin.
It would take a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress to overcome a Trump veto. Trump had threatened a veto in December. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he still intended to do so.

""President Trump is going to have to make a decision,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>",U.S.-approved trustee for Russia's Deripaska has worked with him for years,"By Polina Ivanova, Polina Devitt and Nathan Layne
MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A law firm appointed to act as a buffer between Russian metals magnate Oleg Deripaska and one of his businesses, under a deal that allowed Washington to lift sanctions on the firm, has worked closely with Deripaska for years.
Asked about the law firm, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would vigorously monitor arrangements to ensure Deripaska cannot influence board members of the businesses. A representative for Deripaska said there was no scope for the businessman to influence how the law firm acted.
But a senior U.S. senator said the connection between Deripaska and the law firm further bolstered the argument, being made by U.S. President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents, that the sanctions should not have been lifted. 
The U.S. Treasury Department agreed to lift sanctions on three businesses controlled by Deripaska on condition that the tycoon - who will still be under sanctions himself - reduces his ownership in the businesses and severs his control.
As part of the deal, some of Deripaska's voting rights as a shareholder in his main company, En+, were handed over to a ""voting trust obligated to vote in the same manner as the majority of shares held by shareholders other than Deripaska,"" according to the Treasury Department. 
On Monday, announcing names of this and other trustees, En+ said that one of the trustees exercising the voting rights was called ""Ogier Global Nominee (Jersey) Limited.""
A source close to En+, when asked about the nature of the trustee, said Ogier Global was ""a very respectable Jersey law firm"".
Jersey-based Ogier Global has handled multiple deals involving Deripaska's firms.
Ogier's Cayman office represented Deripaska in a 2014 case against equity fund Pericles Emerging Market Partners, court documents showed. Pericles was run by Paul Manafort, who was briefly campaign chairman for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Ogier also acted on behalf of aluminum giant Rusal, which is controlled by En+, in 2017 when it placed the first ""Panda Bond"" offering by a Russian company, the name given to overseas debt sold in the Chinese market, Ogier said in a statement at the time. 
""Rusal is a long-standing client and we are particularly pleased to have worked with them again,"" a partner in Ogier's Jersey office was cited by the law firm as saying at the time.
One of its Jersey lawyers ""has worked on several headline deals including the $1.5 billion IPO of En+ Group,"" Ogier's website said. 
JERSEY PREMISES
Like Ogier, Rusal is registered in Jersey. As of Jan. 28, its registered address was the same as that of the Ogier law firm: Ogier House, 44 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey.
According to the Jersey Financial Services Registry, Ogier Global Nominee (Jersey) Limited is at that address, as is Ogier Global, and Ogier Global is listed as providing an office for Ogier Global Nominee.
Deripaska's representative told Reuters the deal left the businessman with no opportunity to influence Ogier and that the trustees have been vetted by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which administers U.S. sanctions.
Ogier has, in any case, no discretion on how to exercise the voting rights because it must vote in line with the majority of shares other than those held by Deripaska, the representative said.
En+ declined to comment. Ogier did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A Treasury spokesperson said OFAC has and will continue to ensure that the companies covered by the deal take the necessary steps to ensure that Deripaska doesn’t have influence or control over board members.
""As we’ve made clear from the beginning, OFAC will vigorously monitor and ensure compliance with all the requirements"" of the deal reached between OFAC and the Deripaska businesses, the spokesperson said.
U.S. congressional Democrats have kept up the pressure on the Trump administration over the decision to lift the sanctions, this week demanding additional briefings and floating the idea of legislation to make sure Rusal and En+ are in compliance.
Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been among the most vocal critics of the deal. 
“My concern all along was that Deripaska would, directly or indirectly, still retain control over his companies and benefit personally from this deal,” Warner said in response to a question from Reuters about Ogier’s role as trustee. 

“Potential conflicts of interest in the new governance structure are another data point demonstrating that the Senate should have overruled the Trump administration and kept the sanctions in place when we had the opportunity,” he said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean judge convicted six people on Wednesday of assassinating former President Eduardo Frei Montalva during the 1973 to 1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
Judge Alejandro Madrid sentenced the ex-president's doctors, his chauffeur, an army officer and a former intelligence agent to between three and 10 years in jail for the poisoning of Frei in a Santiago clinic in 1982.
The judge determined that Frei had been drugged by Pinochet's agents while the then 71-year-old recovered from hernia surgery in the clinic, according to court documents. Some of the doctors convicted then worked to cover up the poisoning, complicating the subsequent investigation.
Frei had initially supported Pinochet and the coup that overthrew socialist Salvador Allende in 1973. But he later soured on the military dictatorship and became one of the leaders of Chile's pro-democracy movement, a move that apparently precipitated his murder.
Madrid originally brought charges against the six men now convicted of the crime in 2009, but they were later dismissed. In 2016, Madrid ordered the exhumation of Frei's body and asked forensic experts to re-examine the remains.
The results confirmed that the former president was poisoned and strengthened the case against the accused.
Pinochet died in 2006 without ever facing a full trial for human rights abuses committed under his rule, when more than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared and around 28,000 people were tortured.

In recent years, prosecutions against dictatorship-era crimes have picked up pace, as support for Pinochet - once strong among conservative sectors of society - has faded.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>","'El Chapo' decided 'who lives and who dies' as drug boss, U.S. jury told","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was someone who decided ""who lives and who dies,"" a prosecutor said in closing arguments in the accused Mexican drug kingpin's trial in the United States.
""The government does not have to prove that he was the boss, or the only boss, or even one of the top bosses,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Goldbarg told jurors, though she hastened to add that Guzman was ""one of the top bosses, without a doubt.""
Guzman's lawyers have claimed the cartel's real leader is Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, who remains at large, and that their client was framed by Zambada.
Standing in front of a table piled with trial evidence including assault rifles and bricks of cocaine, Goldbarg took a calm, no-nonsense approach as she walked the jury in federal court in Brooklyn through the charges against Guzman one by one.
Guzman, 61, was extradited to the United States in January 2017. The 10 criminal counts include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy, and a life sentence if he is found guilty.
Goldbarg's summation capped an exhaustive government case that spanned 10 weeks of testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including law enforcement officials and former associates of Guzman who are cooperating with the U.S. government after striking plea deals. 
Guzman's lawyers have aggressively sought to undermine the cooperators' credibility in their cross-examinations, something Goldbarg addressed head on.
""These witnesses were criminals,"" she said. ""The government is not asking you to like them.""
However, she said, their testimony was corroborated by intercepted phone calls, text messages and letters from Guzman, as well as accounting ledgers seized in a raid on one of his safe houses.
""You know these cooperating witnesses are telling the truth because you heard the same thing from the defendant's own mouth,"" she said.
The intercepted communications showed Guzman plotting drug shipments, dealing with corrupt government officials and, sometimes, ordering his adversaries killed.
""He's the one who decides who lives and who dies,"" Goldbarg said.
Goldbarg then moved methodically through the evidence linking Guzman to each of a series of drug seizures by authorities in the 1990s and 2000s. Her argument is expected to last the rest of the day.

Guzman called only one witness in his defense on Tuesday. One of his lawyers is expected to deliver his closing argument on Thursday.

Yemen's warring parties have failed to pull troops from the country's main port under a month-old truce, reviving the threat of an all-out assault on Hodeidah that could unleash famine.
The Houthis control Hodeidah while other Yemeni factions backed by the coalition trying to restore the internationally recognized government are massed on its outskirts.
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said the Western-backed Sunni Muslim Arab coalition struck 10 Houthi training camps outside Hodeidah governorate on Wednesday. 
""Coalition prepared to use more calibrated force to prod Houthi compliance with Stockholm Agreement,"" he tweeted.
""To preserve ceasefire & any hope for political process, UN and international community must press Houthis to stop violations, facilitate aid convoys, and move forward on withdrawal from Hodaida city & ports as agreed,"" he added.

U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths has been shuttling between the parties to rescue the deal, the first major diplomatic breakthrough of the nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the verge of starvation.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's toughest rival in Israel's April election, a popular former general, made strong gains on Wednesday in the first opinion polls released after his inaugural campaign speech.
But in a multi-party contest whose ultimate winner has always been determined in Israel by post-election wheeling and dealing, Netanyahu is still on course to build a right-wing coalition in parliament similar to the one he now heads, according to commentary accompanying the surveys.
In a long-awaited speech on Tuesday that broke his silence since joining the campaign, former military chief Benny Gantz criticized what he termed a leadership detached from the people and too concerned with hanging onto power.
Four opinion polls on Israeli TV and news websites on Wednesday showed popularity spike for Gantz's new middle-of-the-road Resilience party at the expense of center-left rivals. But it was still running second to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud.
The surveys gave Gantz's party between 19 and 24 seats in the 120-member parliament - up from around 12 to 15 in previous polls - compared with 29 to 31 for Likud, about the same number as in earlier forecasts.
Political commentators have described Gantz as the first candidate in years that voters could regard as a match for Netanyahu, now in his fourth term as prime minister, in terms of security expertise.
In his speech on Tuesday, Gantz highlighted his military record and spoke mainly in generalities about policies he intends to pursue, pledging to be tough on security while striving to pursue peace.
Yaron Dekel, a political analyst, said on Israel's Channel 13 that if Gantz maintains his momentum and Likud's polling numbers drop to around 28 seats, Israelis will be able to say, ""Hang on, here's a fight we've never seen before'"".
Much could depend, commentators said, on whether Gantz and center-left parties can agree on an alliance and subsequently attract enough voter support to form a parliamentary bloc larger than a Likud-led coalition.
Netanyahu's legal troubles are also a wildcard: Israel's attorney general is presently weighing whether to charge him in three corruption cases, pending pre-trial hearings. His decision is widely seen as likely to be announced before balloting on April 9.
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.

Even if Likud comes out on top in the voting, some political commentators said, potential coalition members might balk at partnering with a prime minister facing a criminal trial.

Some activists had been calling for the military to back the protesters and pressure the government to step down.
""The armed forces will not allow the Sudanese state to fall or to slide into the unknown,"" said General Kamal Abdul Maarouf, chief of staff of the armed forces, in a statement.
He said those leading the protests were hostile to Sudan and were hurting the country's image.
Addressing soldiers this month, Bashir, a 75-year-old former paratrooper who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, said he would only move aside for another army officer, or at the ballot box.

The protests were triggered by price increases and cash shortages but quickly developed into demonstrations against Bashir.

The apparent swap comes as Yemen's warring parties are still hammering out details of a larger prisoner exchange that they agreed last month as a confidence-building gesture at the first major peace talks of the nearly four-year-old war.
The U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomed the release and said he hoped it would encourage the rapid implementation of the larger prisoner swap. 
""The [special envoy] is very encouraged by this positive spirit from the two parties,"" his office said on Twitter.
The war pits the Iran-aligned Houthis who control the capital Sanaa and most population centers against a government now based in the southern port of Aden, backed by forces from Arab states.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which provided the planes for both the freed Saudi and the seven freed Yemenis, said in a statement it had acted as a neutral intermediary and was not involved in negotiations over the releases.
""We are delighted these persons will soon be home,"" Yahia Alibi, head of the ICRC Regional delegation in Kuwait, said in a statement. ""We stand ready to act as a neutral intermediary so that thousands more affected by this conflict can return to their families.""
The United Nations is pushing for the warring parties to carry out the agreed prisoner exchange and implement a ceasefire in the main port city of Hodeidah to pave the way for a second round of discussions to end a war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.

Israel, which vehemently opposes the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, has called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit what it says is a ""secret atomic warehouse"" and other locations in Iran. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pulled his country out of the deal, has made similar calls.
The IAEA has bristled at such calls but used only guarded language in public, saying it does not take information at face value and assesses it independently, and then only sends inspectors to a specific location when necessary.
In a speech to staff on Wednesday, however, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano was blunt.
""If our credibility is thrown into question and, in particular, if attempts are made to micro-manage or put pressure on the agency in nuclear verification, that is counter-productive and extremely harmful,"" he said, according to a text of the speech posted online by the IAEA.
He did not elaborate on the attempts or those behind them.
The IAEA is policing the restrictions placed on Iran's nuclear activities under the deal, which also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.
Amano reiterated that Iran was continuing to keep its end of the bargain. Trump on Wednesday called top U.S. intelligence chiefs ""extremely passive and naive"" on Iran, a day after they contradicted his views in congressional testimony.
Amano was also more direct in making the case for his agency to be in charge of inspections in North Korea in the event of any political agreement being reached on that country's nuclear activities. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are due to hold their second summit in late February. 
""The IAEA is the only international organization that can verify the nuclear program of the DPRK,"" said Amano, using the acronym of the country's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Amano, a Japanese diplomat, has previously said his agency is best placed to do that job. It has not been granted access to North Korea since 2009, when Pyongyang threw out its inspectors.

""As far as the nuclear program of the DPRK is concerned, we remain ready to play an essential verification role if a political agreement is reached among countries concerned,"" he said.

Early this month, Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini proposed that Italy and Poland join forces to reshape Europe, trying to drum up support for a eurosceptic alliance ahead of European Parliament elections in May.
Orban gave his support to the initiative, saying he wanted anti-immigration parties to gain a majority at the vote. But a senior aide told Reuters that Fidesz would work on bolstering the poll showing of Hungarian candidates for the European People's Party.
""There is no hidden agenda here. The only thing is that these two politicians Mr. Salvini and Mr. Orban have a very similar if not identical approach on how we should tackle the migration challenge,"" state secretary Szabolcs Takacs said.
He said to his knowledge, no meeting was planned between Salvini and Orban, two hard-liners against mass immigration into Europe, in the foreseeable future.
""Both PiS in Poland and the League in Italy are not EPP members, whereas Fidesz is a member of the EPP. This very clearly defines our place and our position,"" Takacs said. ""Hungary is not participating in this cooperation in the European Parliament campaign.""
""What we would like to see is that the EPP remains where it should be remaining, the original values, ideas, Christian democracy.""
Takacs also said Hungary firmly backed Manfred Weber's candidacy to be the next European Commission President.
Hungary has been in conflict with European institutions over what critics say is Budapest's backsliding on democratic norms, with some controversial reforms affecting the independence of the judiciary and the media.
The European Parliament voted last September to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented step that left Prime Minister Viktor Orban isolated from powerful allies.
Takacs said he hoped the number of conflict points between Hungary and European institutions could decrease after the election, saying the next European Commission should take a less political role.
""What we would like to see is a completely different European Commission, which (guards) European law. Nothing more and nothing less,"" he said

""Unlike the current President, the European Commission should not declare itself to be a political player in the next institutional cycle.""

556,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>","Even behind bars, El Chapo's 'Robin Hood' luster glows in Mexico drug capital","By Dave Graham
CULIACAN, Mexico (Reuters) - In Mexico's drug trafficking heartland, the northwestern state of Sinaloa, admiration for captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman burns brightly even as the government makes progress in the fight against cartel violence.
Rising from humble origins to become Mexico's most wanted man, Guzman is on trial in a New York federal court, facing the prospect of spending his final years behind bars after an unparalleled career that made him a criminal sensation.
In his home state, the government says it has contained his Sinaloa Cartel, bolstered by military reinforcements.
During 2018, the first full year since Guzman was extradited to the United States, Sinaloa's share of Mexico's murder tally fell to its lowest since records began over two decades ago, bucking a trend of record murders sweeping the country.
Yet mistrust of government runs deep in the restive region split between inaccessible mountain villages and sunny beaches that has produced most of Mexico's top capos, and some residents say the cartel itself has sought to calm things down.
In the sprawling state capital Culiacan, where dazzling luxury rubs shoulders with stark poverty, support for Guzman is strong.
""He does what the police don't do. He protects the people,"" said of the capo Antonio Pinzon, a 45-year-old farm worker on a pilgrimage to the chapel of bandit folk saint Jesus Malverde.
By lauding Guzman in likening him to Malverde, a Robin Hood-like figure revered by some Roman Catholics and drug traffickers, Pinzon spoke for countless residents of Sinaloa, local politicians, journalists and security experts say.
Born in a poor mountain village in Sinaloa, where smugglers have grown opium and marijuana since the early 20th century, Guzman began rising through the ranks of the Mexican underworld in the 1980s as older kingpins fell.
Captured in 1993, Guzman broke out of jail eight years later and set about establishing his Sinaloa outfit as Mexico's top cartel. Eliminating rivals and buying off officials, he even earned himself a place on the Forbes rich list.
Security experts say the billions of dollars generated by the cartel give it power that cash-strapped local authorities are wary of challenging. That uneasy equilibrium has fed a widespread perception of political corruption.
Without the consent of capos, it was almost impossible to get elected in parts of Sinaloa, a senior politician from the state told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Still, pointing to lower crime rates, Cristobal Castaneda, Sinaloa's minister of public security, said the government went after all gangs with equal determination.
While murders in Mexico leapt by a third to more than 33,000 last year, they fell in Sinaloa by nearly a fifth to 1,072 - or 3.2 percent of the total, according to interior ministry data.
A decade earlier, as Guzman's star was in the ascendant, the state accounted for nearly 9 percent.
Castaneda complained that depictions of traffickers in TV series like ""Narcos"" and ""El Chapo"" distracted from Guzman's crimes.
""They make him look like Robin Hood,"" he told Reuters. ""Instead of exalting the authorities, they exalt the criminal.""
'MAGNIFICENT PERSON'
After more than a decade on the loose, Guzman was finally caught again in 2014. But in a humiliating turn for the government, he broke out of his prison cell through a mile-long tunnel in July 2015. He was recaptured six months later.
Mexico extradited him in January 2017, and since November he has been on trial in Brooklyn, charged with trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the United States. A verdict is expected in the next few days.
Witnesses have alleged he spent millions of dollars bribing officials and ordered or personally carried out murders of rivals. His defense lawyers say the real mastermind behind the Sinaloa Cartel is his associate Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, and that the 61-year-old Guzman is a scapegoat.
Few in Sinaloa dispute Guzman played a leading role, but Zambada's influence is also widely acknowledged.
""From what we Sinaloans can see, (Zambada) was the one in charge,"" said Manuel Clouthier, a Culiacan native and former independent federal congressman. ""When (Guzman) fell, nothing changed, because the head didn't fall.""
Since Guzman's arrest, Zambada has steadily consolidated the cartel's power, said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Diversification into other criminal activities, demand for newer drugs and blows to its main rival, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has enabled the gang to grow its business by about 15 to 20 percent, Vigil estimated.
Zambada has also kept a lid on violence, said a bookseller outside Culiacan cathedral named Ismael, who spoke wistfully of Guzman.
""We know he's involved in a bad business. But he himself is a magnificent person,"" he said. ""It's such a pity he won't be able to escape from the United States.""
BUSINESS AS USUAL
Castaneda said Sinaloa ""ideally"" needed 9,000 police to guarantee law and order - more than double its present tally. But he said the narcos have also become more discreet since Guzman's heyday.
""They're using compact cars now. They're not so ostentatious,"" he said. ""It's evolved. It's mutated.""
At the Jardines del Humaya cemetery, where some fallen kingpins are buried in pharaonic tombs, workers said Guzman's absence had not hurt business.
""We've got lots of work,"" said carpenter Santiago Rojo as he put finishing touches on an air-conditioned two-storey mausoleum with a marble staircase, bathroom and television screen.
Estimating up to 40 percent of Culiacan's economy drew on illicit funds, ex-lawmaker Clouthier said the Sinaloa Cartel had become expert at laundering money through legitimate avenues.
But cash of uncertain origin flows freely. Under colored parasols in the Mercadito area of downtown Culiacan, dozens of mostly female vendors buy and sell dollars below market rates - a practice widely believed to facilitate money laundering.
Periodic raids have been staged, but a dollar hawker named Juan estimated the number of selling posts had doubled in the past three years.
Here too, Guzman's shadow looms large.
Before becoming a drug trafficker herself, the protagonist of Spanish writer Arturo Perez Reverte's novel La Reina del Sur (The Queen of the South) sold dollars in the very same place.
The book became a successful TV show, and its star, Kate del Castillo, made headlines after it emerged she and U.S. actor Sean Penn had visited El Chapo while he was in hiding. DVDs of the series were found in Guzman's final hideout.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Marathon church session ends as Dutch let Armenian family stay,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A round-the-clock prayer service to stop an Armenian family being deported from the Netherlands was ended after 96 days on Wednesday, after the government agreed to make an exception to immigration rules.
Using a law that bars police from entering a place of worship while a service is in progress, hundreds of supporters of the Tamrazyan family have held rites non-stop at the Bethel church in The Hague since Oct. 26 to block their deportation.
Late on Tuesday, the cabinet decided to allow the Tamrazyans and other families rejected for permanent residence after living for years in the Netherlands to stay in the country after all.
The families, which together have around 700 children, did not qualify for an exemption granted to minors living in the Netherlands for more than five years.
To avoid other families with no other prospect of qualifying for permanent residence taking root in the Netherlands, the government will also try to speed up asylum procedures. 
""We are incredibly grateful that hundreds of refugee families will have a safe future in the Netherlands,"" a spokesman for Bethel Church, Theo Hettema, said on Wednesday.
But he said the church was worried about the consequences for future immigration policy. 
The fight over the ""children's pardon"" put pressure on Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right government, which has only a one-seat majority in parliament's Lower House, and looks set to lose its Senate majority in a March 20 election.
Rutte's Liberal party is trying to present a tough stance on immigration, to avoid losing ground to opposition parties such as the anti-Islam party of Geert Wilders.
Although Tuesday's decision was good news for the Tamrazyans, it came days too late for another family, the Grigoryans. That family of five, with children aged three to eight, was deported to Armenia early last week, just as the cabinet began deliberating on the issue. 
""This is unfair and very painful,"" their lawyer told Dutch news agency ANP on Wednesday. 
""If their deportation had been postponed a few days, the family would have been allowed to stay.""

Russia's senior prosecutor attended the plenary session and unexpectedly made the case for the arrest of 32-year-old Rauf Arashukov. The lawmaker tried to leave when his colleagues abruptly voted to strip him of his parliamentary immunity, the house speaker said. 
Arashukov was later shown in footage published by the Investigative Committee being led in handcuffs by security officers to a detention facility from a van. 
The Investigative Committee said Arashukov was being questioned as a suspect in the murders of a local youth activist and an adviser to the head of the southern Russian region of Karachaevo-Cherkessiya. 
Arashukov denies the accusations, his lawyer was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. 
Investigators said Arashukov, who represents the minority Russian Karachaevo-Cherkessiya region in the upper house, was having difficulties with the Russian language and had asked for an interpreter.
Recounting the detention afterwards, Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko said Arashukov had tried to get away during the session, but that she had told him to stay. 
""He tried to get up and leave the session. I told him to stay put because according to current regulations he had the right to speak and explain himself,"" she said.

Afghanistan has previously accused Pakistan of turning a blind eye to Afghan Taliban commanders on its soil and even of supporting the militant group it is fighting, which Islamabad denies.
Ghani said the ""key to peace was in Afghanistan"", as talks between Taliban and U.S. officials on ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan appear to be gaining momentum.
The leader of the war-torn nation made the remarks as U.S. peace negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul for consultations on his progress in talks with the Taliban.
A month ago, Pakistan assured Khalilzad that it would back a negotiated settlement with the Taliban to end the long war in Afghanistan. U.S. President Donald Trump has personally asked for Islamabad's help in advancing the Afghan peace process.
Regional powers such as China have also pledged to help Afghanistan and Pakistan overcome their longstanding suspicions about each other.
But political tension between Kabul and Islamabad and allegations thrown back and forth that security agencies in both countries support militant groups launching deadly attacks against one another continue to strain their ties.
In 2017, Pakistan began building a fence on its disputed 2,500 km (1,500 mile) border with Afghanistan to prevent incursions by militants.
Ghani also questioned the religious legitimacy of the Taliban, who have repeatedly refused to hold direct peace talks with the Afghan government.
""If the Afghan government is illegitimate, so where does the Taliban get their legitimacy from?,"" he said.
""Islamic scholars in Mecca and Indonesia said that suicide attacks and killing of civilians does not have a legitimacy...so where is the source of Taliban's legitimacy?,"" he asked.

Direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban collapsed in 2015, and the Taliban, fighting to drive out international forces and re-establish their version of strict Islamic law, have said they plan to continue negotiating with the U.S. officials on Feb. 25.

Yellow cake, or uranium ore, can be further processed into enriched uranium to make fuel for nuclear power plants, Iran’s stated aim, or to provide material for atomic bombs if refined much more, which the West fears may be the Islamic Republic’s ultimate goal.
U.S.-Iranian tensions have resurged since President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 nuclear accord, calling it deeply flawed. Under the deal, Iran restricted its enrichment program to ease concerns it could not be put to developing nuclear weapons and in return won relief from sanctions.
Thirty tons of yellow cake from a production plant in the city of Ardakan in central Iran was sent to a uranium conversion facility in Isfahan on Wednesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
This appears to be the second time a consignment of yellow cake has been delivered to the facility, which was reopened in June after lying idle for nine years.
The activity is permissible under the nuclear deal, which allows Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent -- far below the 90 percent of weapons grade -- and caps its stock of enriched uranium hexafluoride at 300 kg.
Yellow cake is converted into a gas called uranium hexafluoride (UF6) before enrichment. The shipment will subsequently be sent to the Natanz nuclear facility for enrichment, according to IRNA.
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said in June that the plant for the production of UF6, the feedstock for centrifuge machines that enrich uranium, had been relaunched at the Isfahan uranium conversion facility and a barrel of yellow cake had been delivered there.

Hamza Ulucay, a translator at the U.S. consulate in Adana, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail but released by the court due to time served, the state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
Ulucay was detained along with two other local U.S. consulate employees and a former Turkish-American NASA scientist in 2017 over terrorism charges. Washington wants all of them released.
During his trial on Wednesday Ulucay sought acquittal, but his request was denied and he was released with a travel ban after being sentenced, Anadolu said.
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara declined to comment.
Last year, relations between Ankara and Washington neared breaking point over the two-year detention and trial of U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges. Brunson, who denied the charges, was freed on Oct. 12.
While tensions eased between the NATO allies after Brunson's release, Ankara still repeatedly demands that the United States extradite U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016. Gulen denies any involvement.
Since the abortive putsch, Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants over suspected links to the coup attempt, according to the U.N. human rights office.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania has launched a manhunt for suspects in the abduction and murder of up to 10 children this month in cases believed to be linked to witchcraft, the home affairs minister said on Wednesday.
Officials in the Njombe district in southern Tanzania told local media this week at least four dead bodies of missing children had been found abandoned near bushes with missing body parts, which are believed to be used in rituals.
Superstition is deep-rooted among some communities in Tanzania, a nation of 57 million people. Albinos, who lack pigment in skin, eyes and hair, are among groups targeted by assailants who kill them or chop off their limbs.
""Our preliminary investigations have established that these incidents are caused by superstitious beliefs,"" Kangi Lugola told parliament, replying to a lawmaker who had demanded to know what the government was doing to stop the killings.
Lugola did not say whether the missing children were albinos.
""We have already identified some of the suspects and we will soon take action against them,"" Lugola said.
Albino hunters attack their victims usually with machetes and harvest their blood and body parts such as hair, genitals and limbs for potions.
Their body parts are prized in some regions of Tanzania, where witchdoctors say albinos bring luck in love, politics, life and business.
Women with red eyes are also vulnerable to attack. They are often accused of being witches and are killed in farming and fishing communities along the shores of Lake Victoria

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Security forces detained the daughter of Sudanese opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi on Wednesday, her family said, as anti-government protests spread to the capital's main university.
Two security vehicles arrived at Mariam Sadiq al-Mahdi's home in Khartoum in the morning and took her away, her sister Rabah told Reuters, a day after Sudan's security chief ordered the release of dozens of detained protesters.
There was no immediate comment from the government.
Mariam is deputy head of the opposition Umma Party headed by her father - who is Sudan's last democratically elected prime minister and was overthrown by President Omar al-Bashir in a coup in 1989.
She has supported a wave of protests that have shaken cities across Sudan since Dec. 19. Demonstrators, frustrated with bread and fuel shortages and other economic hardships, have called for the end of Bashir's three-decade rule.
Rights groups say at least 45 people have been killed. The government puts the death count at 30.
Around 250 professors from the University of Khartoum protested on campus on Wednesday, demanding a new transitional administration to replace the current one. 
About 510 of the university's professors signed a memo calling for the creation of a ""sovereign body"" to form a new government and oversee a four-year transitional period.
The university educated many of Sudan's leading politicians and has been the scene of protests and unrest throughout the country's tempestuous history.
""The University of Khartoum's role as an academic institution is to find solutions for the peaceful transfer of power,"" Montasser al-Tayeb, one of the professors, told reporters.
Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan last month from nearly a year in self-imposed exile and called for a democratic transition before thousands of supporters.

He was overthrown by an alliance of Islamists and military commanders, led by Bashir, that still forms the nucleus of the ruling National Congress Party.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Bashir's hometown split as anti-government protests hit Sudan,"By Khalid Abdelaziz
SHENDI, Sudan (Reuters) - Fed up by months of bread queues, price hikes and petrol shortages in Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir's hometown of Shendi, office worker Louay Mohamed Kheir, feels there's only one solution: ""We need a new president.""
It is a startling statement from anyone living in the settlement down the Nile from Khartoum - long seen as one of Bashir's firmest powerbases and his tribe's main town.
Shendi has not seen any of the mass protests against Bashir's rule that have rocked much of the rest of Sudan for the past six weeks. But it has not escaped the economic hardships that have been driving that unrest.
As Kheir speaks in his home, other residents stand in line outside downtown bakeries while cars queue up to get scarce petrol.
""Sudan has deteriorated during Bashir's rule, and there is a failure in managing the country economically and politically,"" the 43-year-old tells Reuters. ""The protests will continue until the regime is gone.""
Not everyone out in Shendi shares Kheir's views. 
Emad Abdel-Rahman, 53, defends Bashir and says he does not want to see secular activists taking over. 
""I am for implementing Islamic sharia laws and therefore I support the ruling party,"" he tells Reuters. ""Yes, we are going through economic difficulties but we support Islam and stability in Sudan.""
But the fact that anyone there is willing to call openly for the replacement of Shendi's most famous son underlines how far even government strongholds have been shaken by the nationwide demonstrations.
""NEW FACE""
Residents debate Bashir's record in the streets. Some complain that food prices, even of locally-produced vegetables and meat, had been rising as inflation soars.
""Yes, Bashir is the son of this region, but 30 years is enough,"" says one 27-year-old woman, who asks not to be named.
""We are not against Bashir, but I believe it would be better if he did not run in the 2020 presidential election. We need a new face.""
The conversation turns to what Bashir has done closer to home.
Bashir was born in 1944 in the nearby village of Hosh Bannaga, then went to school and grew up in Shendi.
Supporters give Bashir the credit for Shendi's university, its hospital and a bridge crossing over to the other side of the Nile that was opened in 2009.
Detractors talk about the unpaved roads in both communities. In Hosh Bannaga, many still live in mud houses that line dusty roads, where donkey-drawn carts travel back and forth.
Sudan's economic problems - ranging from severe cash shortages to spiraling inflation - have been exacerbated by the loss of three quarters of its oil reserves since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.
Many foreign investors have stayed away, unwilling to do business with a country whose leader is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of masterminding genocide in Darfur - charges he denies.
Bashir has blamed unnamed foreign enemies and foreign sanctions. 
He has promised to bring in more investment and to lobby to get the country removed from a list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism. 
For many in Shendi, those are promises he still has to deliver on.
""We have no personal problem with Bashir, provided he fixes our problems, and provide bread, fuel and jobs,"" says a 19-year-old university student who does not give her name. 

""We have no problem if he wants to remain in power. We just want to have a better life.""

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Vale SA, the world's largest iron ore miner, vowed to sacrifice production for safety to avoid another instance of the tailings dam failures that have tarred its legacy - a move that sent metal prices and shares of rivals soaring. 
Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman vowed to take up to 10 percent of Vale's output offline to decommission 10 dams similar to the one that burst on Friday in the town of Brumadinho, leaving hundreds missing and presumed dead.
Chinese iron ore futures jumped in early trade on Wednesday, and shares of mining rivals BHP Group,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and Fortescue Metals Group lifted Australia's benchmark metals and mining index to its best day in two years.
The dramatic move by Vale was an effort to preempt tough questions about its safety record, as the Friday disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine - where the death toll has reach at least 84 people - came just over three years after a similar dam burst at the nearby Samarco mine it co-owns with BHP. 
Vale's plan to cut output was expected to cost 5 billion reais ($1.3 billion) over the next three years, and involved suspending operations at mines producing some 40 million tonnes of iron ore and 11 million tonnes of pellets per year, Schvartsman told journalists in Brasilia. 
Brazilian prosecutors have said they will bring criminal charges against those responsible for the disaster and on Tuesday they arrested three Vale employees, including two senior managers at Corrego do Feijao. The have also arrested two engineers from German auditor firm TUV SUD. 
In the town of Brumadinho, which was devastated by the torrent of mining waste, Vale workers organized to demand more from the company. In a letter seen by Reuters, the local miners' union demanded months of additional pay and years of guaranteed employment, among other benefits. 
In a separate statement, the union said it had asked Vale for the last two years to move the company dining hall, which was located directly under the dam, a charge that Vale denied. 
A worker outside the cafeteria who narrowly escaped the fast-moving mud flow told Reuters he doubted anyone inside had made it out alive.
On a hilltop site, Brumadinho cemetery director Jose Eustaquio da Silva, 63, has been working long days, digging 98 graves with his team in one cemetery alone. So far, five of the graves have been filled as recovery crews comb through mud from the disaster. 

""Everyone is tense,"" he said. ""People who live near other dams are tense as well.""

Lebanon urgently needs a government to start addressing its extensive economic ills, which include a public debt equal to around 150 percent of GDP and years of low growth. 
Asked if the government would be formed within 24 to 48 hours, Abdul Rahim Mrad told al-Jadeed TV: ""I believe it will have been formed, I believe so because the atmosphere today is this."" 
He is one of six pro-Hezbollah Sunni Muslim MPs whose representation in the cabinet has been one of several obstacles to the formation of the government to be led by prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri, also a Sunni.
Hariri said on Tuesday that this week would be decisive in efforts to form the government, but warned that this was ""a last chance"" to settle things.
Caretaker information minister Melhem Riachi, of the anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces party, wrote on Twitter: ""And finally it is concluded on Friday Feb 1 2019,"" without elaborating. 
Discussions over a new national unity government began after May's national election, the first in nine years, and aimed to distribute cabinet positions among Lebanon's main political blocs and according to its delicate sectarian balance.
""A SERIOUS ATMOSPHERE"" 
There have been several moments when a government seemed close, but ultimately failed to emerge, including in December when Hariri indicated a breakthrough might be hours away.
Lebanon's economy and financial system have shown resilience during previous periods of political paralysis, but Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said last month that the country faced an economic crisis that was at risk of becoming a financial one. . 
Concerns over the economy have been reflected in Lebanese bond prices and the costs of insuring against its public debt.
The International Monetary Fund warned in June that urgent measures are needed to put Lebanon's finances on a sustainable footing.
The Hezbollah-aligned Sunni MPs met senior Hezbollah official Hussein Khalil on Tuesday night. The heavily armed Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah is the most powerful group in the country.
Asked how the latest efforts differed from previous failed attempts to form the government, Mrad said: ""The difference is there is a serious atmosphere.""
He noted that Gebran Bassil - a Christian politician at the heart of the talks - had ""intensified his activities"" in the last 24 or 48 hours.

The front page headline of the pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper declared on Tuesday: ""Balanced concessions accelerate the birth of the government"".

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - U.S. security aid for the Palestinian Authority was set to dry up on Thursday after it declined the money over concerns it could increase its exposure to U.S. anti-terrorism lawsuits.
The loss of the some $60 million in annual funding would marks another tear in ties between the Trump administration and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and potentially undermines his security cooperation with Israel in the occupied West Bank.
Diplomatic sources said Palestinian, U.S. and Israeli officials were seeking a way to keep the money flowing despite Abbas's decision to turn it down as of a Jan. 31 deadline set by Congress' Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA) of 2018.
The ATCA empowers Americans to sue foreign aid recipients in U.S. courts over alleged complicity in ""acts of war"". 
Abbas's administration, long accused by Israel of stoking Palestinian militant attacks, worries about such legal exposure. It denies encouraging any such acts.
""We do not want to receive financial aid, including aid provided to the security forces, so as not to be subject to the anti-terrorism law approved by Congress,"" one Palestinian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
""The U.S. administration was surprised by the Palestinian decision, and said it wanted to find a solution in order to continue aid to the Palestinian security services."" 
Such a solution may include finding alternative funds within the CIA budget or amending U.S. legislation, he said.
The U.S. Embassy in Israel had no immediate comment. Israeli officials declined to confirm or deny there were workaround talks, but sought to offer reassurance that Israel could manage security in the West Bank, which it captured in the 1967 Middle East War, even without Palestinian help.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also be disinclined to signal worries about the West Bank ahead of his bid to stay in office in an election in April as the Palestinians' goal of an independent state is rejected by many of his fellow Israeli rightists.
""Israel cannot save the failing leadership of the Palestinian Authority,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely told Reshet Channel 13 TV when asked about the cut in U.S. funding.
""The most we can do is say to them, 'since this is our land, if you cannot govern, then we can.""
The Palestinian Authority is an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo peace accords. The peace process, aimed at finding a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has been stalled for several years.
The Palestinians have also been boycotting the United States since it recognized disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. 

The Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to come back to the negotiating table.

Araibi, who fled Bahrain in 2014 and was later granted asylum in Australia, was arrested in Bangkok in November on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain's request..
He was convicted of vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia. He denies wrongdoing, saying he was playing in a televised football match at the time of the alleged vandalism. 
Human rights groups say Bahraini authorities tortured Araibi because of his brother's political activities during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. Bahraini authorities deny allegations of torture.
Nadthasiri said the letter had been submitted to the government.
""Once the prime minister reads it maybe he will help based on humanitarian considerations because he has the power to do so,"" she told Reuters.
Though Araibi's morale was low, Nadthasiri said he had told her when she visited him in prison, that he was hopeful he would be released back to Australia.
HONEYMOON HELL
Araibi's wife said in her letter the newly wed couple traveled from Australia to Thailand ""because we thought it would be the perfect country to have our honeymoon"" but instead found themselves in a nightmare of arrest and detention.
She asked Prayuth to show the same concern for those fleeing torture as Thailand did in the case of 18-year-old Saudi woman Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who fled what she said was family abuse to Thailand and was quickly resettled to Canada this month..
Thai government officials were not immediately available for comment. Prayuth told reporters on Tuesday Araibi's case was a matter for Thailand's courts.
He acknowledged the concerns of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who urged this week that Araibi not be extradited, but also said Thailand had good relations with Bahrain.
""We are good friends with everyone. We have to figure out the solution. I know that everybody is concerned about this,"" Prayuth said. 
Araibi has also been a vocal critic of the president of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, who is a cousin of the Bahraini king.
Sheikh Salman has recused himself from the Araibi case and the AFC joined soccer's world governing body FIFA this week in urging Thailand to allow Araibi to return to Australia.
Activists and athletes from Australia and around the world have called for Araibi to be allowed to go back to Australia. Players, the manager and owner of Thai soccer league club Chiang Rai United joined the call for his release.

Nadthasiri has said the next step was to see whether Thai prosecutors would submit Bahrain's extradition request, made this week to the Thai court, which was expected in early February.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",Roadblocks cast shadows over path to peace in Afghanistan,"By Greg Torode, Rupam Jain and Abdul Qadir Sediqi
KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. diplomats and the Afghan Taliban have seen cause for hope in talks to end the United States' longest war, but the pivotal issues of a ceasefire and the militants sitting down with the Afghan government are far from being resolved.
Areas in which both sides have hailed progress - plans for the withdrawal of foreign troops 17 years after the U.S.-led ouster of the Taliban and assurances that Afghanistan won't become a base for al Qaeda or Islamic State - still need detailed negotiation, sources on both sides said.
The withdrawal, for example, is contingent on a ceasefire that the Taliban have yet to discuss.
""We want to be absolutely sure that the U.S. is leaving before we call off the fight,"" said a senior Taliban official on condition of anonymity.
But a senior U.S. official privy to the negotiations was clear a ceasefire had to come first: ""How could we even do a withdrawal without a ceasefire?""
And the Taliban's assurances on counter-terrorism also come with caveats.
They say they can guarantee the United States the security of the half of the country they now control, but they would have to be in an interim government to be sure of stopping al Qaeda or Islamic State from attacking anywhere else.
Left to watch the unlikely U.S. and Taliban tango as he eyes a second term, Western-backed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani refuses to accept an interim government as part of any deal.
""We want peace, we want it quickly, but we want a proper plan ... so the mistakes of the past do not repeat,"" Ghani said in a televised address on Monday, referring to a bloody history of failed governments, military coups and civil war.
Ghani mentioned the deaths of previous rulers, including former President Najibullah, who was hanged from a Kabul lamppost when Taliban guerrillas swept into the capital in 1996.
NEW NEGOTIATOR
The next round of talks will be held in Qatar on Feb. 25 when Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former mujahideen fighter against the Soviet occupation of the 1980s, will head the Taliban side following his release last year from eight years in a Pakistani jail. 
U.S. officials told Reuters they hope he will have the authority to negotiate on the ceasefire and the need for discussions with the Afghan government. The Taliban have so far refused to talk to the government which they dismiss as a puppet of the United States.
Baradar, a co-founder of the movement and a former military commander in western Afghanistan, will enter new talks from a position of relative strength as its new political chief, Taliban officials said.
For years, the Taliban have fought to expel foreign forces and drive the government from power, so they can restore their version of hardline Islamic law across Afghanistan.
After intensifying attacks over the last two years, the Taliban are more powerful than any at other time since they were toppled by Western forces.
And senior Taliban officials say they know the United States and other foreign forces are tired and want out. While they, meanwhile, can sense victory and a future role in government.
""If the Afghan government and the Taliban have an agreement, it will involve altering government arrangements in some respect, creating a more inclusive government and consolidating the Afghan security forces and the Taliban in some new security architecture,"" said James Dobbins, a former diplomat who is now senior fellow at the RAND Corporation think-tank.
Dobbins, who was the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2013, said it would take a long time to reach a deal that would be sustainable. 
But however much time the talks took, the senior U.S. official privy to the talks, who did not want to be identified, insisted: ""We will not leave Afghanistan without a deal. We want to leave a good legacy.""
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Doubts have increased in recent weeks whether U.S. President Donald Trump would stomach a protracted presence in Afghanistan amid mixed signals from Washington. 
U.S. officials told Reuters last month that Trump had issued verbal orders to plan for a withdrawal of about half of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. However, they said he could reverse course. 
The U.S. troops in Afghanistan are part of a NATO-led mission and a U.S. counterterrorism mission largely directed at groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.
Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries are participating in the operation, known as Resolute Support.
Diplomats and military attaches from many of those countries describe an intense desire to leave. Italy is considering sending home its 900 troops within a year.
The period after any deal and withdrawal is also fraught with risks. Kabul-based Western envoys say little hard thought has been given to how aid plans and other support would have to be intensified and tailored to fit a new era of peace, and possible power sharing.
Some also warn of a spike in violence as fighters on both sides return to villages and start new lives.
Afghans and regional diplomats also fear a U.S. bid to cut a hasty deal with the Taliban could allow militia groups to exploit ethnic rivalries to usurp power.
Then there is the worry that the country's nascent democracy and women's rights could crumble in the absence of foreign forces. 
Ghani made clear this week they are worries he shares, even if question marks remain over his ability to shape events ahead.

""I, as an elected leader in charge of 35 million Afghans, ... know what are the probable dangers and threats after the peace deal.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - A top confidant of South Korea's President Moon Jae-in was jailed for two years on Wednesday under a computer crime law for posting fake ""likes"" on online posts favorable to Moon during his election campaign.
The sentence for Kim Kyung-soo, touted by some as a possible future presidential candidate, deals another blow to Moon, who faces plunging ratings, economic woes and accusations of corruption against some aides and political allies.
The prosecution said Kim, with the help of a political blogger, used automatic clicking software to boost ""likes"" on various postings and thereby interfere in the 2017 presidential election, which Moon won.
""Kim received substantial help in driving public opinion the way he wanted,"" the YTN broadcaster quoted the judge, Sung Chang-ho, as telling the court.
Kim denied the charge and said he would ""fight to the end"", shortly after the judge handed down the verdict, YTN reported.
In a statement read to reporters by his lawyer, Oh Young-joong, Kim said the verdict was ""unacceptable"" because it was based on ""proofless claims"" and a ""false confession"" by the political blogger.
Kim did not say if he would appeal but vowed to launch ""another long battle for the truth.""
The blogger, Kim Dong-won, better known as his pen name ""Druking,"" was jailed for three and a half years on a similar charge in a separate trial earlier on Wednesday.
Kim Kyung-soo is governor of South Gyeongsang Province and will lose that post if a higher court upholds the sentence.
Moon's spokesman said in a statement the sentence was ""never expected"" and his office would follow developments until the final decision ""in a calm manner"".
Moon's party expressed regret, accusing the court of making a mistake and jailing an innocent person.
The party is looking ahead to parliamentary elections next year when it hopes to regain a majority in parliament. 
Moon recently replaced his chief of staff and other top aides in a bid to revitalize momentum for his presidency. 

South Koran presidents are limited to a single term but Moon will be keen to see his party's candidate win in the next election, due in 2022.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government will hold last-ditch negotiations with public sector unions on Wednesday to try to avert a national strike that could trigger more unrest after this month's violent protests.
But the main teachers union said it was not expecting any progress and was already making plans for a Feb. 5 walkout. The president's spokesman said troops would stay on the streets and the state would block the internet again if violence erupted.
Teachers and other state workers are demanding wage rises and payments in dollars to help them stave off spiraling inflation and an economic crisis that has sapped supplies of cash, fuel and medicines.
Rights groups say at least 12 people were killed this month after a three-day stay-at-home strike over a fuel price hike led to street protests and a crackdown by security services. The government says three people died.
Civil servants unions will meet the government from 1 p.m. (1100 GMT).
""Today is the last meeting but we have already made a decision. We are talking to our constituency because we want this strike to have an impact,"" Thomas Muzondo, the deputy president of the Zimbabwe Teachers Association (ZIMTA) said.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa - who came to power in November 2017 after long-time ruler Robert Mugabe was forced to resign in a coup - has promised to investigate the crackdown on protesters and to bring in measures to tackle the economic crisis.
His spokesman said it would take time to rebuild an economy that had been suffering for decades.
""There are key bread and butter questions which government cannot dodge, things are tough,"" George Charamba told a state-owned Harare radio station. 
""But it would be a sad day to think that the only way that we can remedy such a problem is by causing further damage to that already damaged economy through mayhem, through looting, through chaos.""

Charamba said police and soldiers would remain on the streets and that government would shut down the internet again if violent protests broke out. He previously said the security crackdown was a foretaste of how the government would react to future protests.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions.
Workers, including truck drivers, farmers and merchants, have since launched sporadic protests against economic hardships, which have occasionally led to confrontations with security forces.
“Today the country is facing the biggest pressure and economic sanctions in the past 40 years,” Hassan Rouhani said, according to the presidential website.
“Today our problems are primarily because of pressure from America and its followers. And the dutiful government and Islamic system should not be blamed,” he added.
Rouhani spoke at a ceremony at the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini - part of a series of events leading up to the 40th anniversary of the February 11th revolution.

Iran’s rial currency has fluctuated in value in recent months, making it difficult for ordinary people to make ends meet.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 02:58AM ET</span>",Mongolia parliamentary speaker ousted amid corruption scandal,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia's parliamentary speaker, Enkhbold Myegombo, has been ousted following weeks of public protests against him over accusations he was involved in the corrupt sale of government positions.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in late December to protest against Enkhbold and the two main political parties, the Mongolian People's Party and the Democratic Party.
Public unrest has simmered throughout January, with a cross-party group of legislators boycotting parliament. Some protesters began hunger strikes on Ulaanbaatar's central Sukhbaatar Square (NYSE:SQ) on Jan. 10.
The role of foreign investment in resource-rich Mongolia's development has also come under scrutiny, with many nationalist politicians complaining that strategic assets have been sold off to foreign firms on the cheap. 
Enkhbold denied accusations of corruption and declined to resign, but parliament voted in favor of forcing his dismissal late on Tuesday in a procedure initiated by President Khaltmaa Battulga, who defeated Enkhbold in a 2017 election.
""I was not playing tricks to save my position, I believed this problem should be solved legally,"" Enkhbold said, complaining that the dismissal procedure undermined parliamentary democracy.
He could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. 
Audio recordings released by a whistleblower last year were believed to implicate a number of politicians in a scheme aimed at raising 60 billion tugrik ($23 million) in campaign funds for 2016 parliamentary elections, which were won by Enkhbold's Mongolian People's Party.
Five members of parliament have led efforts against Enkhbold and the two parties, and they announced on Monday they had formed a group called ""Wealth Owner Mongolia"" that would fight against corruption and nationalize mines of ""strategic"" importance. 
Mongolia's biggest foreign-invested project, the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine run by Anglo-Australian giant  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), is also at the center of a corruption investigation involving a former finance minister who signed the original 2009 investment deal. 

Mongolia is working with overseas investigators to look into suspected corruption at the mine, the anti-graft agency said on Tuesday, after the re-arrest of the minister.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania's parliament passed amendments to legislation late on Tuesday that give sweeping powers to a government-appointed registrar over political parties, a move that opposition legislators say will cement ""one-party rule"". 
President John Magufuli's government has already banned some newspapers, restricted opposition rallies and detained dozens of their members which, along with repeated state intervention in key sectors like mining and agriculture, have dimmed investment in the region's third-biggest economy. 
The amendments give a government-run registrar sweeping powers to de-register parties and provide for up to a year in jail for anyone engaging in unauthorized civic education - for example, a voter registration drive. 
Critics say the amendments will sharply curb freedoms in the East African nation and prevent an effective challenge to Magufuli and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in next year's general election and this year's local elections.
Opposition leaders said the legislative changes would effectively criminalize political activity and turn Tanzania into ""a de facto one-party state"".
""You can't have a constitution that allows freedom of association then give someone powers to revoke that freedom of association,"" Zitto Kabwe, the leader of the opposition ACT-Wazalendo party, said in parliament late on Tuesday after unsuccessfully seeking a court injunction to try to block parliament from passing the law.
Another opposition MP, Esther Bulaya, said the legislation would give the registrar of political parties ""excessive powers"" to interfere with internal affairs of political parties, including stripping individuals of party membership and removing them from leadership positions.
But ruling party lawmakers say the amendments give the registrar much-needed authority to act as a referee and ensure political parties do not embezzle subsidies from taxpayers and that they hold transparent internal leadership elections.
Tanzania, a nation of 57 million people, has long been regarded as one of Africa's most stable democracies. The ruling CCM party, and its predecessor TANU, have governed since independence from Britain in 1961.
Magufuli, 59, was elected in 2015. He is been nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"", partly for his pugnacious management style.
His government's curbs on freedom of expression have drawn criticism from Western donors who provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Some have suspended loans or aid.
The legislation was aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability, said Jenista Mhagama, the minister of state in the prime minister's Office responsible for parliamentary affairs.
The Political Parties Act being amended was passed in 1992 when Tanzania adopted multiparty politics.
""This legislation has already been amended seven times since its enactment ... with the objective of strengthening multiparty democracy in the country,"" Mhagama told parliament.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean appeals court on Wednesday nearly doubled jail time for a former speed skating coach convicted of hitting a two-time Olympic champion, citing a need to warn sports officials against the use of violence as a training tool. 
The case, and the athlete's accusation that the coach had also sexually abused her, has triggered South Korea's largest investigation into physical and sexual assaults in sport after the events sparked a flood of similar accusations. 
Speed skating has a huge and devoted following in South Korea, which has won 24 gold medals in the sport since it became an Olympic event in 1992, more than any other country. 
In September, a lower court had jailed the former national coach, Cho Jae-beom, for 10 months on a conviction of assaulting Olympic champion Shim Suk-hee, 21.
""The defendant...has shown regret but has severely hit the victim with his fists and feet ever since the victim was young, taking as the reason a slack attitude during training,"" the Suwon District Court said as it raised the term to 18 months. 
""The lower court's sentencing is too light, therefore unjust,"" it added. ""There is a great need to sternly warn sports leaders who still consider this as a method of training athletes and fundamentally prevent a repeat of assault incidents."" 
The prosecution had sought a two-year sentence on the charges, which Cho had admitted.
""It's a good thing that the sentence has gone up,"" Shim's lawyer, Im Sang-hyeok, told domestic news agency News1.
""But it still seems too light. I believe more strict punishment is needed. I believe prosecutors will decide on further appeal, if only to send a warning."" 
Im did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters. 
Police are also investigating accusations Shim made in December that Cho had sexually assaulted her from the time she was 17. 
Cho has been questioned twice in January on the sex abuse accusation at a detention center where he is being held, a police official said. 
Cho denies the accusation of sexual abuse, his lawyer Oh Dong-hyun has said. Reuters could not immediately reach Oh by email or telephone. 
Cho has not been charged on the sex abuse allegations. 
The national outrage over the case has prompted more athletes, in sports such as judo and archery, to come forward with accounts of assault and sexual abuse, media have said. 

On Friday, the government said it would hold an inquiry, along with the National Human Rights Commission, to investigate conditions for about 63,000 student athletes, and warned of possible cuts in funding for any sport facing public outcry.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2019 01:31AM ET</span>",Mexico's fuel thieves undeterred by deadly blast,"By David Alire Garcia
TLAHUELILPAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Days after a fireball erupted near the Mexican town of Tlahuelilpan, killing at least 117 people pilfering gasoline from a pipeline, the area's fuel bandits were back in business.
Illegal taps, some of them newly opened, were the giveaway that fuel was flowing again. Soldiers patrolling this area in central Mexico after the Jan. 18 tragedy told Reuters they found 15 illicit spigots just a few kilometers away on the same pipeline operated by the nation's state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex.
In one spot, Reuters saw a freshly dug hole leading to a shiny valve attached to the pipeline lying about a meter underground. Nearby were discarded plastic hoses, snack wrappers, an empty pack of cigarettes and a blanket still wet with gasoline. 
Such is the mammoth task confronting President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to end Mexico's rampant fuel theft. The practice is depriving the government of badly needed tax revenue; it cost Pemex an estimated $3 billion last year alone.
Security experts say small-time thieves, organized crime gangs and corrupt Pemex employees all have a hand in the trade. The crudest operators hack into pipelines to siphon gasoline and diesel, often at night in rural outposts. They then resell it to gas station owners, at roadside stands and in open-air markets.
A Pemex spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In December, Lopez Obrador announced a crackdown on the banditry. To thwart pipeline taps, he ordered Pemex to transport some fuel overland in tanker trucks. The result: widespread shortages and long lines at gas stations.
The bottlenecks have eased. But fuel theft is so endemic that the culture will be hard to break, even in Tlahuelilpan.
An estimated 800 of the town's residents, many carrying buckets, had flocked to a nearby pipeline when word spread on social media that a large pool of gasoline had sprung from a bootleg tap. Dozens were killed when the gas ignited; scores more were badly burned. 
Marcelino Valdez, a Catholic priest in Tlahuelilpan, said in between funerals that many here support Lopez Obrador. But he doubted the president's strategy would yield quick results in an area where nearly two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, according to government data.
""The people don't like to steal, it's not something they enjoy,"" Valdez said. ""But they look up and see so much corruption, so much injustice, and they see that their hands are empty.""
(For a graphic on Mexico's fuel theft problem, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2Tms3tZ)
PEMEX IMPLICATED
Hidalgo state, where Tlahuelilpan is located, is the nation's leader in illicit breaches of Pemex pipelines. Fuel thieves known as huachicoleros last year drilled a record 2,121 illegal taps in the state, or nearly six each day, according to Pemex data. That is more than a six-fold increase in just two years.
Oil industry experts say Hidalgo's location is a big reason. Situated to the north of the Mexican capital, the state is home to Pemex's second-biggest oil refinery and critical pipelines supplying the giant Mexico City metro area.
Fuel prices are a factor too. At the start of 2017, the government of then-President Enrique Pena Nieto hiked prices by as much as 20 percent in a bid to end costly subsidies, a move many in Tlahuelilpan say is driving theft. 
Since Lopez Obrador's term began on Dec. 1, the government says it has arrested 558 people accused of stealing fuel. It has frozen bank accounts and deployed soldiers to guard key Pemex installations, including the Tula refinery about 9 miles (15 km) southwest of Tlahuelilpan.
While organized crime is a big player, the president has reserved particular disdain for Pemex, blaming crooked company insiders for much of the illicit trade.
""We're talking about a plan that has ties inside the government,"" he said during a Dec. 27 press conference.
Juan Pedro Cruz, mayor of Tlahuelilpan, likewise is suspicious of Pemex employees. He told Reuters he visited the site of an illegal pipeline tap shortly after he was elected in 2016. Cruz said he watched as Pemex workers carefully covered up the tap without disabling it.
""What message did that send to me?"" Cruz said. ""They were going to use it again.""
Cruz has faced questions too. Following the January accident, news reports linked him to a local warehouse that once was used to store stolen fuel. Cruz denied wrongdoing. He said Pemex solicited his help in finding temporary storage for gasoline recovered from crooks. 
In addition to arresting fuel thieves, Lopez Obrador has launched a new 3,600 peso ($189) monthly scholarship for unemployed Mexican youth, a program he has pitched as a way to address the root causes of crime.
But some townspeople in Tlahuelilpan doubt it will dissuade many young people from seizing what some see as their only opportunity to get ahead.
Mariano Hernandez, a local math teacher, said some fuel thieves can clear as much as 10,000 pesos ($525) daily.
""They say, 'I'd rather make a lot of money for one or two years than live many years in poverty,'"" Hernandez said.
The president's steepest challenge may be persuading people such as Magali Ortiz that fuel theft is worthy of such high-profile scrutiny.
Her husband Omar Vasquez died in the conflagration. Two other relatives are missing.

Stealing fuel is ""not a crime,"" Ortiz said. ""It's a job.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine authorities called for calm on Wednesday after a grenade attack on a mosque in a mainly Christian southern province killed two people, just three days after a devastating church bombing shook the restive Mindanao region.
A grenade was thrown into a mosque during the night in Zamboanga, killing two people and wounding four others, prompting condemnation and calls for cool heads and unity among Christian and Muslim communities with a long history of peaceful coexistence.
The grenade incident came a few hours after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on television said an attack on a church that killed 21 people on mainly Muslim Jolo island may have involved a suicide bomber.
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Wednesday said the second of two explosions in the church was ""probably"" a suicide bombing, but said it was not clear if Islamic State was really behind it, as it had not revealed the identity of the ""martyr"".
Islamic State has claimed involvement, but the military believe it was the work of the Muslim militant Abu Sayyaf group. 
Lorenzana told reporters forensic tests would be carried out to try to establish if the suspected bomber was a foreigner.
If confirmed, it would be the second known case of a suicide attack in the Philippines in recent years, following a bomb in a van last July on neighboring Basilan island, which killed 11 people and was claimed by Islamic State.
Lorenzana said there was no connection between the church bombs and the mosque attack, echoing remarks by a local task force commander that it was ""not a retaliatory act"".
'COWARDICE AND OBSCENITY'
Zamboanga's Ulama Council called it ""devilish, irrational and inhumane"", while the regional governor condemned the church and mosque incidents and said an attack during prayers was the ""highest form of cowardice and obscenity"".
""We must stand united against the terrorists who would divide us and, thus, destroy all that we are working to build and establish in our communities,"" governor Mujiv Hataman said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Muslims are a minority in the predominantly Catholic Philippines and represent about a quarter of the population of the Mindanao region, where Communal violence is rare. 
The attacks follow a peaceful Jan. 21 referendum that overwhelmingly approved autonomy for the estimated 5 million inhabitants of predominantly Muslim parts of Mindanao that will be called ""Bangsamoro"", the culmination of a lengthy peace process between separatists and successive governments.
Duterte on Monday ordered the military to destroy the notoriously brutal Abu Sayyaf, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and is comprised of numerous cells with different agendas, some radical, others criminal.
He said he would not accept their surrender, adding ""the only way to fight them is to become evil also."" 
The military has identified several suspects and carried out an air strike on Jolo on Tuesday on an undisclosed target. 
The bombings, and Islamic State's claim of involvement, could stoke fears about the group's reach in Southeast Asia and about foreign fighters gravitating to Mindanao to capitalize on porous borders, jungles, and abundance of weapons and jobless, unschooled youth.

Martial law has been in place in Mindanao since a pro-Islamic State alliance overran Marawi City in 2017, in what was the Philippines' most intense battle since World War Two.

BRASILIA/BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Vale SA, the world's largest iron ore miner, on Tuesday vowed to take as much as 10 percent of its ore output offline in order to decommission 10 more dams like the one that burst last week, killing scores of workers and nearby residents.
Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said it would temporarily paralyze operations using those dams and spend 5 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to decommission them over the next three years. 
The move came as prosecutors began arresting Vale executives over the Friday collapse of a tailings dam in the Brazilian town of Brumadinho, which was hit by a torrent of mining waste that killed at least 84 people and left hundreds more missing. 
The disaster raised fresh questions about the company's commitment to safety after a similar deadly dam burst just over three years ago at a nearby mine it jointly owned. 
""We decided the company should, once and for all, do what it takes to remove any doubt about the safety of Vale's dams,"" Schvartsman told journalists in Brasilia.
The burst Brumadinho dam was one of 19 ""upstream"" tailings dams owned by Vale, all in the state of Minas Gerais, built with a method banned in Peru and Chile for safety reasons.
Vale had already begun the process of decommissioning nine of them. A corporate presentation seen by Reuters showed that the company had studied but did not implement several steps that could have prevented or lessened the damage from the Brumadinho disaster.
Schvartsman said Vale's board had approved the decision to decommission its 10 remaining upstream dams and suspend the related mining operations as necessary, relocating 5,000 workers to other parts of the company.
Those operations currently produce 40 million tonnes of iron ore and 11 million tonnes of pellets per year, he said. Vale forecast total iron output of 390 million in 2018.
FIRST ARRESTS
Earlier on Tuesday, police arrested three Vale employees, including two senior managers at the Corrego do Feijao mine in Brumadinho, as they began a criminal investigation into the disaster with an expected death toll of more than 300 people. Vale said it was cooperating with investigators in the case and the mining complex had been built to code, with equipment showing the dam stable two weeks before the disaster. 
Two other engineers, who worked for Germany's TUEV SUED on a contract where they attested to the safety of the Vale dam, were arrested in Sao Paulo, according to state prosecutors and a spokesman for the German firm. 
Minas Gerais state investigators issued a total of five arrest warrants and seven search warrants on suspicion of murder, falsification of documents and environmental crimes, a judge's decision showed. 
The collapse of the dam in the hilly, pastoral region has killed at least 84 people, according to firefighters' count on Tuesday evening, with another 276 missing and likely dead.
The search and recovery efforts have taken their toll on weary firefighters, helicopter pilots and volunteers.
José Eustáquio da Silva, 63, the head of cemeteries in Brumadinho, has also been working long days with the team digging the town's new graves with picks and shovels.
""All I see is sadness and hopelessness,"" he said, overlooking a hillside pocked with 98 fresh graves - only five of which had been filled.
'PREMEDITATED' 
Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani said Vale was doing all it could, offering money to mourners, extra tax payments to local government, a special membrane to remove mud from the river and major investments to make its dams safer. 
Yet residents in the devastated town of Brumadinho have been unmoved, watching in shock and anger as one dead body after another has been pulled from the mud. 
Following a deadly 2015 tailings dam collapse just a few towns over at a mine half-owned by Vale, the disaster remained unforgivable in the eyes of many Brazilians. 
At the headquarters for the local mining union, which lost more than one in 10 members by organizers' count, treasurer José Francisco Mateiro blamed the company and authorities for putting him and his comrades at risk. 
""They call it an accident but the design of those dams was premeditated,"" he said. ""There have been warnings about all mining dams for a long time now."" 
Still, prosecutors and politicians have not held their fire. 
Government ministers have said Brazil's mining regulations are broken. The country's top prosecutor said the company should be criminally prosecuted and executives held personally responsible.
On Monday, a presidential task force contemplated forcing out Vale's management, but by Tuesday senior officials pushed back on the idea.

""There aren't conditions for any degree of interference. It would not be a good signal to the market,"" presidential chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni said in a news briefing.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - For Marco Antonio Ribeiro da Silva, a 39-year-old maintenance worker at iron ore miner Vale SA, God took the form of a Toyota Hilux pickup truck last Friday afternoon.
Leaders at the local mining union in the Brazilian town of Brumadinho, where a tailings dam burst on Friday, likely burying over 300 people, describe the deeply devout father-of-two as one of the disaster's most unlikely survivors.
He is one of a handful of Vale workers who escaped from around a company cafeteria, which was packed when the dam gave way at lunchtime, releasing a wave of mining waste that crushed the facility. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Tlh0kR)
In a 45-minute interview on Tuesday, Ribeiro, who sports scars on his legs, arm and shoulder-blade from the ordeal, is quick to attribute his survival to his Christian faith. But even the less devout find his story — involving a last-second getaway on a pickup truck — miraculous.
""At the moment the disaster happened, I was right outside the restaurant,"" said Ribeiro. ""First, I saw water. And then I saw that mountain, two-and-a-half stories tall, coming down on top of us.""
Ribeiro had been sitting at a kiosk directly outside the entrance to the dining hall, greeting colleagues as they entered. He reckons nobody who went in made it out.
The initial wave of water, he said, sounded like the ocean. The wall of sludge that followed was roaring ""like a detonation that never ends.""
Ribeiro raced downhill alongside colleagues, while working his way toward the side of what would become the mud flow. As he picked up speed, he fell over, regained his footing and fell over again.
The second time he hit the dirt, he was sure it was over. 
""I had already given myself up for dead. I said, 'Mercy, mercy, mercy,' and I shouted, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.' And that's when I heard, 'Run to the pickup!'""
A Toyota pickup, loaded with about a dozen colleagues, appeared a few meters away. He said that for a moment the mud flow seemed to slow down as it smashed into several buildings.
Picking himself up, he was the last to arrive at the pick-up, grabbing onto colleagues as it sped up the side of the ravine and out of danger.
""I thought if I let go, I'll break my foot. And then die.""
Most of those who had been running alongside him were not so lucky. Among them, he said, was machine operator Wilson Jose da Silva, 53, a friend perhaps best-known for an internet video that shows him singing and dancing in a Vale locker room, which has gone viral since the disaster.
Unlike many in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, whose residents have suffered two disasters from dams linked to Vale in less than four years, Ribeiro holds no ill will toward the world's largest iron ore miner. He said he had always known the company to prioritize the safety of its workers.
Still, he recommends against living downstream of a dam.

""There's no such thing as a safe dam,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles school board voted on Tuesday to ask state lawmakers for a moratorium on new charter schools in the area, as demanded by a union for more than 30,000 teachers in a six-day strike that ended last week.
The 5-1 vote by the school board represented a dramatic shift for a panel on which at least half the members had previously supported charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately managed.
Charter schools operate in most of the United States with teachers who often are not represented by a union. 
United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), the union for teachers in the district, argued during a strike that won widespread support from parents and prominent Democratic politicians that charter schools are a vehicle for ""privatization"" of education and divert resources from traditional classrooms.
School district officials agreed to allow a vote on a request for a moratorium on charter schools, as part of the labor agreement it reached a week ago with UTLA to end the teachers strike.
The panel's approval of the motion, which also asks state officials to consider potential changes to California's legislation on charter schools, ensures the battle over the future of new charter schools in the nation's second-largest school district will move to the state capital of Sacramento.
PAUSE AND STUDY
Austin Beutner, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said in a statement he supported the resolution. 
""The charter law is decades old, and it makes sense to me to pause while experts – not advocates – study all of the issues and propose what adjustments, if any, might be appropriate to the law to provide a path for the next 20 years,"" Beutner said.
Los Angeles Unified has about 150,000 students in charter schools, more than any other school district in the nation. The resolution will not affect the continued operation of the district's 275 charter schools. 
The district has about 500,000 other students in regular public schools.
Representatives for California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and the state Department of Education could not be reached for comment. 
Charter school students and other supporters of those institutions protested on Tuesday at LAUSD headquarters ahead of the school board vote. 
""This resolution to ban charter schools is a solution in search of a problem,"" Myrna Castrejón, president and CEO of the California Charter School Association, said in a statement.

SAO JOAQUIM DE BICAS, Brazil (Reuters) - Miles (km) downstream from where a dam owned by miner Vale SA burst on Friday, killing hundreds, a small indigenous village in Brazil faces doubts about its very existence as the river at the center of life here runs dark with mining waste.
For members of the Pataxo-Hahahae tribe living at the end of a sinuous dirt road, fish from the Paraopeba River are the principal source of food. Villagers bathe and wash their clothes in its waters. 
But after a tailings dam at Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine burst upstream, burying communities and turning the river's once-clear waters a muddy brown, the 80 or so residents of the Pataxo-Hahahae village of Nao Xoha say they are unsure if they will be forced to uproot their families.
While there were no Pataxo-Hahahae among the 65 confirmed dead or 279 disappeared, the disaster, they fear, could be the end of their way of life.
""On Thursday, I was here washing my clothes, bathing with my children, and now I can't even touch the river,"" said Sot de Ionara Pataxo Hahahae, holding back tears.
""Our hearts are so sad knowing that nothing can be done.""
The Pataxo-Hahahae's plight comes as Brazil's current government, which took office earlier in January, has signaled it wants to cut mining regulations and shrink protections currently afforded to indigenous communities. For critics, the dam burst reveals the danger of both policies.
Brazil's indigenous affairs agency Funai said it is committed to helping Nao Xoha, by ensuring potable water among other measures.
But in the wake of the disaster, trust in the authorities here is low.

""You think some mining company is worried about this? Do you think some mayor is worried about this area?"" asked Sot de Aigoho Pataxo Hahahae. ""They only love money - and mining.""

Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group, claimed responsibility for the explosions. The group said it had targeted a police station with ""two strong bombs"", damaging a police car and motorcycle.
State news agency IRNA quoted the head of Sistan-Baluchestan police Mohammad Qanbari as saying the first explosion was caused by a percussion grenade. He said a ""suspicious package"" was also found on the street and exploded before being neutralized by a bomb disposal unit, injuring three police officers.
Zahedan is the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan province where Iranian security forces often clash with armed drugs smugglers and Sunni militants. The province is home to mostly Sunni ethnic Baluchis, a minority in predominantly Shi’ite Iran.
In October, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for kidnapping 10 Iranian security personnel including Revolutionary Guards in Sistan-Baluchestan. Some are still being held.
The group has said in the past that its attacks were retaliation for what it called the Iranian state’s oppression of Sunnis in Sistan-Baluchestan.
In September, the Revolutionary Guards killed four Sunni militants at a border crossing with Pakistan, including the second-in-command of Jaish al-Adl.
Shi'ite Iran has accused its regional Sunni rival Saudi Arabia of funding separatist groups on its territory. Riyadh has denied any involvement in Iranian internal affairs.

Earlier in January, the United Nations estimated that at least 890 were killed as a result of the violence, some of the worst in the area for years which highlighted the precarious state of inter-ethnic relations even in the Central African country's more peaceful regions.
A MONUSCO special mission looking into the circumstances of the fighting found at least 11 mass graves and 43 individual graves around the town of Yumbi and at least four communal graves containing at least 170 bodies in nearby Bongende, spokeswoman Florence Marchal said.
""While the conclusions of this mission are still being finalised, we are able to confirm that several hundred people including women and many children were killed in unbearable circumstances,"" she said.
""The speed, the modus operandi and the high death toll of this violence suggest that these events were planned and premeditated,"" she said.
A dispute linked to a tribal chief's burial is seen as a catalyst for the fighting between the Banunu and Batende communities. It led the government to cancel voting in the area for last month's presidential election.
While the bloodshed was not directly related to the Dec. 30 vote, a local activist told Reuters at the time that tensions between the two ethnic groups had festered because Batende leaders were supporting the ruling coalition while Banunu leaders backed opposition candidates.
Marchal said the area was now relatively calm, but warned: ""Tensions between the two communities are still very evident and are at risk of worsening.""
Safeguarding Congo's fragile security situation will be one of the key tasks for President Felix Tshisekedi, who was sworn in on Jan. 24 in Congo's first transfer of power via an election in 59 years of independence.
The country remains deeply unstable years after the official end of the 1998-2003 regional war in the eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi that led to millions of deaths, mostly from hunger and disease. Dozens of militia continue to ravage those areas.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday to discuss progress on resolving the war in Yemen and other regional issues, Saudi Press Agency reported.
The four-year war in Yemen pits the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement against the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people through military actions and other causes.
The United Nations is looking to rescue a deal struck in December between both sides to implement a troop withdrawal from Hodeidah port, the main entry point for Yemen's commercial and aid imports.
The Houthis control Hodeidah and troops of a Saudi-led coalition are massed on its outskirts. The warring sides disagree over who should control the city and port after forces withdraw.
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths acknowledged on Monday that proposed timelines on a pullout from the port have slipped and urged the warring parties to withdraw.
""The Secretary-General of the United Nations expressed his gratitude for the Kingdom's support in pushing for positive results in the dialogue between the Yemeni parties,"" SPA reported.
It was unclear if the call discussed an international inquiry led by the U.N. investigator on summary executions, Agnes Callamard, who has begun a week-long investigation in Turkey into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2.
Callamard said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had not yet approved a request for her to enter the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul and meet Saudi authorities.

The Sea Watch 3, run by a German humanitarian group, rescued the migrants from a rubber boat off the Libyan coast more than a week ago but Italy, which has closed its ports to charity ships, has refused to allow them ashore to request asylum.
""I want to thank the friendly countries that have in the last few hours said they are willing to find a shared solution,"" Conte told reporters in the Cypriot capital Nicosia. 
He named the countries as Germany, France, Portugal, Malta and Romania.
Similar stand-offs in the past have ended with several EU countries offering to each take in a share of migrants stranded on rescue boats.
French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking alongside Conte at a meeting of southern European countries, called for the ship to dock in the nearest safest harbor as quickly as possible, a clear reference to Italy, and for the migrants to then be shared out.
""France has always done it in a European framework. We are ready for it and I want to make it very clear this evening for this ship, and I want it to be very clear for all our Italian friends"", he said.
However, Conte said he had not given instructions for the migrants to be brought ashore in Sicily. He said that for now his government was ensuring they were looked after properly on the boat. 
The current situation is the second time in a month that Sea Watch 3, which flies a Dutch flag, has been stranded at sea with rescued migrants and no safe port. 
The last standoff ended after 19 days with the migrants allowed ashore in Malta and an agreement among eight EU countries, including Italy, to subsequently take them in.

Italy allowed rescue ships to dock regularly until June of last year, when the new government of the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement took office and cracked down on migrant arrivals, in line with the election promises of League leader Matteo Salvini.

HEBRON, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians in Hebron accused Israel on Tuesday of trying to rid the flashpoint city of witnesses to its actions in the occupied West Bank by ejecting a foreign observer force that helps safeguard residents.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that he will not renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH), accusing the observers of unspecified anti-Israel activity. The force has declined to comment.
Hebron, a Palestinian city of 200,000 people, is home to a community of around 1,000 Israeli settlers who are heavily guarded by a large Israeli military presence.
The TIPH was set up after a Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians at a Hebron shrine holy to both Muslims and Jews in 1994. The city has also seen stabbing and shooting attacks against settlers and Israeli soldiers by Palestinians.
Since Israel partially withdrew from Hebron in 1998 under interim peace deals with the self-rule Palestinian Authority, the TIPH has monitored ""breaches of the agreements (and) violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law,"" the force's website says.
""The settlers' attacks will increase,"" said Aref Jaber, a Palestinian resident of Hebron. TIPH's presence was particularly helpful to schoolchildren, he added, because they patrol the city ""in the morning and the afternoon, when they go to and return from school."" 
The United Nations said it regretted Israel’s decision.
""While the TIPH is not a United Nations body its role in contributing positively to defusing tensions in such a sensitive area has been widely recognized,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
TIPH draws staff from Norway, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The TIPH website says it has 64 international staff in the city. An Israeli official said its mandate ends on Jan 31. 
"" (TIPH) is our window to the world. They can show the Israeli occupation's ugly face – which is definitely annoying to the Israelis,"" said Bader Daour, a ceramics merchant in Hebron's old city.
Settler leaders welcomed news of the force's upcoming departure. They have accused the TIPH of harassing settlers and agitating against them. 
Yishai Fleisher, a spokesman for the Hebron Jewish community, said the TIPH observers ""created an atmosphere of conflict, not a congenial atmosphere of peace.""
Jews and Palestinians, he said, have inhabited the city for centuries: ""We know each other and I'm sure we'll find a way to get along without Norwegian help,"" Fleisher said.
Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said in November that the TIPH were pro-Palestinian, ""ignore Palestinian terrorism and harm IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers by documenting their daily security activity"". 
Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians collapsed in 2014. Most world powers consider Israel's settlements in the West Bank, territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war, to be illegal. Israel disputes this, citing biblical, historical and political ties to the land. 

""(The Israelis) don't want there to be witnesses to their crimes, or any other crime they commit against the Palestinians anywhere, and especially in Hebron,"" said the city's mayor of Tayseer Abu Sinaneh.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah has tendered his resignation and that of his unity government to President Mahmoud Abbas, he said on Tuesday, dealing a blow to faltering reconciliation efforts with Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas.
Abbas said in a statement that he accepted the resignation and that the government will ""continue its duties until the new government is formed.""
A Hamas official condemned the move as an attempt to marginalize and exclude the group from Palestinian politics.
Hamdallah, a little-known academic, headed the national unity government formed in 2014 and led the West Bank-based Fatah's reconciliation efforts with Hamas, which seized power in Gaza in 2007.
The two groups signed a reconciliation deal two years ago which set in motion a plan for Abbas's Palestinian Authority to resume governing in Gaza and take control of the coastal enclave's crossing points into Egypt and Israel.
But disputes over power-sharing and policy toward Israel have hampered the deal's implementation.

""The president will begin consultation to form a political government made up by factions of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) that will prepare for the holding of new parliamentary election,"" Abbas said.

PARIS (Reuters) - France is preparing for the return of dozens of French jihadists held by Kurdish authorities in Syria after the United States announced the withdrawal of its forces, its interior minister said on Tuesday, marking a shift in Paris' policy on the issue.
France, like other European nations, has been wrestling with how to handle suspected militants and their families seeking to return from combat zones in Iraq and Syria, as well as those in detention, after Islamic State lost huge swathes of territory.
Government policy until now has been to categorically refuse to take back fighters and their wives. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has categorized them as ""enemies"" of the nation who should face justice either in Syria or Iraq.
""The Americans are disengaging from Syria and there are people who are in prison and held because the Americans are there and they will be released. They will want to come back to France,"" Christophe Castaner told BFM TV.
""I want all those who return to France to be put immediately into the hands of justice,"" he added, responding to an unsourced report by BFM that 130 French jihadists will be released in the coming weeks. 
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have been backed by 2,000 U.S. troops and air support from nations including France, are holding about 150 French citizens in north-eastern Syria, including 50 adults, according to military and diplomatic sources.
Excluding families, officials estimate 250 French jihadists are still fighting in Syria, including 150 in the Hajin area, one of the final bits of territory held by Islamic State in eastern Syria, and 100 in Idlib province.
French officials in private say that they will have no choice but to change policy on citizens who went as jihadists to fight in the Middle East. Paris is already trying to repatriate minors on a case-by-case basis.
Washington's decision to withdraw from Syria quickly has left Paris fearing that French jihadists will either disperse or fall into the hands of the Syrian government if the Kurdish-led forces strike a peace deal with the government in Damascus. 
""Given the evolution of the military situation in north-east Syria, American decisions, and to ensure the safety of the French people, we are examining all options to avoid the escape and dispersion of these potentially dangerous people,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll told a daily briefing on Tuesday. 

As well as the headache of how to deal with returning jihadists, France is grappling with the threat of homegrown militancy after suffering a series of deadly militant attacks over the past three years.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo is ready for a compromise deal with Serbia to resolve long-standing issues between the countries, President Hashim Thaci said in a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump.
Serbia and its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, committed in 2013 to a European Union-sponsored dialogue aimed at resolving the situation but little progress has been made.
The talks have been halted since November when the government in Pristina raised customs tariffs on imports of locally-made products from Serbia by 100 percent. Serbia said it would not hold talks if the trade situation was not returned to normal.
“I will be ready and willing to make compromises necessary to reach a comprehensive and balanced settlement that will encompass all outstanding issues, thereby ending the century-old conflict with Serbia, and bringing peace to the whole region,” Thaci said in his letter dated Jan. 8. 
It remains unclear why Thaci published the letter now, days after he received a letter from Trump urging his Kosovo counterpart to do everything to reach a deal with Serbia two decades after the war ended.
Thaci said in June he would seek a solution with Serbia by “correcting borders”, but politicians and analysts in Kosovo said that would mean land swaps.
His plan rang alarm bells among Balkan neighbors and Western governments who saw it as a move to take three Serbian municipalities inhabited mainly by ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo’s population.
If there was a land swap Serbia would get part of northern Kosovo populated mainly by minority Serbs who refuse to recognize the authority of the Pristina government.
Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj has said he is not willing to change his government's decision on tariffs.
Washington remains the biggest supporter of Kosovo politically and financially.
It was under U.S. command that NATO bombed Serbian forces in 1999 to halt killings and the expulsion of Kosovo Albanians during a counter-insurgency operation.

Kosovo is recognized by around 110 nations, but not by Serbia, Russia and five EU member states.

PARIS (Reuters) - At the peak of France's ""yellow vest"" crisis, President Emmanuel Macron's wife and close aides were shown the Elysee Palace's nuclear-proof bunker in case the anti-government protesters attempted an assault on the presidency.
The startling revelation by Journal du Dimanche, which the president's office has not denied, shows just how anxious Macron's inner circle were over the challenge to his authority, as he sought a way to quell popular anger.
Six weeks on, Macron is back on the offensive and opinion polls point to a recovery in his battered popularity. Successful outings to a trio of townhall debates with local mayors and disenchanted voters have re-energized the president and lifted the gloom in his office.
In Bourg-de-Peage in the southern Drome region, Macron turned up unannounced at a local debate, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and for several hours explained his policies aimed at spurring growth and creating jobs.
""This was the Emmanuel Macron I remembered, the spirit from the campaign was back,"" one aide who worked with Macron during the 2016-2017 presidential campaign told Reuters.
The yellow vests, named after high-visibility vests French drivers must keep in their cars, had thrown Macron onto the defensive late last year. Their initial protests - against fuel tax hikes that Macron then scrapped - spiraled into a broader movement against the political elite and inequality, triggering some of the worst street violence in Paris in decades.
Despite the recovery in his fortunes, Macron told reporters on a flight to Egypt on Sunday that he still felt like he was ""walking on thin ice"".
That same day, however, 10,000 pro-government supporters marched in the rain in a riposte to the yellow vest protests.
It was a far cry from the million citizens who rallied in support of General Charles de Gaulle at a march that helped end the May 1968 uprising, but still a welcome sight for Macron supporters who had questioned whether he could bounce back. 
""A RATHER BEAUTIFUL MOMENT""
In another small victory for Macron, he appears for now to have changed the narrative coming out of France's influential 24-hour news channels.
BFM TV's ticker, which Macron's PR team obsesses over, went from ""Macron pushed to the wall"" in December to ""Will Macron emerge from this victorious?"" last weekend.
Even Macron's opponents acknowledge that he has performed well in the townhall sessions, part of a two-month long national debate Macron promises will influence policymaking, appearing self-assured and confident as the audiences grilled him. 
""In terms of form, the performance was a success,"" Damien Abad, a lawmaker for the center-right Les Republicains party told Reuters. ""It was a rather beautiful moment. But the French expect more than unanswered questions.""
An Ifop poll last week showed Macron's popularity up 4 points at 27 percent. Surveys have also shown his party back ahead of the far-right in voting intentions for the May European Parliament elections. 
But there is no guarantee that trend will continue, and the yellow vest protests rumble on. Some want to channel their energy into becoming a political force and aim to contest the May EU elections, though that decision has revealed deep splits within their amorphous movement. 
Macron, a former investment banker, has been told by advisers to avoid some of the cutting remarks that angered voters and made him look arrogant, but he is still prone to faux pas.
Moreover, further tough reforms lie ahead. Plans for stricter rules on unemployment benefits, a leaner public sector and a merging of varying pension plans into a single system could push voters back onto the streets. 
The polls suggest that Macron's increasingly tough response to the violent street marches has reassured conservative voters unnerved by the scale of the unrest. 
""In my constituency, I'm told 'we're not always for your policies, but we want this whole saga to end',"" Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, a lawmaker in Macron's La Republique En Marche, told Reuters.
""The French don't like chaos. The grand debate is a smart way to get out of this through the front door.""
Analysts warn, however, that Macron's national debate also risks raising expectations.

""Giving people a chance to speak is a big decision, and he'll have to show that it served a purpose,"" Ifop's Frederic Dabi said.

RIYADH (Reuters) - There are no ownership changes to any businesses belonging to Saudi-Ethiopian tycoon Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi following his release from more than 14 months in Saudi detention in an anti-corruption campaign, a family office spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday.
The spokesman said Amoudi was in good health and had met with senior management and other business associates, adding: ""It continues to be 'business as usual' for those businesses.""
Amoudi, whom Forbes once called the richest man in Ethiopia and the second-richest Saudi, was among scores of members of the Saudi business and political elite rounded up Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel in November 2017 on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Some detainees - like global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal - were released after agreeing secret settlement deals with the Saudi authorities, which say they expect to seize more than $100 billion this way.
Amoudi, in his 70s, became a multi-billionaire investing first in construction, agriculture and mining in Ethiopia, where he was born, and then purchasing oil refineries in Morocco and Sweden. Forbes valued his fortune at more than $10 billion in 2016.
New photographs shared by his family office showed Amoudi wearing a blue thobe (robe) and standing with business associates in front of photographs of King Salman, Prince Mohammed and the kingdom's founder.
His release followed that of several other businessmen last week and comes amid a global backlash over last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents and the reported torture of detained women activists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and has continued activity inconsistent with pledges to denuclearize, U.S. national intelligence chief Dan Coats said on Tuesday, apparently contradicting President Donald Trump's claims of big progress with Pyongyang.
The director of national intelligence's downbeat assessment, in testimony before a Senate committee, came just weeks ahead of a planned second summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The American president is hoping for a big foreign policy win from the meeting.
The annual Worldwide Threat Assessment from the Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI), released by Coats, noted that North Korea had not conducted any nuclear or missile tests in over a year and had declared its support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Pyongyang had also ""reversibly dismantled"" parts of its infrastructure for weapons of mass destruction, the report said.
""However, we continue to assess that North Korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and production capabilities, even as it seeks to negotiate partial denuclearization steps to obtain key U.S. and international concessions,"" it said.
""Our assessment is bolstered by our observations of some activity that is inconsistent with full denuclearization,"" Coats told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, adding that North Korean leaders saw nuclear arms as critical to survival of the regime.
The DNI report said that in his 2019 New Year’s address, Kim pledged that North Korea would ""go toward"" complete denuclearization and promised not to make, test, use, or proliferate nuclear weapons. 
However, it said Kim conditioned progress on ""practical actions"" by the United States and added that Pyongyang had in the past tied the idea of denuclearization to changes in diplomatic ties, economic sanctions, and military activities.
A landmark first summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore in June produced a promise by Kim to work toward the complete denuclearization of the divided Korean Peninsula. But progress has been scant.
Washington has demanded concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities. Pyongyang is seeking a lifting of international sanctions and an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War that ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
The White House has said Trump will hold a second summit with Kim around the end of February, but economic sanctions will be maintained.
On Jan. 19 Trump said he had had ""an incredible"" meeting with North Korea's nuclear envoy Kim Yong Chol in Washington and the two sides had made ""a lot of progress"" on denuclearization.

Earlier Tuesday, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, said relations with the United States would develop ""wonderfully at a fast pace"" if Washington responded to Pyongyang's efforts on denuclearization with trustworthy measures and practical actions.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>",A picture and its story: A boy injured in clashes in Gaza,"GAZA (Reuters) - More than two weeks after a projectile struck Mohammad An-Najjar's right eye during a Gaza border protest, the 12-year-old boy has only just learned that he will never see through it again.
    Lamia Abu Harb said that Palestinian medics told her that her son may need a glass eye.
The doctor who treated Najjar told Reuters that his retina was damaged beyond repair in the Jan. 11 incident, the aftermath of which was captured on camera by Reuters photographer Ibraheem Abu Mustafa.
It had been one of the quietest weeks in nine months of Gaza border protests before that Friday, when Najjar and his friends left their homes in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, and went to the nearest border protest site, as they often did on the weekend.
The boy said he did not take part in throwing stones or rolling burning tires, and that he went with his friends ""out of boredom.""
When Abu Mustafa arrived on the scene, east of Khan Younis, he took up position at what he felt to be a safe distance, in a place that by now he knew well.
As the clashes between Gaza protesters and Israeli troops intensified, Palestinians said Israeli soldiers fired toward protesters, who hurled stones at them and rolled burning tires at the border fence. 
Switching between lenses for distance shots and close-ups, Abu Mustafa began taking images. Some protesters covered their faces with T-shirts to protect against tear gas as some others ran away.
The first he knew that something happened was when people began shouting ""An injury, an injury,"" the photographer recalls.
""I continued to shoot pictures. A man was carrying a boy in his arms, and blood was coming from the boy's eye as he screamed,"" he said.
""Some images can still shock me,"" he added.
""I even muttered to myself as I continued to shoot, I said: 'The boy lost an eye, he lost his eye'.” 
The injured boy was Najjar. He said he was standing near the border fence when he was suddenly surrounded by tear gas. 
""I just wanted to turn around and run when something hit my eye, it was hard and painful,"" he said. 
Doctors said he was hit by a tear gas canister. His mother kept the news from him for a fortnight, until the boy went for a checkup ""and he heard doctors saying he was losing the sight of his eye."" 
Doctors who treated Najjar said that because of his age and the extent of the damage, he may have to get treatment outside Gaza.
Israel does permit some seriously ill Palestinians to cross through checkpoints into Israel for medical treatment, but no application has yet been made. Palestinian health ministry officials said they were still processing the paperwork ahead of a decision about a formal request to travel.
Harb, a mother of four, said: ""I just wish there was some hope. Doctors told me there isn't, but I hope we can get him out of Gaza for treatment,"" she said. 
An Israeli military spokeswoman had no information about specific incidents on Jan. 11, but referred to statements issued by the military that day that said troops had faced 13,000 ""rioters"" in several areas along the Gaza-Israel border, some throwing hand grenades and explosive devices.
The military said there had been ""many attempts to infiltrate and breach the fence"" that day, and warned Gazans not to try to breach it.
One Israeli soldier was lightly injured by stones and taken to hospital for treatment, the military said, adding that troops were ""responding by using riot dispersal means and according to the rules of engagement."" 
The Gaza protesters are demanding an end to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the narrow coastal strip, which is home to around two million Palestinians. They also seek the right to return to lands that Palestinians fled or were driven from upon Israel's founding in 1948.
Israel accuses the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, of orchestrating the protests along the border fence to provide cover for attacks and to distract from Gaza’s economic plight. Hamas denies the allegations.

The formation of a government nine months after an election is seen as a vital first step towards boosting confidence in the economy as political leaders warn of crisis. 
The International Monetary Fund has called for urgent fiscal reforms to address the country's large public debt, equivalent to about 150 percent of GDP.
""Matters are positive and will become clear within two days... This week is decisive, positively or negatively,"" Hariri was cited as saying in a statement from his office, adding that he was ""cautiously optimistic"".
The situation could not go on like this, and this week represented ""a last chance to settle things and to launch the government formation,"" Hariri was quoted as saying. 
Members of parliament from President Michel Aoun's party, the Free Patriotic Movement, said in a statement the government could be formed this week if concessions were made by all sides. 
If not, then ""next week we will have something else to say ... because then it will be clear that is an intention to obstruct the birth of the government"", the FPM's Cesar Abi Khalil said in a statement after a meeting of the MPs.
On Saturday, the leader of Lebanon's powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said ""extraordinary efforts"" were being made to form the government, but two obstacles remained - how to include a group of six Sunni lawmakers in the cabinet and the distribution of government portfolios among the political parties. 
Credit ratings agency Moody's last week downgraded Lebanon's sovereign debt, citing the uncertain movement towards forming a government, and Lebanese bonds have suffered in recent weeks. 

Lebanon is one of the world's most indebted countries and its finance minister has said it is in an economic crisis that has started to turn into a financial one, and hopes will not become a monetary one.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 10:48AM ET</span>","Trailing in polls, Ukraine's Poroshenko launches bid for second term","By Pavel Polityuk and Natalia Zinets
KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, whose popularity has plunged over rampant corruption and sliding living standards, launched his uphill fight for re-election on Tuesday, promising to steer his country toward the West and join the EU.
Polls show Poroshenko trailing the opponent he defeated five years ago, opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, a veteran former prime minister who has pledged to clamp down on graft, raise wages and lower household energy prices.
A 53-year-old confectionary magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, Poroshenko took power in the heady days of 2014 after a popular uprising that overthrew pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovich.
But his five years in power have been difficult. Russia responded to Yanukovich's fall by seizing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backing separatists in the east in a conflict which has killed at least 10,000 people and which remains unresolved despite a 2015 ceasefire.
The public has blamed a failure to fight corruption for the continuing fall of living standards in one of Europe's poorest countries. The average monthly wage is around $380 compared to $450 in the year before Poroshenko took office.
""The feeling of deep responsibility before the country, before contemporaries, before past and future generations prompted me to decide to run again for the presidency,"" Poroshenko told thousands of supporters on Tuesday.
While apologizing for mistakes, Poroshenko cast himself as the man to guard Ukraine against Russia and populism, and keep Ukraine on its Western course. Patriotic songs and videos, showing footage of soldiers at the front or the president meeting world leaders, preceded his speech. 
""None of my steps, successful or not, contradicted the strategy of a complete break with the colonial past, of Ukraine going its own way, of a civilization alliance with Europe,"" he said. ""And we have no right to stop halfway.""
Tymoshenko, a fiery speaker who was jailed under Kremlin-backed leader Yanukovich, launched her campaign last week. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a political novice who achieved fame as a comic actor, is also seen as a strong challenger.
Poroshenko is likely to promote himself as a less radical choice than Tymoshenko, whose plans for more state spending could set her on a collision course with the International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders who have pumped in billions to keep Ukraine's war-scarred economy afloat.
FATIGUE AND DASHED HOPES 
In the five years since the popular uprising that swept Yanukovich from power, Ukraine's heady optimism for change has faded. Seventy percent of Ukrainians believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a December survey. 
""There is fatigue from unfulfilled hopes,"" Iryna Bekeshkina, the director of the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, one of three organizations that carried out the survey, told Reuters. 
Poroshenko wants Ukraine to apply for EU membership in 2024. But while the West remains supportive of Ukraine, the country's prospects of joining the bloc any time soon are questionable. 
Poroshenko can boast some successes. He secured visa-free travel to the European Union for Ukrainians. He led efforts to create a national, independent Orthodox church that threw off centuries of ties to the Russian clergy. 
While he has not won the war in the east, as he had promised to do within weeks, he has not lost it either. The 2015 ceasefire has largely held despite regular deadly clashes. 
He successfully lobbied for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to supply lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine and for the EU and Washington to keep sanctions on Russia.
But corruption still festers, top officials suspected of bribe-taking have stayed out of jail, anti-corruption activists have been attacked and reforms sometimes stalled or reversed.
Poroshenko's re-election bid coincided with the release of watchdog Transparency International's latest Corruption Perception Index. Ukraine has climbed ten places since last year but still languishes in 120th place out of 180.

""This result is not consistent with fast European integration, reforms and elimination of corruption from all aspects of life to which our country claims to aspire,"" said the head of Transparency International Ukraine Andrii Borovyk.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 10:39AM ET</span>",Top Pakistan court upholds blasphemy acquittal of Christian woman,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the acquittal of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who spent years on death row after being convicted of blasphemy, dismissing a petition filed by Islamists who have called for her execution.
The decision leaves Bibi, who has been staying at an undisclosed location under tight security, free to leave Pakistan and seek asylum abroad.
""On merit, this petition is dismissed,"" Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa told the court, saying the petitioners, led by a village prayer leader, had failed to point out any mistake in the original judgment which he said had been based on false evidence.
In November, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was in talks with Pakistan about helping Bibi, however there was no confirmation of her whereabouts or intentions following the verdict.
The case, which drew worldwide attention, shone a spotlight on Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws and the often difficult conditions facing its Christian minority who make up 1.6 percent of the largely Sunni Muslim country of over 200 million.
Bibi, a farm worker, was convicted in 2010 of making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors working in the fields with her objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
Her conviction was overturned in October, prompting protests from religious hardliners calling for her death and demanding that the government prevent her from leaving the country.
Under pressure from days of protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, the government agreed to stop Bibi leaving the country until the Supreme Court considered the petition.
Bibi has been in hiding since the Supreme Court freed her in October, after eight years on death row. She has always denied committing blasphemy.
""FALSE EVIDENCE""
Hours before the Supreme Court decision, Shafeeq Ameeni, acting head of the hardline Tehreek-e Labaik group, which led the protests last year, issued a new warning to the court not to rule in favor of the ""blasphemer"".
Ameeni was not immediately available for comment after the ruling but in remarks in court, Chief Justice Khosa was severely critical of the petitioners' attempt to have the judgment reversed.
He said Bibi had been convicted on false evidence and pointed to discrepancies in testimony in the original case.
""You think we give the death sentence to someone on the basis of false evidence?"" Khosa said. ""Such lies were told that one statement doesn't match with another.""
""You start declaring someone deserves to be killed just on the basis of false evidence."" 
Rights group Amnesty International called for Bibi to be allowed to ""reunite with her family and seek safety in a country of her choice"".

""The authorities must also resist and investigate any attempts to intimidate the Supreme Court,"" said Amnesty International's South Asia campaigner, Rimmel Mohydin.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A senior Vatican official has resigned after a former nun accused him of soliciting sex from her a decade ago while hearing her confession, in another potentially embarrassing case of abuse for the Holy See.
The Vatican said on Tuesday that Father Hermann Geissler, an Austrian section head in the Vatican doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), had submitted his resignation but denied the accusation against him. The cardinal heading the CDF accepted his resignation, it said.
The case comes at a time when more nuns, encouraged by the MeToo movement, have been coming forward to describe abuse at the hands of priests and bishops. Last year, the International Union of Superiors General, which represents more than 500,000 Catholic nuns, urged their members to report abuse.
""Fr. Geissler decided to take this step to limit the damage already done to the Congregation and to his Community (religious order),"" the Vatican said in a statement. ""He affirms that the accusation made against him is untrue.""
The Vatican statement said a Church investigation of the case was underway but did not comment on the accusations made against Geissler.
Geissler could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Doris Wagner, a German who entered a convent when she was 19, made her accusation at a November conference in Rome on giving a greater voice to women survivors of clergy sexual abuse.
CONFESSION
Wagner said she had been propositioned by the priest during confession in 2009, when she was 25. She said the priest told her how much he liked her and he believed she liked him and that, although they could not marry, there were ""other ways"".
Wagner, who is now married with a child, said the priest tried to hold and kiss her during confession but she ran away.
Although she did not name the priest during the conference, Wagner said he was a section head at the CDF and a member of the same religious order to which she also belonged, Familia Spiritualis Opus (FSO). Geissler was the only section head at the CDF who belonged to the FSO, which Wagner left in 2011.
In an email to Reuters on Tuesday, Wagner confirmed that the priest was Geissler and said that if a Church investigation was underway that deals ""with 'my' case, I would like to be a part of it"".
Wagner provided Reuters with a copy of a 2014 letter to her from a German Church official which said the priest had been admonished for ""imprudent gestures on two occasions that he admitted and for which he asked pardon"".
Solicitation is a serious crime under Church law. It refers to when a priest uses the pretext of the sacrament of confession to commit an immoral act with a penitent or seeks to commit one. It is punishable by expulsion from the priesthood.

The deal was one of several concluded during a visit to Damascus by Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, whose country's support has been vital to President Bashar al-Assad during the war.
Shunned by Western states that backed the opposition, Damascus is looking to countries such as Iran, Russia and China to help rebuild. But banking transactions between Syria and Iran have been affected by Western restrictions on their access to the international financial system.
Addressing an Iranian-Syrian business forum in Damascus, Jahangiri said ""ministers confirmed that banking transactions will take place very soon between the countries"".
In comments circulated by Iranian state media, Abdolnaser Hemmati, Iran's central bank governor, said the agreement enabled banks to conduct transactions in their local currencies and non-dollar foreign currencies.
Iran has supported Damascus in the war through the deployment of its own forces in addition to Tehran-backed Shi'ite militias such as Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Mohammad Saeed Shahmiri, an executive with the Iranian company Saab Niroo which specializes in building infrastructure, said his firm was studying projects in and around Damascus but described the banking issue as the ""most important problem"".
""We hope if they solve this problem, immediately we can start the project here,"" Shahmiri told Reuters at the forum. 
Keyvan Kashefi, chairman of an Iranian-Syrian chamber of commerce, said Iran and Syria had not had strong banking ties in the past few years. 
""This issue was constantly raised by the private sector of both countries,"" he said.
""It was announced today that some agreements have been reached. And the banks of the two countries can now help businessmen and industrialists with financial exchanges and this problem of ours will be solved.""
Mohamad Hamsho, a businessman and chairman of the Syrian chambers of commerce, said agreements had been concluded to ""overcome obstacles with respect to the banking activity between Iran and Syria"".
Helped by Russia and Iran, the government has crushed rebel enclaves across much of Syria, leaving a corner of the northwest in the hands of anti-Assad insurgents. Kurdish-led forces that are not hostile to Damascus control much of the east and north.

Cities in the Midwest opened warming shelters as temperatures plummeted well below zero degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17.8 degrees Celsius). Regional governments closed hundreds of schools and airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights, including those to Atlanta just days before the National Football League's Super Bowl.
The Midwest will be the hardest-hit area, with wind chill bringing temperatures down as low as minus 50F (minus 46C) in the Chicago area and northern Illinois by Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service reported.
As much as two feet (60 cm) of snow was forecast in Wisconsin, and six inches (15 cm) in Illinois.
""Listen to the people in your area ... We're taking about what could be a very dangerous situation, especially for those traveling,"" NWS forecaster Jim Hayes warned on Tuesday.
He said frostbite was possible within 10 minutes in the intense cold, and that it would take several days for temperatures to increase significantly.
The brutal cold was caused by the polar vortex, a mass of freezing air that normally spins around the North Pole, but has made its way south into the United States.
Washington D.C., Alabama and Mississippi will also experience some snowfall this week, forecasters said.
Parts of north and central Georgia may see about 2 inches (5 cm) or more of snow in the coming days, along with freezing rain and ice-slicked highways. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp shut government offices in 35 counties on Tuesday, and schools across swaths of the state were also closed.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) on Monday canceled 170 flights for the city's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport for de-icing efforts ahead of the storm.
Half of the flights out of Chicago's Midway International Airport were canceled on Tuesday, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.
Blizzard conditions were predicted across parts of the western Ohio Valley and snow was expected through Wednesday from the Great Lakes region into New England.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",UK PM May asks lawmakers to send a message to Brussels on Brexit deal,"By Kylie MacLellan, William James and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will ask her Conservative Party lawmakers on Tuesday to send a message to Brussels that they would support her Brexit deal if a plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland is replaced.
Parliament will try to shape the future of the country's exit from the European Union by debating and voting on what changes they want May to seek to her deal.
With exactly two months until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, there is no agreement yet in London on how and even whether to leave the world's biggest trading bloc after May's plan was rejected by an overwhelming majority in parliament.
On Tuesday, May will address parliament before about five hours of debate on her future plans, setting out why she believes lawmakers should back steps to reopen the agreement with the EU and renegotiate the so-called backstop.
Brussels has repeatedly said it does not want to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which has been signed off by the other 27 EU leaders, and has said there must be a guarantee to ensure there is no return to a hard border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
May's spokesman said her strategy had won the backing of her cabinet.
""The prime minister said that in order to win the support of the House of Commons legal changes to the backstop will be required, that would mean reopening the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he told reporters.
It is not a foregone conclusion that lawmakers will back the proposal or amendment authored by senior Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady to call for the backstop to be removed and replaced with ""alternative arrangements"" during a series of votes, which are due to start at 1900 GMT.
Tuesday's votes are not a rerun of the Jan. 15 vote on whether to approve May's Brexit deal, but a chance to discover what sort of changes would be required to win the support of parliament, so the prime minister can try to renegotiate the agreement in Brussels.
Other lawmakers are also looking at ways to wrest control of Brexit from the government, with the main opposition Labour Party throwing its weight behind a bid by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, increasing its chances of success.
Another faction, led by both Conservative pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers, are trying to come up with a new plan for Brexit - to return to Brussels with two new options.
It calls for the backstop to be renegotiated or if that fails to leave on World Trade Organization rules at the end of 2021.
CLEAR MESSAGE 
Strong support for the Brady amendment will allow May to demonstrate to the EU that changes to the backstop could be enough to allow her to get parliamentary approval for a deal. 
""If the prime minister indicates in the debate that she will be pressing Brussels to reopen the WA (Withdrawal Agreement) to make changes to the backstop, I will gladly support the Brady amendment,"" former foreign secretary and prominent Brexiter Boris Johnson said on Twitter.
The EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said on Monday the bloc was ""open to alternative arrangements"" on the Irish border but that Brady's proposal did not spell out what they were.
Brady's amendment is not certain to pass, as a group of prominent pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers have said they are yet to decide whether they will support it. 
The small Northern Irish party which props up May's minority government but opposes her deal, said the contents of May's speech to lawmakers on Tuesday will determine whether it will support the amendment.
Lawmakers have proposed more than 10 different amendments to be debated on Tuesday but only a small number are likely to be chosen to be voted on. Voting will begin at 1900 GMT.
Aside from Brady's proposal, the other key amendment expected to garner a large amount of support, possibly enough to be approved by parliament, is one put forward by Cooper.
Cooper's amendment seeks to shift control of Brexit from May's government to parliament and if successful could have a profound effect, giving lawmakers who want to block, delay or renegotiate Brexit a possible legal route to do so.

If a subsequent piece of legislation is passed, it would give May until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament or face a vote on whether to ask the EU to delay Britain's exit to avoid leaving without a deal on March 29.

QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria are pinned down in a final tiny pocket with their wives and children, forcing a U.S.-backed militia to slow its advance to protect civilians, the militia said on Tuesday.
An aid agency said separately that 10,000 civilians had fled the enclave since last week and were arriving hungry and desperate at a camp.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have been backed by 2,000 U.S. troops and air support, are preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State in eastern Syria after helping to drive the fighters from the towns and cities that once formed the group's self-proclaimed caliphate.
SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said Islamic State fighters were now confined to a pocket of just 5-6 square km (around 2 square miles) by the Euphrates River. The presence of their wives and children meant the U.S.-backed militia could not launch an all-out storm of it, and was using slower, more precise tactics instead.
""There are thousands of Daesh families there. They are civilians at the end of the day,"" Bali told Reuters, using an acronym for Islamic State. ""We cannot storm the area or put any child's life in danger.""
The SDF had refused an offer from the jihadists via mediators to surrender the territory in return for safe passage out, Bali said.
Clashes had slowed because of the presence of the civilians, and ""precise operations"" were taking more time. ""Calm prevails on the frontlines but there's a state of caution and waiting."" 
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) charity said it was helping tend to a sudden influx of more than 10,000 people, almost all women, children and elderly, who had arrived at a camp in northeast Syria since last week.
Most were exhausted, extremely hungry, and thirsty as they fled Islamic State territory, the global aid agency said. Many arrived barefoot. The United Nations confirmed that 12 young children had died after reaching the al-Hol camp or on the dangerous journey there, the IRC added on Tuesday.
The SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has seized much of north and east Syria with U.S. help. It has been battling Islamic State remnants near the Iraqi border for months.
Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Islamic State had been defeated and announced the abrupt withdrawal of the U.S. troops, over objections of top advisors including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who quit in protest.
The SDF vowed to escalate its operations against Islamic State this month after a bomb attack killed several people including two U.S. soldiers in northern Syria. SDF officials have warned of an Islamic State revival if Washington withdraws. 

Kurdish leaders also fear a U.S. pullout would give Turkey, which sees the YPG as a threat on its border, the chance to mount a new assault. Washington has since said it will make sure its allies are protected when it leaves.

HARARE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Zimbabwean lawyers marched on Tuesday to demand justice for people detained in jail and others facing fast-track trials after violent protests this month led to mass arrests and a brutal security crackdown.
Police say more than 1,000 people have been arrested since Jan. 14, when a three-day stay-at-home strike called after President Emmerson Mnangagwa raised fuel prices led to street violence and looting. Those charged have been denied bail in a pattern lawyers say is a violation of their rights.
Pressure group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human rights (ZLHR) says the arrests and detentions, most for public order offences, have exceeded the legal system's capacity. Lawyers have been unable to extend representation to several hundred detainees including children.
Close to 50 people have been acquitted on charges of public violence while an equal number have been convicted and sentenced to as much as seven years, ZLHR said, adding that those found guilty did not have lawyers.
Mnangagwa last week pledged to investigate the security crackdown, during which residents and other witnesses say police and soldiers conducted night-time raids on many homes and forcibly removed and beat alleged protesters.
On Monday, Mnangagwa said he had ordered the arrest of a soldier and police officer filmed assaulting a man in handcuffs.
The opposition has, however, cast doubt on the president's promises, saying no one has yet been brought to account for the death of six people shot by the military after post-election violence last August.
Rights groups say at least 12 people were killed during this month's unrest while police put the figure at three.
The country is also mired in economic crisis, and concerns are growing that frustration over that could lead to more unrest after public workers on Monday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the government to meet their pay demands or face a strike.
'JUSTICE NOT POLITICS'
On Tuesday, some of the lawyers marching through Harare carried placards emblazoned with the words: ""Systemic beatings, detentions silence the rule of law"" while another sign read ""#No to judicial capture, #justice not politics; #no to militarization of magistracy"".
They walked from the Law Society of Zimbabwe offices to the Constitutional Court, where they presented a petition while riot police looked on.
Zimbabwe's High Court was set to make a ruling later on Tuesday on a bail application by activist pastor Evan Mawarire, detained at a maximum security prison in Harare on subversion charges after he tweeted his support for the stay-at-home strike.
Mawarire, who first came to prominence as a critic of former leader Robert Mugabe, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
The crackdown has alarmed rights groups who fear a return to the authoritarian regime that characterized much of the Mugabe era.
The government has alleged that the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is behind the demonstrations, something its leader Nelson Chamisa denied.

Zimbabwe was witnessing ""an escalation, not only of Mugabe-type of terror but ... something that will make Mugabe look like a baby in terms of terrorism,"" Chamisa told reporters.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Philippine president suggests church bombing was 'suicide' attack,"By Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Tuesday twin explosions that killed 20 people in a church on a southern island at the weekend may have been a suicide attack, citing a briefing given to him by military commanders.
Duterte's comments run counter to statements by military and police officials on Tuesday, who said the bombs inside and outside of the church in Jolo appeared to have been detonated remotely. Security camera footage of suspects believed to have planted the bombs has been shown to media.
If confirmed, it would be one of the first known cases of a suicide attack in the Philippines and would be consistent with details of a claim of responsibility by Islamic State via its Amaq news agency early on Monday. 
""It exploded. That is terrorism and suicide. You cannot carry plastic bags, you will be questioned by the military, police when you have backpack,"" Duterte said when asked by reporters to clarify an earlier remark.
He added: ""But you could see all around bits and pieces of flesh. We even stepped on it.""
Asked separately about Duterte's comment, Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said it was possible the second blast ""may have been a suicide bomber"".
""The first bomb that exploded inside the church was apparently left behind by a certain woman,"" he said.
""The second bomb that exploded at the entrance about a minute and a half after, may have been a suicide bomber as indicated by body parts strewn all over,"" Lorenzana said.
The bombings came six days after a referendum on autonomy for the mainly Muslim region returned an overwhelming ""yes"" vote. 
More than 100 people were wounded along with the 20 killed in Jolo in what was one of the deadliest attacks in recent years in a region long plagued by instability.
Islamic State said last year it was behind what it called a suicide bombing, when a device was detonated by the driver of a van when he was stopped at an remote checkpoint in Basilan. It killed 11 people. 
The driver was believed to be a foreigner, and may have triggered the device prematurely, according to security officials, who say the intended target was likely a more populated area.
Duterte said he was certain the militant Abu Sayyaf group was responsible for the church attack and that it was possible, though not certain, that one of the bombers was Indonesian.
He appeared to have some doubts about the mode of the attack, based on the information from a briefing he said he had received at 3 a.m. on Tuesday.
""If not suicide bomber, what? By cellphone? Yes, that is a possibility. But the eyewitnesses said it was the other way around. There could have been a companion, a support system,"" he said.
Police believe an Abu Sayyaf faction called Ajang-Ajang carried out the attack in revenge for the deaths of relatives killed during military operations against the group.

Abu Sayyaf is a domestic militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and engages in kidnap for ransom and piracy.

The migrants had been living in tents under a bridge next to the ""Peripherique"" ring road that circles the city's 20 districts, and consented to being moved.
The refugees, who were mainly from Africa and Afghanistan, packed up their tents and belongings and boarded coaches. 
""They will get a medical check, and then we will be looking at their administrative situation and according to their rights, they will be sent to centers,"" said local official Bruno Andre. 
France has repeatedly cleared migrant camps in Paris and along its northern coast.
In late October 2016, France razed a sprawling migrant camp outside the port of Calais that served as a launch pad for refugees seeking to enter Britain hidden in trucks, trains and ferries.
The numbers trying to reach Britain increased sharply last year compared with 2017 but remained a tiny fraction of those attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey.
French authorities say they take a tough approach to discourage people from returning to the northern coast.

Europe has faced a migrant crisis since 2015 following wars in Libya and Syria, and more than 1 million people from Africa and the Middle East have tried to reach the continent via Turkey or by sea.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:49AM ET</span>","Iran rejects talks on missiles, but says no plan to increase range","LONDON (Reuters) - Iran on Tuesday dismissed pressure from France and other Western powers for talks over its ballistic missile program, but said it had no plans to increase the range of the weapons.
France said last week it was ready to impose further sanctions on Iran if no progress was made in talks about the missiles, described by Tehran as defensive but seen in the West as a destabilizing factor in a volatile region. 
""Negotiations over Iran's missile and defensive capabilities are not acceptable in any way,"" Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, a top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency.
He said French leaders were only raising the issue to distract attention from anti-government demonstrations in their country. Iran on Monday denied that it was holding any talks with France about the missiles.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions, saying the accord did not address the missiles and what he saw as the Islamic republic's malign influence on the region.
France, along with other signatories, stuck with the accord, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. But Paris and other European powers have also raised concerns about the missiles, fearing they could one day reach their territories.
“The enemies say Iran’s missile power should be eliminated, but we have repeatedly said our missile capabilities are not negotiable,” Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency, using a phrase usually applied to the United States and Israel.
SATELLITES
The secretary of Iran's National Security Council said Iran would keep working to improve the missiles' accuracy.
""Iran has no scientific or operational restriction for increasing the range of its military missiles, but based on its defensive doctrine, it is continuously working on increasing the precision of the missiles, and has no intention to increase their range,"" Ali Shamkhani, another close aide to Khamenei, was quoted as saying by state broadcaster IRIB.
In November 2017, the deputy head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned that it would increase the range of its missiles beyond 2,000 km (1,200 miles), if Europe threatened Iran.
A U.N. Security Council resolution that accompanied the 2015 nuclear deal ""called upon"" Tehran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons.
But Iran said that call did not amount to a binding order and has denied that its missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 
Washington has also told Tehran to stop developing satellite-launching technology, saying it was concerned that the same gear could also be used to launch warheads.
Shamkhani said Iran would keep working on the technology ""to improve the quality of people’s lives and increase the country's technological prowess.""

Telecoms Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said on Tuesday that an Iranian satellite, called Friendship, will be launched soon. Another launch failed earlier this month.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: The Brexit backstop and why it matters,"By Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A ""backstop"" mechanism for Northern Ireland's land border with the European Union is a stumbling block for British lawmakers to endorse Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal with the European Union.
This is what it is and why it matters:
BOTH SIDES WANT TO AVOID A ""HARD BORDER"" - WHAT'S THAT?
In 1998, Britain and Ireland made the Good Friday agreement to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland over whether it should stay British or join the Irish Republic to the south. That ended controls along the 500-km (300-mile) land border and set up all-Ireland rules and institutions that make Northern Ireland special within the United Kingdom. Brexit means possible new checks along the border and a bombing this month by a new anti-British group has raised fears of a return to violence.
SO THE SOLUTION IS...?
Prime Minister May says a special customs and trade arrangement with the EU, to be negotiated during a status-quo transition of 20 to 44 months, will ensure seamless borders between all the United Kingdom and EU -- so there will be no need for intrusive checks on goods at the Irish border.
THAT SOUNDS FAIR - SO WHAT'S THE CATCH?
The Irish government, backed by the rest of the EU, wants an insurance policy in case those future trade talks fail.
AND THAT INSURANCE POLICY IS WHAT?
The Withdrawal Agreement May struck in November with the EU says the UK will remain in a customs union ""unless and until"" ""alternative arrangements"" are found to avoid a hard border. The EU had proposed keeping only Northern Ireland in its economic area but May and the pro-British Belfast party that gives her a slim parliamentary majority objected, arguing that it would set Northern Ireland on a course toward union with the Republic.
BUT BRITISH LAWMAKERS OBJECT?
Many dislike the prospect of being bound to EU rules and customs duties that would prevent Britain doing its own trade deals and leave it overseen by EU judges. May has pushed the EU to put a time limit on the backstop, possibly in 2021. Some EU governments have considered such a deadline - perhaps more like 2025 - but Ireland and all other EU leaders have rejected that.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
No one knows. There is little sign May can reverse the huge defeat the treaty suffered in parliament two weeks ago. The EU says it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement or the backstop protocol within it, but could rework the political declaration setting out post-Brexit trade terms that may offer a clearer way of avoiding the backstop -- say by keeping the UK in a customs union. That, however, remains anathema to May.
AND IF THERE IS NO DEAL?
If no one gives ground, Britain will leave the EU on March 29. Ireland and Britain say they have no plan to impose customs controls that would be an immediate target for militants. But the EU has said that no deal means a hard border, of some kind.
SO IRELAND IS IN A BIND?

Very much so. Its EU partners insist they will stand by it and defend the backstop. But they also want to avoid a no deal. If there were no deal, Ireland would not be able for long to let the only EU land border with the UK stand open. If it failed to check goods coming in from Britain, Ireland itself could find the EU raising questions on whether Irish exports to the rest of the Union should remain free of all checks at their ports.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>","Italy's Salvini opposes migrant trial, puts ally in bind","By Giselda Vagnoni
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Tuesday urged the upper house Senate to reject a request by judges to put him on trial for alleged kidnapping after he refused to let migrants disembark from a rescue ship, saying he had acted in the public interest.
His appeal is likely to cause strains with his coalition partner, the 5-Star Movement, which has always presented a squeaky clean judicial image and lambasted lawmakers who try to use parliamentary privilege to avoid legal action.
A special tribunal which reviews investigations involving government ministers last week called for Salvini to stand trial for alleged abuse of power and kidnapping over his role last year in detaining some 150 migrants on board a rescue boat for a week.
A Senate committee is due to meet on Wednesday to start discussions on whether to lift Salvini's parliamentary immunity with a vote expected by the end of February.
Its recommendation will pass to the full Senate for review, with 5-Star lawmakers holding the balance of power in both the commission and the chamber.
In a letter to Corriere della Sera newspaper published on Tuesday, Salvini, who is also head of the far-right League party, urged the upper house to reject the request.
Citing constitutional law, Salvini said the Senate could protect ministers if they had acted in the public interest.
""This is not about me. ...Fighting illegal immigration is of pre-eminent public interest,"" Salvini wrote. ""I am convinced I acted in Italy's best interests and in full respect of my mandate. I would do it again."" 
His request puts the 5-Star, which has broadly supported Salvini's migration policies, in a tight corner as tensions grow between the coalition parties. 
5-Star built its support partly on the back of its fierce campaigns against parliamentary abuse and in the last legislature, when it was in opposition, it demanded that ministers under legal investigation should resign.
Salvini, who faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty, indicated last week that he would be happy to go on trial -- a suggestion that gave 5-Star lawmakers political cover to vote for his parliamentary immunity to be lifted.
That cover has now gone and there was no immediate comment from the 5-Star leadership on what stance it would adopt.
Italy has taken in more than 650,000 boat migrants since 2014, but the influx has slowed dramatically since the new government took office last June and shut its ports to rescue boats that pick up migrants off the coast of Libya.

The stand-off over the 150 migrants aboard the Diciotti coastguard ship last August signaled the government's new hardline approach. The group of refugee seekers were allowed to land after the Roman Catholic church, Ireland and Albania agreed to take care of them.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's ""yellow vests"" suffered the first setback to their ambitions to contest May's European elections after one of 10 candidates and their campaign director quit following a barrage of attacks from within the divided protest movement.
The withdrawals come less than a week after a small group within the movement announced its list in a move which exposed deep splits about whether and how to become a more organized political force.
Campaign chief Hayk Shahinyan said elections could present an opportunity for the ""yellow vests"", whose anti-government protests have challenged President Emmanuel Macron's authority, provided the loose-knit movement prepared properly.
But he expressed doubts over whether this was the case.
""I have taken the decision to withdraw from my activities ... and take a week to analyze, reflect and prepare my next steps,"" Shahinyan wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
One opinion poll last week showed the ""yellow vests"" could prove a disruptive force in the European elections, stealing votes from the far-right and so inadvertently help Macron, whose liberal economic reforms triggered their original protests.
But some activists have accused the candidates of betraying the movement.
One, Marc Dunoyer told the Journal du Dimanche paper that he was quitting the candidate list because of death threats over his support for Macron during the 2017 presidential race, even if he was now ""disappointed"" by the former investment banker. 
The ""yellow vests"", named after high-visibility vests French drivers must keep in their cars, began their protests in November against fuel taxes and the high cost of living. 
The movement quickly morphed into a broader rebellion against the political elite and inequality, leading to some of the worst violence seen on French streets in decades.

But it is split along open faultlines: between radicals who want to oust Macron and moderates who back dialogue, and between those who wish it to remain a grassroots, apolitical movement and those who see an opportunity to break into politics.

SEOUL (Reuters) - At 93, Kim Bok-dong died as she had lived for many years: at the heart of the controversy over Japan's use of forced labor in its wartime brothels.
Kim, who died on Monday at a hospital in the South Korean capital of Seoul, was a fixture at weekly protests outside the Japanese embassy calling for a sincere apology and compensation.
She remained angry at Japan until the end, her supporters said.
""She suddenly opened her eyes yesterday and told a long story ... I couldn't decipher everything but one thing I could hear clearly was that we had to fight until the end,"" said Yoon Mee-hyang, who leads an advocate group for the women.
""Then she expressed strong anger toward Japan as she continued talking, before she regained her tranquillity,"" Yoon told Reuters. 
Kim was among the two dozen known surviving South Korean ""comfort women"", a Japanese euphemism for women who were forced into prostitution and sexually abused at Japanese military brothels before and during World War Two.
Activists say they plan to march alongside Kim's casket past Japan's embassy on Friday, a demonstration that could further strain ties between Seoul and Tokyo.
The two Asian neighbors share a bitter history stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said during his visit to Kim's funeral home on Tuesday it was ""heartbreaking"" that victims die without a resolution of the issue.
In a separate post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Moon said Kim revealed a ""hidden history"" by becoming one of the first victims to come forward in 1992.
Kim was 14 when she was first sent to a military brothel, and forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers also in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, according to Yoon.
""SINCERE APOLOGY""
Articulate and charismatic, Kim was a vocal critic of a 2015 deal in which Tokyo apologized to the victims and provided one billion yen ($9.1 million) to a fund in Seoul to help them. 
Kim said it was not sincere because some Japanese leaders continued to deny the women were forced to work in brothels.
""We won't accept it even if Japan gives 10 billion yen. It's not about money. They're still saying we went there because we wanted to,"" Kim told a parliamentary session in September 2016. 
Moon's government has said it will not seek to renegotiate the 2015 deal. Last year it vowed to shut down the Japan-sponsored fund and pursue a more ""victim-oriented"" approach. 
Japan says the claims have been settled by past agreements and apologies, and that the continued dispute may threaten relations between the two countries.
Only 23 registered South Korean survivors are still alive, highlighting a sense of urgency behind efforts by the women to receive a formal apology and legal compensation from Japan while their voices can still be heard.
Just hours before Kim passed away, a fellow victim only identifiable by her surname Lee had died, Yoon said. 
Kim's defense of victims' rights earned the respect of one South Korean diplomat involved in their case. 
""She was clever and unwavering under any circumstances,"" said the diplomat who did not want to be named.

""All she wanted was genuine atonement, and we fully respected it and felt sorry even when she wasn't happy with our work.""

Since winning power last May, Mahathir has repeatedly vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls ""unfair"" Chinese projects authorized by predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat amid a massive financial scandal. 
The cabinet has decided to cancel the contract with China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) for the East Coast Rail Link project, economic affairs minister Mohamed Azmin Ali said last week.
""We seek understanding from the parties concerned,"" Mahathir told reporters on Tuesday, adding that Malaysia was burdened with ""heavy debt"" and could not afford the project, one of the biggest signed in China's signature Belt and Road initiative.
""It is not because we want to frustrate or throw out the contract, it is because we are really tight in terms of finance.""
The contract may cost the country more than 100 billion ringgit ($24.33 billion) in total, Mahathir said, adding that Malaysia would still have to pay a cancellation fee.
""The huge compensation is not as huge as the amount of debt we will carry for the next 30 years.""
The government was still determining how much to pay CCCC as cancellation fee, Azmin said last week. Government officials have previously said the project cost had been inflated. 
In Beijing this week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware of the project cancellation. 
On Tuesday, Mahathir said an official statement is to be issued in the next few days, with the finance ministry to provide a detailed explanation soon. 
In August Mahathir had said the project would be canceled ""for now"", but the government later said it was in talks with CCCC on the future of the rail line. 

Mahathir has blamed Najib's administration for taking total government debt and liabilities to more than 1 trillion ringgit, including that of scandal-plagued state fund 1MDB, which is being investigated for corruption in at least six countries.

Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on executions who is on a week-long mission to Turkey, briefly visited the Istanbul neighborhood where the Saudi consulate is located but did not enter the premises.
""We just wanted to have a sense of it,"" she told reporters.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist living in the United States, was killed on Oct. 2 at the Saudi consulate, where he had gone to collect documents for his planned wedding.
Speaking outside the building, Callamard said she had requested access to the premises from the Saudi government and to meet Saudi authorities both in Turkey and in the kingdom.
""To be fair the request to them has come quite late, so we need to give them a bit more time to process our request,"" she said. ""We are respectfully calling on the authorities to give us access at some stage while we are here.""
U.S. intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler, and say his body was dismembered and removed to a location still publicly unknown.
Riyadh denies that the prince had any involvement.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said on Monday that Callamard is investigating what evidence there is pointing to Prince Mohammed's responsibility. He also called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to share its intercepted recordings of the crime.
Callamard met Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and the head of Turkey's National Intelligence Agency (MIT) separately on Monday. Turkish officials have not said what evidence they shared with her.
She is expected to meet the Istanbul chief prosecutor, who has headed the local investigation, later on Tuesday.

She said she could publish her report by late May although the date could change.

The committee's decision must then be endorsed by the full parliament next month, which is also likely as other EU institutions have backed a move to relaxed visa requirements for Britain after Brexit, provided London reciprocates.
The parliamentary notion covers both a scenario under which Prime Minister Theresa May breaks the deadlock at home and manages to get the divorce deal she had negotiated with the EU ratified in the UK parliament, as well as a no-deal Brexit. 
It will also have to be agreed to by the EU's executive Commission and the European Council, which represents all member states of the union. 
EU visa exemptions cover short trips of up to three months and currently some 60 countries in the world benefit from the system from Argentina to Japan to Ukraine. 
It is mostly designed for business and tourism and does not cover the right to work in the EU. 
Parallel talks among EU states on letting Britons visit without visas following a no-deal Brexit were delayed last week, diplomatic sources said, after Spain raised objections over Gibraltar, a British territory to which Madrid lays claim.
The dispute between Madrid and London has already threatened to derail the whole Brexit negotiation process once, but a last-minute deal with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cleared the way in November for the 27 EU states' approval of their divorce package with Britain.

Now, however, Britain is struggling to ratify the deal, with a series of votes due late on Tuesday in the House of Commons to seek alternatives to May's troubled plan.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's toughest rival in Israel's April ballot, former military chief and political enigma Benny Gantz, will set out his goals on Tuesday in a marker of the center-left opposition's prospects.
Polls predict a Netanyahu reelection, with his right-wing Likud party taking around 30 of parliament's 120 seats, and Gantz's Resilience party coming a distant second with around 15.
That would line Gantz up to join a future Netanyahu-led coalition government - unless the ex-general tries to mobilize like-minded factions against the incumbent, now in his fourth term. 
Much depends on the ideology of Gantz's newly formed party. On this he has so far been silent. His campaign, meanwhile, has stoked his residual popularity from his term as top general with graphic ads claiming hundreds of enemy deaths in two Gaza wars. 
But mindful of Israeli moderates, Gantz's image-makers also cast him in a softer light, releasing a video in which the tall, taciturn 59-year-old says ""there is no shame in pursuing peace"".
At a launch party on Tuesday timed to coincide with the evening TV news, Gantz was due to deliver his first political speech, with voters watching for combustible policy points like Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014, or corruption allegations dogging Netanyahu.
Tamar Hermann, a scholar with the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute, predicted Gantz would try to stay ""very vague on certain topics: for instance 'yes to peace but Israel's security comes first'"".
For Netanyahu to be defeated, Hermann said, Gantz would have to bring together disparate center-left parties.
""Anything can happen, but at the moment the most likely outcome of the election would be a (Netanyahu-led) center-right government,"" she said.
Likud has sought to write Gantz off as a ""leftist"", casting him as an untested whimsy candidate and no match for Netanyahu, 69, who is also defense minister.
As the election approaches, and facing possible indictment, Netanyahu has highlighted his handling of national security, publicly acknowledging Israeli air strikes against Iranian targets in Syria.
Martin Dempsey, a retired U.S. army general whose tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff mirrored that of Gantz as Israeli armed forces chief between 2011 and 2015, told Reuters that he would bring ""an open mind to change"" and have the ""instincts to build a team to solve the most urgent challenges"".

""His silence would likely signal to me that he is carefully and deliberately thinking and learning, preparing to express his views with clarity and confidence, so that he knows who and what he wants to be and do when the political winds begin to blow with greater velocity,"" Dempsey said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Standing atop the stairs outside his university auditorium, 20-year-old activist Parit Chiwarak led a protest of hundreds of people calling for an end to Thailand's ruling military junta.
""The military is supposed to protect the country, not fight the people,"" he called out to students gathered this month at Thammasat, one of Thailand's most prestigious universities. 
""We want elections,"" they chanted, many of them waving fans emblazoned with hearts reading ""Love Democracy"".
Thailand is scheduled to hold its first election since the army seized power in a 2014 coup within two months.
The March 24 vote could be swayed by young people, many of them newly politicized and active in a way that has rarely been seen since state forces crushed student pro-democracy movements in the 1970s. Voters aged 18-35 now make up just over a quarter of the electorate of about 50 million.
Of those, seven million are eligible to vote for the first time.
While it is not clear which way youngsters will vote, many say they do not favor the junta and the military-backed parties that have been formed to contest the election.
Young Thais for years have been seen as politically apathetic. Many say they were turned off by years of paralyzing street protests by Thailand's two rival factions, the ""Red Shirt"" loyalists of exiled ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and establishment ""Yellow Shirt"" pro-military royalist groups. 
But nearly five years of direct military rule has led to a small, but determined movement of young people calling for change.
""Young people today are not like before. We're more politically engaged, and we're a large voter base,"" said Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal, a 22-year-old student activist. 
""This is an all-important election for us. It's more than a transition of politicians, but a testimony whether we accept dictatorship, a life-and-death moment for our future."" 
A December poll by King Prajadhipok's Institute found that 90 percent of young voters aged 18 to 24 surveyed said they would vote in the next election, a departure from conventional wisdom that Thai youth are apathetic where politics are concerned.
That compares to only 37.9 percent of Thais aged 15 to 25 who said they were ""quite interested or very interested"" in politics ahead of Thailand's last election in 2010 . 
""Young people are creating ripples and are more politically awakened,"" said Anusorn Unno, a lecturer at Thammasat University.
COURTING THE YOUTH VOTE
Most of the student activism has focused mainly on calling for elections, and has not translated into support for any party.
One new political party is making direct appeals to the youth vote part of its platform. The Future Forward party, led by the charismatic heir to an auto-parts manufacturing empire, promises a new kind of politics that weakens the military and moves beyond the red-vs.-yellow conflicts. 
""The young people grew up in a highly divisive society. They don't see this as the new normal; they seek a way out. They seek change,"" said party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who at 40 is at least a decade younger than other major parties' likely prime ministerial candidates, all in their 50s and 60s.
Future Forward, made up almost entirely of young progressives with zero experience in politics, touts left-wing policies including scrapping obligatory military conscription for young men and ending economic monopolies for wealthy families. 
Also making appeals to youth are two of the biggest established parties, roughly associated with the ""Red Shirt"" and ""Yellow Shirt"" rival camps that have taken to the streets in the past decade. 
For the Pheu Thai party, which has won every election since 2001 and is linked to the red shirts, there are rampant social media memes of its possible prime ministerial candidate, Chatchart Sittiphan. He is portrayed as The Hulk, among other pop culture references.
Another prominent Pheu Thai candidate, long-time politician Sudarat Keyuraphan, often takes her teenage daughter on her campaign tours. 
The rival Democrat party, whose opposition to Thaksin gained some support from the yellow shirt movement, also heavily promotes its ""New Dem"" wing of young politicians including the party leader's 26-year-old nephew, Parit Wacharasindhu, who promised to bring more youth agendas to government.
Even junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha has a few youthful fans - though they are harder to find.
""He's obviously not corrupt like previous governments,"" said Penumpai Phumxusri, 27, said of Prayut, a former general. 
RAP AGAINST DICTATORSHIP
In recent decades, youth activism in Thailand has been muted, haunted by the violent crackdown on student uprisings in the 1970s.
On October 6, 1976, state forces and royalist mobs attacked a group of about 2,000 students inside Thammasat University and killed dozens, accusing them of sympathizing with left-leaning revolutions sweeping through the region at the time.
Now, several youth activists have taken to calling the junta a ""dictatorship"". Small protests are held and satirical cartoons targeting the military have appeared on social media and as street art.
Last year, a music group called Rap Against Dictatorship released a song that notched up about 54 million views on YouTube, with lyrics calling Thailand ""a country where the parliament is the military's living room."" 
Social media-savvy youth also took their frustration to Twitter in January with a hashtag translated roughly as ""not another damn delay,"" when the junta said a Feb. 24 election date would be postponed again. 
""I have seen a lot of changes in the youths over the past year, like with the rap song and the hashtag, which indicate how much they value their rights and liberties,"" said Anusorn, the Thammasat lecturer. 

""When the polls roll around, the young and especially the new voters will turn up in high numbers.""

NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as scaling back or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbors. 
Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country's north amid environmental concerns.
Asked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar's investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents.
""Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,"" Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw.
Thaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option.
Myanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and ""was working hard to find the solution,"" he said.
Spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi's government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp.
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has previously said it would ""maintain communication"" with Myanmar over the project.
Finding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing's support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma.
Myanmar also needs Beijing's help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China.
Thaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not ""thought out"" and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment.
The dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election.
China's Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam's electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said.
""There's no need for this dam now,"" he said.

On Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 03:05AM ET</span>",Philippine bishops seek forgiveness for silence on concerns about Duterte,"MANILA (Reuters) - In a rare move, the largest group of Catholic bishops in the Philippines has sought forgiveness for its lengthy silence over ""disturbing issues"", such as the president's bloody war on drugs and his attacks on the church and its doctrines.
The church is highly influential and an important source of moral guidance in the Philippines, where about 80 percent of a population of 105 million are Roman Catholic. 
Although known for speaking out in times of crisis and to rebuff doctrinal challenges, the bishops' silence over President Rodrigo Duterte's lambasting of the church and God, as well as his bloody crackdown on drugs, have raised questions about their unity and commitment to values.
""Forgive us for the length of time that it took us to find our collective voice,"" the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) said in a pastoral letter, issued late on Monday.
""We too needed to be guided properly in prayer and discernment before we could guide you.""
In the letter headlined, ""Conquering Evil with Good"", the bishops admitted silence over ""disturbing issues about which you may have felt you urgently needed our spiritual and pastoral guidance"".
It was not immediately clear why the CBCP issued the letter, which followed a plenary assembly.
It opposed efforts led by Duterte's allies to lower the age of criminal liability for children, and said it had seen a ""culture of violence has gradually prevailed in our land,"" referring also to a deadly church bombing on Sunday.
The popular Duterte's tirades against the Catholic church are now famous. A self-confessed victim of sexual abuse by a priest, Duterte has called God ""stupid"", characterized as ""silly"" the doctrine of the Holy Trinity and accused bishops of concealing their homosexuality.
The bishops said they understood the need to fight crime and drugs, but were concerned ""when we started hearing of mostly poor people being brutally murdered on mere suspicion of being small-time drug users and peddlers,"" while bigger players were left alone.
Police say they have killed more than 5,000 people, all in self-defense, while trying to arrest drug dealers and deny that any were executions, as alleged by human rights groups.
Some bishops have taken individual stands against the crackdown, denouncing it in sermons, issuing pro-life statements and supporting marches and calls for church bells to be rung in protest, but these remained sporadic efforts within the church.
Asked about the letter, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said Duterte was serving and protecting the people.

""Rather than attack the president ... I'd rather they issue a statement that they are praying for the president to succeed in his endeavor,"" he said.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 03:00AM ET</span>",Myanmar Suu Kyi's party proposes ‘committee’ to change army-drafted charter,"By Shoon Naing and Poppy McPherson
NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar's ruling party on Tuesday proposed steps toward changing the constitution, its biggest challenge in nearly three years to the military's power over politics as enshrined in the charter.
The proposal could add to tension between the military and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which have been at loggerheads over the charter since the party's historic landslide election win in 2015.
The surprise bid to reform the constitution comes as both civilian and military leaders face growing international pressure over an army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in 2017 that sent about 730,000 people fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.
Addressing parliament on Tuesday, speaker T Khun Myat said NLD member of parliament Aung Kyi Nyunt had submitted an “emergency proposal” to form a parliamentary committee for amending the constitution.
The speaker turned down an objection by military lawmaker Brigadier-General Maung Maung that the proposal breached “procedure”.
Parliament will vote later on Tuesday on whether to discuss the proposal further, a motion requiring a simple majority.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi's NLD commands a large majority in the two houses of parliament.
But the 2008 constitution, drafted during military rule, guarantees the army a quarter of seats and changes to the charter require votes of more than 75 percent, giving the army an effective veto.
The constitution also blocks Suu Kyi from becoming president as it contains a prohibition on presidential candidates with foreign spouses or children. Suu Kyi had two sons with her late British academic husband.
For nearly three years, she has ruled from ""above the president"" by creating a new position of State Counsellor. 
The constitution also gives military control of key security ministries, including defense and home affairs.
LONG-HELD AIM
Suu Kyi has long spoken of her aim to reform the constitution as part of a democratic transition after 50 years of strict military rule.
""The amendment of the constitution was one of the goals of our government,"" she said during a forum in Singapore in August.
""The completion of our democratic transition must necessarily involve the completion of a truly democratic constitution.""
She was not in parliament on Tuesday.
The military has for decades seen itself as the only institution capable of preventing the disintegration of the ethnically diverse country, and has stressed the importance of its constitutional oversight of the political system.
An adviser to Suu Kyi who openly called for reforms to reduce the military’s role, Ko Ni, was shot dead in broad daylight at the Yangon International Airport exactly two years ago, on Jan. 29, 2017.
While no evidence has emerged that his call for constitutional reform led directly to his murder, or that active military officials ordered the killing, his death cast a pall over reform efforts.
It was not clear what provisions of the constitution the NLD's proposal would target or whether the party had secured the buy-in from the military necessary to pass any such measure.
In the past, some members of Suu Kyi's party have expressed their desire to amend Article 436, which gives the military the effective veto over constitutional reform.
At a short meeting with its MPs on Monday, the party's central executive panel briefed them on the plans for Tuesday's vote, said Ye Htut, who attended the gathering.

Party spokesman Myo Nyunt declined to comment. Reuters was unable to seek comment from the parliamentary office.

Recordings obtained by the paper dating from July 2018 appeared to feature audio of Kaczynski commenting on and cancelling the project. The paper cited unidentified sources.
""If we don't win the elections, we won't be able to build this tower in Warsaw,"" he says in the recordings, according to Wyborcza.
Beata Mazurek, a spokeswoman for Kaczynski's PiS party, said on Twitter on Monday: ""'Pseudo revelations' that are being discussed today on (Twitter) is just another story from (Gazeta Wyborcza) about the company Srebrna. The same gossip and speculation, that we've been hearing for years.""
Mazurek was not immediately available for comment when Reuters called on Tuesday.
Kaczynski oversaw the investment process for the building of the office project, which was meant to include apartments, a hotel and the base of the Lech Kaczynski foundation, named after Jaroslaw's twin brother and former president of Poland, Gazeta Wyborcza said. 
State-run bank Pekao was meant to help finance the investment preparations for up to 15.5 million euros and offer credit for around 300 million euros, the newspaper said. 

Kaczynski is accused of not paying Birgfellner for his services. Birgfellner's lawyers have notified the Warsaw prosecutor's office of a potential crime on Kaczynski's part, Wyborcza said.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>","No deal, no problem: Wetherspoon pubs boss raises a glass to Brexit","By Helena Williams (NYSE:WMB)
BLACKPOOL, England (Reuters) - Wetherspoon's boss Tim Martin says British business has nothing to fear from leaving the European Union without a deal, and to prove it he's ""Brexiting"" his pubs by swapping French champagne and cognac for English sparkling wine and Australian brandy. 
The 63-year-old entrepreneur has just completed a two-month tour of 100 of his pubs to campaign for a no-deal Brexit over a pint of beer - or a drink from one of their new suppliers.
In the northwest-England seaside resort of Blackpool, where 67.5 percent voted to leave the EU, about 50 locals turned out on a January afternoon at The Velvet Coaster, a three-floor ""superpub"" that opened in 2015, to hear him speak.
Martin was one of the few big business leaders who publicly backed Brexit during Britain's 2016 referendum on EU membership, and he is now in an even smaller group of those pushing for the country to leave the bloc without a withdrawal deal. 
""We can eliminate tariffs on thousands of products, many of which aren't made in the UK, like rice, bananas, oranges, New Zealand wine - 12,000 products, and that will make people in the country better off,"" he said in an interview at the bar.
Many of Britain's big companies shied away from the debate in 2016, fearful of alienating customers on the opposing side. 
Martin had no such qualms, and has continued to campaign on television, in the company's stock market reports and even on beer mats for a complete break with Brussels.
He said he was testing the validity of the scare stories about a no-deal Brexit, such as empty shelves caused by snarl-ups at ports, in his own pubs, which offer cut-price deals on drinks and meals.
""Wetherspoon had a European supply chain, we were buying French brandy, French champagne, spirits from Germany, and so on, and we've switched, because people said the ports might seize up, which I don't think they will,"" he said.
""We've got equal or better products at lower prices from outside the EU.""
Retailers such as Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and McDonald's warned on Monday of major short-term disruption if there were no Brexit deal, adding it would be impossible to stockpile fresh food. They also said setting import tariffs at zero would devastate Britain's farmers.
Martin, however, said companies needed to ""raise their eyes above the horizon"", noting that 93 percent of the world's population was outside the EU.
He said beyond changing suppliers, Wetherspoon, which has more than 900 pubs, did not have to do anything to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. 
""No one's said we need to do anything and I don't think we do,"" he said after posing for selfies with customers. ""We're just pulling pints and making fish and chips as usual.""
Retiree Jean Greaves, aged 76, who voted leave in 2016, said in the pub that Britain might have a rough few weeks after Brexit day on March 29, but ""then I think we'll start bouncing back, I truly do"".
On a nearby street, Jonathan Brown, aged 64, who was in the minority that voted to remain in the EU, said he had no time for those who said no-deal would be good for business. 

""I think they're deluded, absolutely deluded,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Tuesday sentenced the founder of a website that reported on human rights abuses to five years in jail for ""inciting subversion"" of state power, a verdict decried by a rights group as part of a campaign to bury grassroots activism.
Since coming to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping drive to stifle activism that challenges the ruling Communist Party. 
Liu Feiyue, the founder of msguancha.com, a news portal that covers government corruption, police abuses and human rights issues, was arrested in late 2016 and charged with ""inciting subversion of state power"".
The Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liu to five years in prison and seized more than one million yuan ($148,326) of his personal assets, according to the website of the court in Suizhou city in Hubei province. 
It was not possible to contact Liu for comment.
""I really can't understand it. All I know is that Liu Feiyue just set up a website for internet users to write about social issues and inequality,"" Liu's mother Ding Qihua, 76, told Reuters by phone.
She said the sentence was harsher than expected, given that the family had hoped for leniency by complying fully with the court's requests.
There was no response when Reuters called the Suizhou court on Tuesday.
China rejects criticism of its human rights record, saying it is a country with rule of law and that jailed rights lawyers and activists are criminals who have broken the law.
Hundreds of rights lawyers have been detained and dozens jailed in a series of arrests commonly known as ""709"" cases, referring to July 9, 2015 when a countrywide operation rounded up core members of the group.
On Monday, in the last of the ""709"" cases to go to trial, a court jailed rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang for 4-1/2 years on charges of subversion.
Aside from targeting lawyers, Beijing has also in recent years clamped down on grassroots activism and muckracking websites, in what rights groups say is an attempt to cut off rights activism at its roots.
""Prosecuting the editor of a human rights website shows just how frightened the Chinese government is about independent reporting on abuses from inside China,"" Yaqiu Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

The group said its latest report on business leaders' perceptions of corruption put the United States at 71, down from 75, on a scale of 0-100.
That sounds a ""wake-up call"" about the need to tackle conflicts of interest, undue influence of the private sector and widening gaps between rich and poor, said Zoe Reiter, the watchdog's acting representative to the United States.
""This is a red flag because it's really part of a pattern that we've seen since the 2008 global financial crisis of a loss of trust ... in our public institutions,"" she told Reuters.

Concerns were already mounting before the election of Donald Trump, although they have been highlighted by the actions of a rich president who defied precedent to keep his personal tax affairs secret and retain his business holdings in office.
""Concerns around the Trump administration are quite serious, but this has been stewing for several years,"" she said. ""Conflict of interest wasn't a new problem, but it was illuminated in its glory when you have someone who is basically breaking norms.""
""Trump is a symptom not a cause. His presidency is illuminating some of the problems.""
Denmark and New Zealand had the best scores on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) again in 2018, scoring 88 and 87, while Somalia, Syria and South Sudan remained at the bottom, with scores of 10, 13 and 13, TI said.
Overall, more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50 on the 2018 index, and the average was 43, said TI, which has more than 100 chapters worldwide. 
The group said only 20 countries had significantly improved their scores since 2012, including Argentina and Ivory Coast. Sixteen others, including Australia, Chile and Malta, declined significantly in the same period.
The average score for EU and western European countries held steady at 66, while sub-Saharan Africa scored just 32, TI said. A score of 100 is considered ""very clean"", while a score of zero is highly corrupt.
TI said its analysis showed a clear link between having a healthy democracy and fighting public sector corruption, and cited declining scores for Turkey and Hungary, in connection with challenges to the rule of law and press freedoms.
Hungary's score dropped by eight points to 46 over the past five years, amid troubling developments including the forced departure of the Open Society Foundation and Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros, TI said.
Turkey's score dropped by nine points in the same period to a score of 41, as the country was downgraded to 'not free' on a democracy ranking, TI said.

""Corruption is much more likely to flourish where democratic foundations are weak and ... where undemocratic and populist politicians can use it to their advantage,"" said Delia Ferreira Rubio, who chairs the global civil society group.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious five-year plan to clamp down on corruption in government, months after a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal brought down the previous administration.
The plan, launched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, would involve sweeping changes to the appointment process for key posts, require lawmakers and ministers to publicly declare their assets, and introduce new laws to regulate political funding and lobbying. 
Voters rejected Mahathir's predecessor Najib Razak in an election in May last year, amid widespread public disgust over allegations that about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund set up by Najib. 
The former premier, his wife, and several high-ranking officials of his former administration have since been hit with dozens of criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other government entities. All of them have pled not guilty. 
Mahathir said Malaysia needs ""all kinds of strategies, laws and restrictions"" to curb corruption. 
""This plan is a strong statement from the current government that we will track down and prosecute past offenders, while current and future offenders will be facing harsher action,"" Mahathir said in a speech to launch the new approach to fighting graft.
The plan's measures would target the government's procurement process, law enforcement, judiciary, politics and business, he said.
New rules on political funding could affect opposition parties, particularly the United Malays National Organisation, the party once led by Mahathir and subsequently led by Najib for close to a decade before his fall last year.
Having led every multi-ethnic coalition since independence six decades ago until its defeat in 2018, UMNO had established a system of patronage to bind Malay support for the party.
UMNO and PAS, an Malay Islamist party also in opposition, had reportedly received funds from 1MDB. 
Malaysia was ranked 62 out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International last year.
1MDB A CASE STUDY 
Malaysian and U.S. authorities allege that Jho Low, a financier with ties to Najib's family, diverted funds from 1MDB and that about $1 billion of it made their way into Najib's personal bank accounts. 
Both Najib and Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, have consistently denied wrongdoing.
Officials studied the 1MDB case closely to design the new anti-corruption plan, said Abu Kassim Mohamed, the director-general of the Governance, Integrity and Anti-Corruption Centre, which drafted the anti-graft measures. 
""When you have a top leader of the country allegedly involved in misconduct on such a mega scale, that has an impact on the public,"" Abu Kassim told Reuters on Monday.
The plan addresses high-risk practices such as the selling of government contracts to third parties, and the appointment of political operatives to the board of state-linked companies, he said. 

It also aims to strengthen the independence of investigating bodies such as the audit department and the anti-corruption commission, he said.

The group said 55 percent of respondents to its 2018 reporting conditions survey said they believed conditions deteriorated last year, the largest proportion since 2011.
""Not a single correspondent said conditions improved last year,"" the group said, unveiling results of a survey of its 204 foreign correspondent members, 109 of whom responded to questions.
""Rapidly expanding surveillance and widespread government interference against reporting in the country's far northwestern region of Xinjiang drove a significant deterioration in the work environment for foreign journalists in China in 2018.""
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.
The government has repeatedly said it is committed to ensuring foreign media can report easily in China, but that they must follow Chinese rules and regulations.
According to rules issued just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China allows foreign reporters to interview anyone as long as they have permission.
But the government often interprets the rules to suit its needs, rights groups say, especially when it comes to sensitive subjects. Tibet remains off limits for foreign journalists apart from government-organized visits.
While foreign journalists are occasionally harassed or temporarily detained in China, domestic media operate under strict government controls. Chinese reporters have been fired or jailed for writing stories that stray too far from the government line.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent since assuming office six years ago and his administration has tightened Communist Party controls on all levels of society, including in Xinjiang.

A letter sent to the Asahi newspaper's Tokyo headquarters on Friday threatened to distribute drugs laced with potassium cyanide, a highly toxic substance, unless 35 million South Korean won ($31,000) was paid in Bitcoin, the newspaper said. It did not say whom the money should be paid to.
Similar envelopes were delivered last week to the Mainichi newspaper's Tokyo offices, pharmaceutical companies in Tokyo and Osaka and a food company in the northern city of Sapporo, local media including national broadcaster NHK said.
According to NHK, police identified some of the powder as potassium cyanide.

KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and the Taliban have sketched the outlines for an eventual peace accord to end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, a U.S. special envoy said on Monday, but there was no sign the insurgent group had accepted key U.S. demands.
""We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,"" U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told the New York Times in an interview in Kabul after six days of talks with the Taliban. 
""The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.""
There was no sign, however, that the Taliban had agreed to U.S. demands such as committing to a ceasefire before the withdrawal of U.S. troops or that it engage in direct talks with the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, analysts said.
""While the progress in Doha has been the most significant to date, reaching a final agreement is far from guaranteed, as (these) two major sticking points could still derail the process,"" Ahmad Majidyar, a fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote on the Washington think tank's website.
Another U.S. official in Kabul, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, described ""significant progress"" in the talks in Qatar, but said more negotiations were needed on the issue of the timing of the ceasefire, which looms as a sticking point in the next round of talks on Feb. 25.
Taliban negotiators want a full withdrawal before a ceasefire, but the Americans want the reverse, the official said.
""Of course we don't seek a permanent military presence in Afghanistan,"" the official said.
""Our goal is to help bring peace in Afghanistan and we would like a future partnership, newly defined with a post-peace government,"" the official said. ""We would like to leave a good legacy.""
U.S. forces in 2001 toppled the country's hardline Islamic leaders for harboring the al Qaeda militants responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks that killed about 3,000 people.
A senior Trump administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the Taliban would have to agree to talk to the government in Kabul to make a lasting deal. 
""The president has made clear that his priority is ending the war in Afghanistan with an agreement that ensures the country never again serves as a base for terrorists to attack the U.S. or any other country,"" the official said. 
""To achieve such an agreement, the Taliban must engage with other Afghans and all sides must agree to resolve their differences through peaceful means,"" he added.
Taliban officials have repeatedly refused to talk to the Afghan government, which they regard as a U.S. puppet, throwing into question how effective a peace deal could be. The Taliban do want, however, to join an interim government post-deal.
NO PLANS YET
A State Department spokesman said that while the talks were ""positive,"" no agreement was reached and ""a number of issues remain on the table ... including an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive ceasefire.""
""These are integral to a negotiated political settlement,"" said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters outside the Pentagon he had been briefed on the talks but had not been asked to plan for a full withdrawal of troops. 
""It's encouraging,"" Shanahan said of the talks. Asked whether he had been tasked with planning a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, he said: ""I have not.""
Despite the presence of U.S.-led foreign forces training, advising and assisting their Afghan counterparts, the Taliban control nearly half of Afghanistan and stage near-daily attacks against the government and its security forces.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said last week that 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he took office in 2014.
A U.S. official said in December that President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the latest sign of his thinning patience with America's longest war and overseas military interventions. Trump last month decided to pull U.S. troops out of Syria as well.
Both U.S. officials and the Taliban hailed progress after the talks with Khalilzad ended on Saturday. Taliban sources told Reuters that the United States had agreed to withdraw foreign troops within 18 months of the signing of a pact, but the U.S. official said a timeline was not discussed.
The U.S. troops in Afghanistan are part of a NATO-led mission and a U.S. counterterrorism mission largely directed at groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.

Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries are participating in the operation, known as Resolute Support.

Governor J.B. Pritzker said wind chill could drive temperatures to -55 degrees Fahrenheit in northern Illinois on Tuesday evening, capable of causing frostbite in a matter of minutes.
""This is a potentially historic winter storm that will bring extreme cold to our state and all Illinoisans must prepare,"" Pritzker said in a written statement released by his office.""Our administration is putting into place an Emergency Preparedness Plan with key state agencies as well as warning residents about these life-threatening conditions.""
The so-called polar vortex weather system was expected to send frigid winds that circulate around the North Pole across much of the United States from the Dakotas through New England, National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said.
""If you live up in the Arctic Circle, you'd say this is pretty normal. When it's actually brought down to this level, that's when you know it's something serious,"" Hurley said.
Blizzard conditions were predicted across parts of the western Ohio Valley and snow was expected through Wednesday from the Great Lakes region into New England.
Snowfall was also expected in the Dakotas, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; and in Central Michigan, where a foot (30 cm) or more of snow is expected, the weather service said. 
Chicago will take the main brunt of the super cold weather, with widespread heavy snow already affecting the area on Monday, the weather service said on Twitter. Wind chills as low as -50 F (-46C) were also expected by Tuesday evening through Thursday morning. 
The service's Des Moines, Iowa, branch said ""dangerous, life-threatening cold air"" will hit the Midwestern state from Tuesday morning through Friday morning, with wind chill values on Wednesday likely to range from minus 45 Fahrenheit (minus 43 C) to minus 55 Fahrenheit (minus 48 C) across the northern part of the state.
Nearly 2,300 U.S. flights had been canceled and another 11,800 delayed as of Monday evening, many attributed to the storm. 

Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said it would waive flight change fees for passengers affected by the winter weather in Chicago, Detroit and areas of the Upper Midwest.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil's government weighed pushing for a management overhaul at iron ore miner Vale SA on Monday as grief over the hundreds feared killed by a dam burst turned into anger, with prosecutors, politicians and victims' families calling for punishment.
By Monday night, firefighters in the state of Minas Gerais had confirmed that 65 people were killed by Friday's disaster, when a burst tailings dam sent a torrent of sludge into the miner's offices and the town of Brumadinho.
There were still 279 people unaccounted for, and officials said it was unlikely that any would be found alive.
Brazil's acting president, Hamilton Mourao, told reporters a government task force on the disaster response is looking at whether it could or should change Vale's top management.
Public-sector pension funds hold several seats on the board of the mining company, and the government holds a ""golden share"" giving it power over strategic decisions.
""The question of Vale's management is being studied by the crisis group,"" said Mourao, who is serving as acting president for some 48 hours while President Jair Bolsonaro recovers from surgery. ""I'm not sure if the group could make that recommendation.""
Shares of Vale, the world's largest iron ore and nickel producer, plummeted 24.5 percent on Monday in Sao Paulo, erasing nearly $19 billion in market capitalization. A U.S. law firm filed a shareholder class action lawsuit against the company in New York, seeking to recover investment losses.
Igor Lima, a fund manager at Galt Capital in Rio, said the severe threats from the government and prosecutors drove the shares even lower than many analysts had estimated.
""This reaction has brought quite a lot of uncertainty about the size of the financial punishment Vale will have to handle"", he said.
Senator Renan Calheiros, who is in the thick of a Senate leadership race, on Twitter called for Vale's top management to be removed urgently ""out of respect for the victims ... and to avoid any destruction of evidence."" 
One of Vale's lawyers, Sergio Bermudes, told newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that management should not leave the company and said that Calheiros was trying to profit politically from the tragedy.
Vale's senior executives have apologized for the disaster but have not accepted responsibility, saying the installations met the highest industry standards.
Brazil's top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be held strongly responsible and criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said.
REPEATED FAILURES
The disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine occurred less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB), killing 19 and dumping toxic sludge in a major river. 
While the 2015 Samarco disaster unleashed about five times more mining waste, Friday's dam break was far deadlier as the wall of mud hit Vale's local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill.
""The cafeteria was in a risky area,"" Renato Simao de Oliveiras, 32, said while searching for his twin brother, a Vale employee, at an emergency response station. ""Just to save money, even if it meant losing the little guy. ... These businessmen, they only think about themselves.""
As search efforts continued on Monday, firefighters laid down wood planks to cross a sea of sludge that is hundreds of meters wide in places, to reach a bus in search of bodies inside. Villagers discovered the bus as they tried to rescue a nearby cow stuck in the mud.
Longtime resident Ademir Rogerio cried as he surveyed the mud where Vale's facilities once stood on the edge of town.
""The world is over for us,"" he said. ""Vale is the top mining company in the world. If this could happen here, imagine what would happen if it were a smaller miner."" 
Nestor José de Mury said he lost his nephew and coworkers in the mud. ""I've never seen anything like it, it killed everyone,"" he said.
Vale Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani told journalists on Monday evening that, despite interrupting operations in Brumadinho, the company would continue royalty payments to the municipality. He said Vale royalties made up about 60 percent of the town's 140 million reais in revenue last year.
Siani said a donation of 100,000 reais will be made to each family that lost a relative in the disaster and said Vale would step up investments in dam safety.
SAFETY DEBATE
The board of Vale, which has raised its dividends over the last year, suspended all shareholder payouts and executive bonuses late on Sunday, as the disaster put its corporate strategy under scrutiny.
Since the disaster, courts have order a freeze on 11.8 billion reais of Vale's assets to cover damages. State and federal authorities have slapped it with 349 million reais of administrative fines.
German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE may have to cover some of the costs of the dam collapse, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman said in a TV interview. ""We are 100 percent within all the standards, and that didn't do it.""
Many wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards.
""There are safe ways of mining,"" said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. ""It's just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way – and put lives at risk.""
Reaction to the disaster could threaten the plans of Brazil's newly inaugurated president to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swaths of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle for mining.
Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said in a TV interview on Monday that Brazil should create new regulation for mining dams, replacing wet tailings dams with dry mining methods. 
Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque proposed in a Sunday newspaper interview that the law be changed to assign responsibility in cases such as Brumadinho to the people responsible for certifying the safety of mining dams. 

""Current law does not prevent disasters like the one we saw on Brumadinho,"" he said. ""The model for verifying the state of mining dams will have to be reconsidered. The model isn't good.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico could soon face a shortage of staple foods such as corn flour and wheat flour as railways remain blocked after two weeks of teacher protests in the western state of Michoacan, railroad operator Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex) said on Monday. 
Teachers from the National Committee of Education Workers union began blocking the railroad tracks on Jan. 14 to protest labor demands. That has hampered the distribution of supplies for various industries, including hydrocarbons and grains such as corn, a staple of the Mexican diet, Ferromex spokeswoman Lourdes Aranda said. 
""There may be a shortage of wheat flour and corn flour in the coming days, meaning that prices for something that is consumed on a daily basis, such as bread and tortillas, may be affected,"" she told local television station Televisa.
""There is already serious shortage in many other industries, such as steel making and the automotive industry ... because they no longer have the necessary inputs to continue operating,"" Aranda added.
A total of 252 trains have been unable to transport 2.1 million tonnes of products, with about 10,500 containers stranded in the ports of Manzanillo in Colima state and Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan, according to railway and shipping industry associations.
The data includes figures from Ferromex, which is part of the transportation division of mining giant Grupo Mexico, and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).

Economic losses from the blockade amount to 14 billion Mexican pesos ($736 million), according to the Mexican Confederation of Industrial Chambers.

Kamto has been mobilizing dissent against President Paul Biya since losing what he says was a fraudulent election in October. Kamto declared himself winner at the time of the poll and has since challenged Biya's win in the African Union court.
Protests are rare in Cameroon, outside its troubled Anglophone western region, and tend to be swiftly put down by force and mass arrests.
""I can confirm that professor Maurice Kamto was arrested (today),"" his lawyer, Agbor Bala, told Reuters by telephone, adding that it was because of the weekend protests in which dozens took part. The treasurer of his Cameroon Renaissance Movement party, Alain Fogue, was also detained, Bala said. 
At 85, Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa and most Cameroonians have known only him as president. He holds Cabinet meetings only every few years and spends a lot of his time on private trips to Switzerland. But the opposition has been unable to mount a credible challenge to him. 
The election cemented his place as one of Africa's longest- serving leaders, but allegations of ballot stuffing and intimidation loomed over his victory, and turnout was low because of a secessionist uprising in the Anglophone regions in which hundreds have died. 

Biya's camp has denied all allegations of electoral fraud.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman said in court on Monday that he will not testify in his own defense at his U.S. trial.
Guzman announced his decision after prosecutors rested their case against him in federal court in Brooklyn. After excusing the jury, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan asked Guzman directly whether he understood it was his decision, not that of his lawyers, to testify or not.
""Yes, but they counseled me about it and I agree with them,"" Guzman answered.
Had Guzman, 61, testified, it would have provided a fitting climax to an already dramatic trial. However, Guzman's decision was widely expected, as testifying would have exposed him to cross-examination by prosecutors.
Guzman was extradited to the United States in January 2017 to face charges that he trafficked massive quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs into the United States as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. 
Prosecutors have put more than 50 witnesses on the stand since the trial began in November, many of them former Guzman associates who have pleaded guilty to U.S. charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Their testimony has offered an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the Mexican drug trade.
Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman's lawyers, said in his opening argument in November that his client was framed by the cartel's true leader, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, with the help of corrupt government officials.
Lichtman said on Monday he planned to call two U.S. law enforcement agents, whom he did not name, as defense witnesses on Tuesday morning. Lichtman had said in a court filing on Saturday that he wanted to call the agents to rebut testimony by two of the prosecution's witnesses about their earlier statements to law enforcement.
Judge Cogan said prosecutors should expect to begin their closing argument on Wednesday morning.
The trial has also featured accusations of corruption against Mexican government officials, the most explosive of which was that former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took a $100 million bribe from Guzman. A spokesman for Pena Nieto has denied the allegation.
Alejandro Edda, the Mexican actor who plays Guzman in the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) television drama ""Narcos,"" made a surprise appearance in the courtroom gallery Monday. Guzman grinned broadly at Edda after his lawyers told him who he was.

Edda later told reporters outside the courthouse that the smile ""shook"" him.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Support for Australia's conservative government edged higher over the last two weeks, a widely watched poll showed on Tuesday, boosting Prime Minister Scott Morrison's reelection prospects less than four months out from the next election.
The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed the Liberal-National coalition government trails the main opposition Labor party by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent on a two-party preferred basis under Australia's preferential voting system, where votes from minor parties are redistributed.
While still on course for an election defeat, the Newspoll is the best result for Morrison's government since the ousting of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in August 2018.
The removal of Turnbull, which ushered in Morrison as the sixth different prime minister in the last decade, saw voters abandon the government amid widespread anger at the ousting of the popular liberal lawmaker.
Morrison's government was quickly plunged into minority form after voters selected an independent to replace Turnbull, who quit politics shortly after his removal.
Morrison must return to the polls by May 2019, an election that is poised to be fought over inequality.
Morrison's government, which late last year delivered its strongest fiscal outlook in 10 years, is expected to promise tax cuts and sweeteners in the final budget in April.
Labor has pledged to cut capital gains tax discounts and scrap a favorable tax scheme for owners of multiple properties, known as negative gearing, amid soaring house prices.

SACRAMENTO, Calif./NEW YORK (Reuters) - The deadliest and most destructive California wildfires in a century caused insurers more than $11.4 billion in losses, the state's insurance regulator said Monday.
The total amount of insured losses for the November Camp Fire, which destroyed most of the town of Paradise in northern California, jumped 25 percent since December, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara told reporters during a media event.
More than 13,000 insured homes and businesses were destroyed out of more than 46,000 claims reported by insurers.
The figures are ""unprecedented,"" Lara said. ""These are massive numbers for us."" Lara said.
The November wildfires, combined with other blazes in the state drove total 2018 insured losses to $12.4 billion.

A total of 89 people died in the Camp Fire and thousands were left homeless.

""We will not allow the continued presence of an international force that acts against us,"" Netanyahu said in a statement announcing that the Temporary International Presence in Hebron's (TIPH) mandate would not be renewed.
The statement did not elaborate on the alleged misconduct of TIPH, which draws staff from Norway, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The TIPH website says the force works on six-month mandates but did not specify when the current one expires. 
A force spokesman declined comment. Palestinians denounced the move.
""The Israeli government's decision means it has abandoned the implementation of agreements signed under international auspices, and given up its obligations under these agreements,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose peace talks with Netanyahu stalled in 2014.
Conservative Israeli commentators had accused the TIPH of agitating against Jewish settlers who live under heavy Israeli army protection in Hebron, a biblical city with an overwhelmingly Palestinian populace. 
The TIPH was set up after a settler killed 29 Palestinians at a Hebron shrine holy to both Muslims and Jews in 1994. 
Since Israel partially withdrew from Hebron in 1998 under interim peace deals with the self-rule Palestinian Authority, the TIPH has ""observe(d) and report(ed) on breaches of the agreements (and) violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law,"" the force's website says.
Most world powers consider Israel's settlements in the West Bank, where Palestinians want a state, to be illegal. Israel disputes this, and the rightist Netanyahu has played up his pro-settler credentials as he seeks reelection in an April 9 ballot.
""They want to uproot us from here. They will not,"" he said in separate remarks on Monday at another West Bank settlement.

""There's a line of thought that says that the way to achieve peace with the Arabs is to be extirpated from our land. That is the certain path to achieving the opposite of this dream.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed president, on Monday called for new street demonstrations as pressure intensified on President Nicolas Maduro and the crisis-stricken OPEC nation. 
Countries around the world have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader, and the United States vowed to starve Maduro's administration of oil revenue after he was sworn in Jan. 10 for a second term that was widely dubbed illegitimate. 
Maduro says the United States is promoting a coup against him and promised to stay in office, backed by Russia and China, which have bankrolled his government and fought off efforts to have his government disavowed by the United Nations. 
Guaido said opposition sympathizers should take to the streets on Wednesday to pass out copies of a pamphlet proposing amnesty that would give some legal protection to members of the military in hopes they will turn against Maduro.
""We must remain united as active agents of change in every corner of the country,"" Guaido tweeted on Monday. ""We're doing well, very well, Venezuela!""
On Sunday, Israel and Australia joined countries backing the 35-year-old Guaido, and U.S. President Donald Trump said his government had accepted Venezuelan opposition figure Carlos Alfredo Vecchio as a diplomatic representative to the United States.
Guaido took advantage of a major street demonstration on Jan. 23 to swear himself in as the country's rightful leader, accusing Maduro of usurping power following a disputed 2018 re-election that countries around the world described as a fraud. 
Guaido is asking for help in getting control of the Venezuelan government's offshore assets. 
In recent days, he urged British Prime Minister Theresa May and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to block Maduro's government from collecting more than $1 billion in gold held by the Bank of England.
Venezuela's once-buoyant socialist economic system has imploded from corruption and mismanagement since the collapse of world oil prices in 2014, pushing inflation to almost 2 million percent and driving millions of Venezuelans to neighboring countries.

Maduro says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by his political adversaries with the help of Washington, which has levied several rounds of sanctions against the country since 2017.

McCallum had not accurately conveyed the government's thinking on the situation, Freeland told reporters in Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday he had fired McCallum.
McCallum embarrassed Trudeau's Liberal government by saying last week that Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States. McCallum later said he ""misspoke."" 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Her arrest enraged China, which has called for the extradition case to be dropped. 
China's foreign ministry said earlier on Monday that Trudeau's dismissal of the ambassador was an internal Canadian affair and China would not comment.
At a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China's call for Canada to ""make the correct choice"" and release Meng so she could return to China. She was granted bail 10 days after her arrest.
The United States has until Wednesday to formally request her extradition over the alleged Iran sanctions violations.

Iran will also help repair power stations across Syria and set up a new plant in the coastal province of Latakia, he added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has a message for Prime Minister Theresa May as she plots a path out of the Brexit impasse: Britain needs to decide what it really wants but the negotiated divorce deal will not be reopened.
With less than nine weeks until Britain is due by law to leave the European Union on March 29, there is no agreement yet in London on how and even whether to leave the world's biggest trading bloc.
Parliament defeated May's deal two weeks ago by a huge margin, with many Brexit-supporting rebels in her Conservative Party angry at the Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland if no other solutions can be agreed.
Ahead of Tuesday's votes in the British parliament on a way forward, lawmakers in May's party are pushing for her to demand the European Union drop the backstop and replace it with something else.
""It is quite a challenge to see how you can construct from a diversity of the opposition a positive majority for the deal,"" EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand told a Brussels conference organized by the European Policy Centre think-tank.
In a note of criticism of May's strategy, she said there appeared to be a lack of ""ownership"" in Britain of the agreement struck between the two sides in November, and that there was insufficient transparency in the prime minister's moves.
""There will be no more negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement,"" said Weyand, a German senior civil servant at the European Commission, reiterating the EU stance.
As the Brexit crisis goes down to the line, however, EU officials indicated there might be wriggle room if May came back with a clear, and viable, request for changes that she - and the EU - believe will secure a final ratification.
WRIGGLE ROOM?
However, Weyand echoed her boss Michel Barnier in saying that Britain could resolve some of the problems caused by opposition to the Irish backstop by changing some of its demands on post-Brexit trade.
Referring to an amendment to May's proposed next steps on Brexit put forward by senior Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady, who wants ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop, Weyand said that the withdrawal treaty already contained that possibility.
""We are open to alternative arrangements"" on the Irish border, she said. ""The problem with the Brady amendment is that it does not spell out what they are.
""The backstop is not a prerequisite for the future relationship,"" she said. ""We are open to alternative proposals.""
A source in May's office said the government would tell Conservative lawmakers to vote in favor of Brady's amendment if it is selected by the speaker on Tuesday.
Britain remaining in a customs union, or even the EU single market, could help reach a final agreement, Weyand said, adding: ""We need decisions on the UK side on the direction of travel.""
Weyand said the ratification of the EU-UK deal would build the trust necessary to build a new relationship, but ruled out bowing to British calls to set a time limit to the backstop beyond which the insurance policy would lapse.
""A time-limit on the backstop defeats the purpose of the backstop because it means that once the backstop expires you stand there with no solution for this border,"" Weyand said.
IMPASSE
Speaking to the same conference, a former British envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, said he expected the deadlock to persist in the coming weeks, saying it had always seemed likely that the outcome would remain in doubt until much closer to March 29.
Rogers was speaking in a personal capacity, having resigned two years ago after differences with May over the negotiation.
The question for May is whether the EU can offer enough to get a variant of her defeated deal through parliament.
May wants to use a series of votes on Tuesday to find a consensus that lawmakers in her own party could support, just two weeks since her deal suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in modern British history.
Parliament will vote on proposals made by lawmakers including a delay to Brexit and going back to the EU to demand changes to the Northern Irish backstop.

In essence, May is forcing lawmakers to show their cards on what sort of Brexit, if any, they want. Lawmakers in her own party want her to demand a last-minute change to the withdrawal deal to remove the backstop, which they fear could end up trapping the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under pressure to deliver on pre-election promises to revive an economy wrecked during the tenure of his predecessor Robert Mugabe, who ruled for 37 years before being forced to resign after a coup in 2017.
Mnangagwa's government has also come under severe criticism for a crackdown on violent protests over a fuel price hike that rights groups say killed at least 12 people and injured scores. Police say only three people died.
The Apex Council, which groups 16 civil service unions, said government negotiators did not bring a new offer at a meeting on Monday. More talks are set for Wednesday, Apex Council secretary David Dzatsungwa told reporters after a four-hour meeting.
""The Apex council gives the government up to the meeting of Wednesday 30 January 2019 or face inevitable job action,"" said Dzatsunga.
Unions want to be paid in dollars or have the monthly salary of the lowest paid worker increased from $414 to $1,700. There are 305,000 civil servants, including security forces. 
With inflation at 42 percent, its highest since 2008, and a shortage of cash in circulation eroding ordinary Zimbabweans' spending power, the fragile state of the economy is at the heart of the country's political troubles.
Mnangagwa promised during campaigning for the July 2018 presidential vote, which he won amid charges of fraud from the opposition, to repair the economy and break with Mugabe's politics.
But security forces dispersed demonstrations by force and cracked down on activists, leading to fears that Mnangagwa's government is reverting to Mugabe-era strong-arm politics.
Several opposition officials and activists have gone into hiding and police said on Monday they wanted to question at least 27 of them over the Jan. 14-16 strike that turned into violent street protests.

On Monday, Mnangagwa said he had told authorities to arrest security forces filmed by Sky News assaulting a man in handcuffs. Last week he promised action on security forces who committed violence during the crackdown.

media reported.
The comments by Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, followed an Israeli attack on Iranian targets in Syria last week - the latest in a series of assaults targeting Tehran's presence there in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s government. 
""We announce that if Israel takes any action to wage a war against us, it will definitely lead to its own elimination and the freeing of occupied (Palestinian) territories,"" Salami said, quoted by state television.
Iranian officials have previously said Tehran, which does not recognize Israel, would respond swiftly to any Israeli attack.
Israel backed U.S. President Donald Trump's move to back out of the 2015 international deal on Iran's nuclear program and welcomed Washington's reimposition of sanctions on the country.
Israel sees Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs as a threat to its existence. Iran says its nuclear work is for peaceful purposes only.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations envoy for Yemen on Monday urged the warring parties to withdraw their troops from the port of Hodeidah quickly, and international aid agencies said that conditions for thousands of starving people were deteriorating fast.
Envoy Martin Griffiths acknowledged that proposed timelines on a pull-out from the port, the main entry point for Yemen's commercial and aid imports, had slipped while the country stood on the brink of famine. 
""The initial timelines were rather ambitious,"" he said in comments posted on Twitter. ""We are dealing with a complex situation on the ground."" 
The aid agencies, meeting in London, said people were struggling to feed their children in what had become the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
But, said Isabelle Moussard Carlsen of Action Against Hunger, more aid was not the only solution to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people.
""I think we need to be very clear that we need a political solution to this conflict,"" she said.
Agreements reached in December between the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi were the first significant breakthrough in four years of conflict which has killed tens of thousands of people through military actions or other causes.
But little further progress has been made, risking the unraveling of the peace efforts.
The Houthis control Hodeidah and troops of a Saudi-led coalition are massed on its outskirts. The warring sides disagree over who should control the city and port after forces withdraw.
The truce in Hodeidah has largely been respected since coming into force a month ago, but skirmishes continue. Troops have not yet pulled out, missing a Jan. 7 target, and residents and aid workers have told Reuters that barricades, trenches and roadblocks have been reinforced.
Although fighting has escalated in other parts of Yemen, U.N. envoy Griffiths said he remained optimistic. 
""More than any time in the past, there is a political will demonstrated by all parties to put an end to this conflict,"" he said. ""What we need to see now is the implementation of the provisions of the agreement, fully and rapidly.""
PRISON WITHOUT WALLS
The war has been stalemated for years, with the Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Houthi movement that controls the capital Sanaa and most urban centers.
The coalition has twice attempted to capture Hodeidah port since last year to force the Houthis to negotiate, but held off from a full-blown assault amid fears that a disruption to supply lines would trigger mass starvation.
At the London meeting, 14 aid agencies called for action on the humanitarian crisis.
""It is what I like to call a prison without walls for the people living in the country at the moment. It is a difficult situation where people are struggling to buy their daily rations to be able to feed their children,"" Yemeni Oxfam campaign manager Awssan Kamal told Reuters.
Kimberley Brown of the British Red Cross said 85,000 children had lost their lives and malnutrition was taking a huge toll.
""I know from my colleagues that the situation is absolutely deteriorating at the moment,"" she said.
The coalition intervened in 2015 in Yemen to restore Hadi's government, which was ousted from power by the Houthis in late 2014. The group says its revolution is against corruption.
Western nations, some of which supply the coalition with arms and intelligence, are pressing for an end to the conflict that is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

ABUJA (Reuters) - A legal case against Nigeria's top judge which raised fears of interference in next month's presidential election was adjourned indefinitely on Monday, days after President Muhammadu Buhari suspended the chief justice.
The European Union and the United States voiced concerns after Buhari suspended Walter Onnoghen from the position where he would have a key say in resolving any disputes after the Feb. 16 election. 
""This case has been adjourned sine die (indefinitely), pending the determination of the matter at the court of appeal,"" Danladi Umar, chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) said. 
The next court of appeal hearing is due to take place on Jan. 30.
Protestors gathered outside the courthouse in the capital, Abuja, on Monday - some in support of Onnoghen and others who backed his suspension. 
The CCT said on Jan. 12 that Onnoghen would face six counts of alleged non-declaration of assets. The allegations were initially made by Dennis Aghanya, who served as Buhari's media aide between 2009 and 2011. 
Onnoghen's lawyers said the tribunal did not have the authority to try him, and an appeal court ordered last week that the trial be halted while it ruled on that.
Buhari said on Friday his decision to suspend Onnoghen for the duration of the CCT trial was based on an order to do so from the tribunal dated Jan. 23 - the day before the court of appeal halted the proceedings.
The charges are yet to be disclosed. 
The president, in a series of tweets, said security agencies had traced ""suspicious transactions running into millions of dollars to the CJN's (Chief Justice of Nigeria's) personal accounts, all undeclared or improperly declared as required by law"". 
Onnoghen could not be reached to comment.
It is not the first time such claims have been leveled at the judiciary since Buhari, a former military ruler who vowed to crack down on corruption, took office in 2015. 
The Department of State Services, Nigeria's security agency, in 2016 said it seized $800,000 in cash during raids on judges from the supreme, appeal and high courts. Senior judges were arrested and released. None were convicted. 

Nigeria's judiciary has long been the subject of corruption allegations amid claims that judges routinely accept bribes in exchange for favorable rulings.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>","In a month, Venezuela's Guaido emerged from obscurity to challenge Maduro","(In 11th paragraph of Jan. 23 story, corrects to show Guaido studied political management at George Washington University but did not receive a master's degree in public administration there.)
By Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - In less than a month, Juan Guaido has gone from a virtual unknown in Venezuelan politics to the country's most-watched figure, assuming the presidency of the opposition-controlled congress and briefly being detained by the secret police.
On Wednesday, the skinny 35-year-old from the South American country's hardscrabble Caribbean coast thrust himself onto the international stage with the boldest challenge to socialist President Nicolas Maduro's rule in years: he declared himself interim president, a move swiftly recognized by the United States, Canada and many Latin American countries.
His rapid ascent has raised hopes that he could fill a leadership vacuum in Venezuela's notoriously divided opposition, which has failed in several attempts to oust Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez. Many of its most prominent figures have been jailed, exiled or barred from seeking public office.
The salsa-loving baseball fan has animated the opposition's upper-class base and won over many working-class Venezuelans fed up with the country's hyperinflationary economic collapse, who have taken to the streets demanding Maduro step down.
Yet Guaido still needs the backing of the armed forces to achieve his goal of forcing new elections.
""Today in Venezuela we are living under a dictatorship, and we need to put on enough pressure to take control,"" Guaido, the grandson of National Guard and Navy officers, said in an interview with Reuters this week. 
He has proposed an amnesty for members of the military, but said members of the Maduro government who committed human rights violations should be punished.
""I do not intend to heal the wounds of 20 years, but nor do I intend to hide them.""
Guaido took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5 with a call for the armed forces to recognize Maduro as a ""usurper"" after his May 2018 re-election vote, widely viewed as fraudulent.
The eldest of six children from a working-class family in the coastal state of Vargas, Guaido survived a devastating 1999 mudslide that posed one of the earliest tests to Chavez's 14-year rule. 
He went on to study engineering, but became involved in politics while in college and studied political management at George Washington University in the United States. He is married with a 1-year-old daughter.
For some years, the focus of the opposition - both of Guaido and his mentor, Leopoldo Lopez, the well-known head of the Popular Will party, currently under house arrest - has been ousting Maduro from power.
Representing Vargas for Popular Will, Guaido assumed the parliament's leadership as part of a power-sharing agreement between Venezuela's main opposition parties. He has said little about what policies he would pursue as president, but Popular Will describe themselves as center-left social democrats.
Guaido was dragged out of his car on the highway and detained by intelligence agents last week, but was swiftly released. Government officials said the officers responsible would be punished.
His whereabouts on Wednesday evening were unknown.
Guaido has said he is not afraid of being arrested, boosting his popularity among Venezuelans tired with Maduro.
""I am giving Guaido my vote of confidence,"" said Jose Luis Galindo, a Caracas firefighter wearing a gas mask around his neck at a protest against Maduro on Wednesday. 

""It is time to escape from this anarchy we have lived through for more than 20 years. I am here for my children's future, and I will stay for as long as it takes.""

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis warned on Sunday against excessive expectations for next month's Vatican summit on the global sexual abuse crisis, saying it was human problem that would continue.
Francis has summoned the presidents of all of the world's national bishops conferences to the Vatican Feb. 21-24.
The meeting offers a chance for him to respond to criticism from victims of abuse who say he has mishandled the crisis and not done enough to make bishops accountable for covering it up.
But the pope said the highly anticipated meeting would not end the problem.
""The preparatory work is going well but I permit myself to say that I have perceived that there is an inflated expectation,"" he told reporters on a plane returning from Panama.
""We have to deflate the expectations ... because the problem of abuse will continue because it is a human problem, and it is everywhere,"" he said.
Francis said one of the aims of the summit was for the bishops to go back home with what he called ""clear protocols"" on how to prevent abuse and help victims. 
More than 200 prelates are expected to attend. Heads of bishops conferences will attend sessions with the pope, abuse experts and victims.
""It is a human drama that we have to be conscious of, even us, resolving the problem in the Church, but also in society, in families,"" the pope said. 
The Church's response to the crisis has varied from country to country.
While clear and tough procedures to prevent abuse have been in place in countries such as the United States for more than a decade, other countries, particularly those in the developing world, are lagging.
Francis has repeatedly vowed zero tolerance for priests who abuse children, but critics have demanded more action.
He told reporters on the plane that the summit will include ""a penitential rite to ask forgiveness for the whole Church"".
Earlier this month, Vatican sources told Reuters that before the summit, disgraced former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick is almost certain to be defrocked over allegations against him, including sexual abuse of minors. [L8N1ZG3NN]
Last July, McCarrick became the first Catholic prelate in nearly 100 years to lose the title of cardinal. The allegations against him date back to decades ago when he was still rising to the top of the U.S. Church hierarchy.

McCarrick, 88, has responded publicly to only one of the allegations, saying he has ""absolutely no recollection"" of an alleged case of sexual abuse of a 16-year-old boy more than 50 years ago.

After unexpectedly losing an election to Mahathir Mohamad in May last year, Najib has been slapped with a series of corruption charges, mostly tied to losses at now-defunct state fund 1MDB.
The latest charges bring the total number against him to 42. 
Najib has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing. The first of his four trials starts on Feb. 12. 
Prosecutors on Monday alleged that Najib received in his private bank account a total of 47 million ringgit ($11.44 million) in proceeds of illegal activities, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters. 
A conviction on each charge would involve a maximum fine of 5 million ringgit or imprisonment of up to five years or both.
National news agency Bernama reported that Najib had pleaded not guilty to the new charges.
The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level officials at 1MDB and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Najib founded the fund. 
The new government led by Prime Minister Mahathir reopened investigations into 1MDB after the election victory.
Najib's former treasury chief, Mohamad Irwan Serigar Abdullah, and former 1MDB chief executive Arul Kanda Kandasamy have also been charged over 1MDB. They have both denied wrongdoing.
Malaysia last month filed charges against Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in connection with its role as underwriter and arranger of bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. 

Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",UNICEF boss urges Myanmar to enact Kofi Annan’s recommendations on Rohingya crisis,"YANGON (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. children’s fund urged Myanmar on Monday to implement the recommendations of a panel on the Rohingya crisis led by former U.N. head Kofi Annan, saying it had yet to create conditions right for the return of refugees from Bangladesh.
Speaking at a forum in the capital, Naypyitaw, UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said children from the Rohingya Muslim minority, a persecuted and mostly stateless community from Buddhist-majority Myanmar, were living “a precarious and an almost hopeless existence” in camps in neighboring Bangladesh. 
About 730,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine state, in western Myanmar, since a military crackdown in 2017 after Rohingya insurgents attacked security posts, U.N. agencies estimate. Tens of thousands remain behind in Rakhine, where they are subjected to restrictions on movement and have limited access to healthcare and education.
Fore said Myanmar’s “commitment” to enacting the recommendations of Annan’s committee – which include ensuring freedom of movement and access to education – would help mend the lives of suffering children.
“We urge the government to seize this moment and translate this potential into reality for all children,” she said on the first visit by a UNICEF head in decades. “Taking these steps will also go a long way toward creating the right conditions for the return of refugees from Bangladesh.”
The Annan commission was created by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 2016 to find long-term solutions to deep-seated ethnic and religious divisions in Rakhine.
But implementation of its recommendations has been beset by crises and setbacks.
A day after the panel issued its report in August 2017, Rohingya insurgents launched attacks on security forces, provoking a military crackdown the U.N. investigators described as ""ethnic cleansing"" with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies the charge.
In mid-2018, a Myanmar minister told Western diplomats that eight of Annan's recommendations - including one that asks authorities to take steps to amend the 1982 citizenship law that had rendered the Rohingya stateless - were problematic and could not be immediately fulfilled.
The commission's recommendations included points urging the government to ""immediately expand primary education to the communities in northern Rakhine State, and intensify efforts to ensure that teachers assigned to Muslim villages resume their work, including by providing adequate security when necessary"".
It also called on authorities to ""ensure that all children in the state have access to education in Myanmar language"" and that the tertiary education access is expanded.
In August, UNICEF warned of what it described as a ""lost generation"" of Rohingya children, with half a million in refugee camps in Bangladesh facing dangers including disease and floods and those still in Myanmar lacking access to proper education.

“We urge that the necessary steps are taken to enable their safe, voluntary and dignified return back to their homes where their rights are respected and they can once again live peaceably with their neighbors,” said Fore.

Iranian hackers are behind several cyber attacks and online disinformation campaigns in recent years as the country tries to strengthen its clout in the Middle East and beyond, a Reuters Special Report published in November found.
This month the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed a 2015 nuclear deal with Teheran, in a reaction to Iran's ballistic missile tests and assassination plots on European soil.
""Newly imposed sanctions on Iran are likely to push the country to intensify state-sponsored cyber threat activities in pursuit of its geopolitical and strategic objectives at a regional level,"" the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) said in a report.
A senior Iranian official rejected the report, saying ""these are all part of a psychological war launched by the United States and its allies against Iran"". 
ENISA lists state-sponsored hackers as among the highest threats to the bloc's digital security.
It said that China, Russia and Iran are ""the three most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic espionage"" 
Iran, Russia and China have repeatedly denied U.S. allegations that their governments conduct cyber attacks.
A malicious computer worm known as Stuxnet that was used to attack a uranium enrichment facility at Iran’s Natanz underground nuclear site a decade ago is widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel.
When Washington imposed sanctions on several Iranians in March 2018 for hacking on behalf of the Iranian government, Iran's foreign ministry denounced the move as ""provocative, illegitimate, and without any justifiable reason"". 
In November the United States indicted two Iranians for launching a major cyber attack using ransomware known as ""SamSam"" and sanctioned two others for helping exchange the ransom payments from Bitcoin digital currency into rials.
Cyber activities are expected to increase in coming months, particularly if Iran fails to keep the EU committed to a 2015 landmark nuclear deal, ENISA said.

Claude Verlon and Ghislaine Dupont, both journalists at RFI radio, were kidnapped and killed in the northern town of Kidal on Nov. 2 2013 by suspected Islamist militants. Their bodies were recovered near the four-wheel drive vehicle used by the abductors.
Hollande and ex-chief of the DGSE external intelligence services Bernard Bajolet were questioned earlier this month and in December over statements the president had made in private to journalists that appeared to contradict the investigation.

""There has been no talks, whether secret or not secret, about our missile program with France or any other country,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told a weekly news conference, broadcast live on state TV. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday France was ready to impose further curbs if no progress was made in talks over the program, described by Tehran as purely defensive but seen in the West as a destabilizing factor in a volatile region.
""Our missile program is a defensive program that we only discuss it inside the country. I cannot confirm holding any secret talks with France over our missile program,"" Qasemi said, when asked about Le Drian's remarks.
""We talk about regional and political issues with France ... but our missile capability is not negotiable ... we have repeatedly said that during our political talks with France.""
A U.N. Security Council resolution, which enshrined Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers in 2015, ""called upon"" Tehran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. 
Iran says its missile tests are not in violation of the resolution and denies its missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
U.S. President Donald Trump exited the deal in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.
As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harboring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran.
At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran's role in Syria's war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen.
But several bilateral talks on the ballistic missile program have yielded no results and France, Britain and Germany are now considering whether to push for sanctions and asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic's ballistic missile program, diplomats have told Reuters. 
Trump said the deal, which Tehran and other signatories are trying to salvage it, was flawed as it did not address ballistic missiles or Iran’s support for armed proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court will on Tuesday begin a review of its own acquittal of a Christian woman charged with blasphemy, a verdict that sparked days of Islamist protests and threats and chaos across the country.
Asia Bibi, who spent eight years on death row, has been in hiding since the Supreme Court freed her in October, with religious hardliners calling for her death and putting pressure on the government to prevent her from leaving the country.
Most reviews of Supreme Court verdicts are dismissed immediately, but the politically sensitive nature of the case has added an extra layer of uncertainty.
A three-judge panel, including the new Supreme Court Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, are due to hear the case.
Bibi's lawyer, Saif-ul-Malook, who fled to Europe due to fears for his safety last year, told Reuters he expected the case to be dismissed.
""They have filed the petition on flimsy grounds. They haven't attempted to counter her release on constitutional grounds,"" said Malook, who returned to Pakistan this week and will represent Bibi in court.
""God willing, she will have the decision in her favor tomorrow. She will be a free person to go anywhere she wants to."" 
Bibi is widely expected to seek asylum abroad due to safety concerns, with Canada among the favorites to accept her. In November, Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau said his country was in talks with Pakistan about helping Bibi.
Bibi, a farm worker, was condemned in 2010 over allegations that she made derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors working in the fields with her objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She has always denied committing blasphemy.
Leaders of the ultra-Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group blocked main roads in Pakistan's biggest cites for three days after Bibi's acquittal, calling for the murder of the Supreme Court judges who freed her and urging their cooks and servants to kill them.
The TLP called off the protests after striking a deal with the government that would see authorities seek to put Bibi on an ""exit control list"" barring her from leaving the country. The government later cracked down on TLP members, detaining more than 3,000 activists and pressing terrorism charges against the group's leaders.
Bibi's case has outraged Christians worldwide and reignited a debate about Pakistan's draconian blasphemy law, which critics say is often abused and unfairly targets ethnic minorities. 
""No one should be able to intimidate the Supreme Court into reversing a long-overdue ruling. Asia Bibi has been found to be innocent,"" said Omar Waraich, deputy South Asia director for Amnesty International.

""She should now finally be free to be reunited with her family and leave the country if she chooses.""

Al-Wefaq secretary-general Sheikh Ali Salman and two senior al-Wefaq leaders Sheikh Hassan Sultan and Ali Alaswad were sentenced to life imprisonment in November, overturning a previous acquittal.
The decision was made by the Bahrain's highest court of appeal, the Court of Cassation.
Al-Wefaq, which has strong links to the country's Shi'ite Muslim majority, has campaigned for social and political reforms in the country, which is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family.
Al-Wefaq said in a statement the ruling was made for ""political reasons"". 
The London-based human rights group Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) condemned the decision and said it marked the end of a ""long, flawed trial"". 
Since the Bahrain authorities crushed street protests in 2011, demonstrators have clashed frequently with security forces, who have been targeted by several bomb attacks. Manama says Qatar supports the unrest, accusations denied by Doha.

Sultan and Alaswad were tried in absentia. Salman is already serving a four-year prison sentence for inciting hatred and insulting the interior ministry, after he was arrested in 2015.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Desperate for five more years in power, India's Hindu nationalist government will woo rural and urban middle-class voters with farm relief measures and tax cuts, said officials privy to plans for the final budget before a general election.
Stung by opposition victories in three state polls last month, and needing to call a national election by May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing growing discontent over depressed farm incomes and doubts over whether his policies are creating enough jobs. 
The electoral compulsions mean that major economic reforms, such as tax cuts for bigger companies and plans to bring down the budget deficit, could be put on hold at least until after the election, the sources said.
Piyush Goyal, India's interim finance minister, will present the budget on Feb. 1, in the absence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is currently in the United States for medical treatment.
The higher spending, along with a shortfall in tax collections, will push the fiscal deficit up to the equivalent of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product for the year ending in March, overshooting a previous 3.3 percent target, according to one of the sources with direct knowledge of budget discussions.
That would fit with the expectations of a Reuters poll of economists.

The source said there was a chance that the government could take corrective action in March, hoping that by that time the election schedule will be settled and the public focus will shift toward campaigning. 
""We may resort to spending cuts in March to contain the fiscal deficit,"" the source said.
The finance ministry had cut capital and other spending amounting to 750.8 billion rupees ($10.55 billion) in the last financial year ending in March 2018. But Modi’s government has been stepping back from such fiscal rectitude in recent months.
In its desperation to find ways to pay for pre-election spending, the government has also pressed the central bank to part with more of its reserves, causing a rift that culminated in the resignation of the bank's governor last month. 
""This is an election budget, and most of the economic reforms have been put on hold,"" said another official, adding the government could defer any decision on business demands for a cut in corporate tax.
Business leaders said the government still has to meet its three-year old promise of cutting the corporate tax rate for larger companies to 25 percent from 30 percent. 
""Although all over the world overall tax has started coming down, India is one of the large economies which has corporate taxes on the higher side,"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India. 
The budget, which is interim and is likely to be followed by a full one in July, is expected to project economic growth of around 7.5 percent for the next financial year, while expanding capital spending on railways, roads, ports by 7-8 percent, and estimating an increase in revenue of about 15 percent, officials said. 
But the main focus will be on the rural sector and the urban middle-class. 
The government is ready with relief measures for farmers, benefits for unemployed youth, higher tax exemptions for the middle class and small businesses, the officials said.
According to two government sources, the farm relief package itself could run to at least one trillion rupees ($14 billion) if the government is to have a meaningful impact on which way voters lean in rural areas, where two-thirds of Indians live.
The pre-election giveaways could give the economy short term momentum, but result in a hangover after the election.
Credit rating agencies have warned that without bringing down other spending, a higher farm subsidy bill will increase future fiscal deficits.
""In the absence of new revenue boosting measures, the policies will collectively make it harder for the government to achieve its fiscal consolidation objectives,"" Moody's Investors Service said last week. 
LOOKING FOR JOBS 
Though he has spent big on building roads and railways, Modi has been fiscally conservative for most of his time in power, helping to bring retail inflation to near 2 percent from double-digits during the previous government's time.
Last month's state election upsets have made the Modi government shed some of that caution.
Despite expanding by 7 percent plus annually - the fastest pace among major economies, the uneven nature of the growth has meant that the economy has failed to create enough jobs for millions of youth entering the workforce each year.
Merchandise exports have shown no signs of growth in last four years, and some textile, leather and engineering goods producers have shifted production abroad. 
Earlier this month, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a leading independent think tank, issued a report showing the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year, making it even harder for new entrants to the labor market.
Last week, Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said India needed flexible labor and land laws, and to fix glitches in the Goods and Services Tax, launched as a major tax reform in 2017.
""We need two percentage points more growth to provide those jobs that are needed,"" said Rajan.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 04:02AM ET</span>",Explainer: Who is behind the Philippine church bombings?,"By Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines security forces investigating a deadly twin bombing at a church on a predominantly Muslim southern island are zeroing in on what they say is an affiliate of the militant Abu Sayyaf Group.
Twenty people were killed and more than 100 wounded in Sunday's attack on Jolo island, shocking a region that only days earlier delivered a resounding ""yes"" in a plebiscite on greater autonomy for the Muslim-dominated south.
WHO ARE THE MAIN SUSPECTS?
Jolo is a stronghold of the militant Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), making it a prime candidate.
More specifically, authorities believe the bomb attack was orchestrated by a faction called ""Ajang-Ajang"", which is notorious for kidnapping and extortion in Sulu province. It is the first time the military has mentioned this group.
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE?
Police believe Ajang-Ajang carried out the attack in revenge for the deaths of relatives killed during military operations against Abu Sayyaf.
According to Rommel Banlaoi, head of the Philippine Institute for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, the group's members consider themselves ""soldiers of martyrs"" and appear highly capable, having pulled off such a devastating attack when security was tight for the referendum.
""This group outsmarted law enforcement authorities,"" Banlaoi said. ""Sulu has been receiving threats coming from this group. This will inspire other groups to do some more.""
WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ABU SAYYAF?
Abu Sayyaf, which means ""Bearer of the Sword"", was founded in the 1990s with its roots in a separatist cause that it long since abandoned. It lacks a central command and operates in cells across the Sulu archipelago. 
The group has grabbed headlines for bombings and pledges of allegiance to Islamic State and links to al Qaeda, but its main activities have been piracy and kidnapping.
It is notorious for brutality, posting videos of captives, foreign and local, begging for their lives. Those for whom ransoms are not paid are often decapitated.
The ASG is fragmented, comprised of various clans or family-based factions operating under different commanders in different areas.
But ASG's radical streak cannot be ignored. Isnilon Hapilon, a faction commander from Basilan, was anointed as Islamic State's ""emir"" in Southeast Asia. He was credited with bringing together foreign fighters and members of various groups from Mindanao island to occupy Marawi City in 2017, under an alliance known as Dawla Islamiya, which sought to carve out an Islamic State territory.
The fighters held Marawi through five months of air strikes and ground operations, but collapsed within a week of the military killing Hapilon. His death does not appear to have weakened Abu Sayyaf.

CHURCH ATTACK LINKED TO ISLAMIC STATE?
Islamic State, via its Amaq news agency, claimed responsibility for the church attack, although the details it gave were not consistent with those from authorities. The group said the attack was twin suicide bombings, rather than remotely detonated devices, and its death toll appears to be exaggerated.
Security analyst Banlaoi considers Ajang-Ajang to be pro-Islamic State, noting that it is led by the father-in-law of Malaysian operative Amin Baco, who was involved in planning the Marawi occupation.
RESPONSE TO REFERENDUM?
That has been widely assumed and should not be ruled out. The region as a whole voted overwhelmingly in support of autonomy, although the plan was narrowly rejected in Sulu, where some influential politicians had opposed it, including a Supreme Court challenge.
The separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which opposes the Abu Sayyaf, is likely to dominate the transition authority and the elected government of the new Bangsamoro administration. That could threaten some political interests and patronage arrangements in Sulu and be seen as a challenge to Abu Sayyaf's power. However, the timing of the bombings - six days after the vote - raises some doubts.
IS AN ABU SAYYAF DEFEAT LIKELY?
Not soon. Offensives from 2001 by the Philippine military with help of U.S. special forces under ""Operation Enduring Freedom"" made some progress in killing senior commanders but that led to splintering and increased kidnapping to raise funds. In recent years, ASG has started to engage more in piracy.
President Rodrigo Duterte has offered talks but has also promised to wipe them out. He has created a Jolo-based infantry division, to be comprised of 4,500 troops by 2022, to go after the ASG and last month oversaw the deployment of its first 840 personnel.

In a Jan. 9 report, the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict argued that non-military measures were key to defeating ASG. It advocated capturing and interviewing militants rather than killing them, which could be ""critical to understanding ASG networks and identifying possible policy interventions"".

673,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2019 02:35AM ET</span>","Pilot had 'emotional breakdown' before deadly crash, Nepal probe panel says","By Gopal Sharma
KATHMANDU (Reuters) - The captain of a Bangladeshi aeroplane ""seemed to have an emotional breakdown"" before a deadly crash last March, Nepali investigators said in a final report on the Himalayan nation's worst aviation disaster in 26 years.
They blamed the crew's loss of situational awareness for the crash of the US-Bangla Airlines flight to the Nepali capital from Dhaka that caught fire on landing in Kathmandu, killing 51 of the 71 people aboard.
""The pilot thought he could maneuver the aircraft and land. But he could not,"" panel official Buddhisagar Lamichhane, told Reuters on Monday, referring to the captain.
The captain was under stress and ""emotionally disturbed"" because he felt that a female colleague who was not on board the fatal flight had questioned his reputation as a good instructor, Nepal's Accident Investigation Commission said in the report.
""This, together with the failure on the part of both the crew to follow the standard operating procedure at the critical stage of the flight, contributed to the loss of situational awareness,"" said the report, submitted late on Sunday.
This lack of awareness meant the crew did not realize the deviation of the aircraft, a  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) Q400 turboprop, from its intended path, which in turn meant they could not sight the runway, it added.
Having missed the runway, the crew was flying very low north of it in an incorrect position near hilly and mountainous terrain around the airport, it said.
""Finally, when the crew sighted the runway, they were very low and too close to (it) and not properly aligned,"" added the report, saying the captain should have halted the landing and initiated a go-around.
The plane skidded off the runway on to surrounding grass, quickly catching fire. Both pilots were among those killed.
US-Bangla Airlines expects to make an official statement later on Monday, Chief Executive Imran Asif said.
MENTAL HEALTH
The flight's captain, aged 52, was released in 1993 from the Bangladeshi Air Force because he suffered from depression but was later declared fit to fly civilian aircraft, the report said, with recent medical reports mentioning no symptoms.
Citing the voice recorder and the eyewitness accounts of passengers, the report said the captain was smoking in the cockpit during the flight and ""engaged in unnecessary, unprofessional and lengthy conversation even in the critical phase,"" violating the norm of maintaining a sterile cockpit. 
He shared the cockpit with a female first officer, 25, who had a total of just 390 hours of flying experience and had never previously landed at Kathmandu as crew, the report said, contradicting a US-Bangla spokesman who last year said she had made landings there before.
Landing at Kathmandu airport, which is surrounded by hills, is considered difficult. In 1992, all 167 on board a Pakistan International Airlines aeroplane were killed when it plowed into a hill as it tried to land.
On the US-Bangla flight, the disparity in experience and added authority of the captain probably deterred the first officer from being more assertive during significant phases such as the final approach and landing, the report said.
The report recommended that the airline emphasize proper crew resource management and set up a mechanism to monitor and assess the mental status of the crew regarding professional development, financial, personal and psychological issues.
Pilot mental health was spotlighted by a 2015 crash in Europe after a Germanwings first officer deliberately flew a jet into a mountainside. 

Last year, the European Commission adopted new rules on the mental health of pilots, for the first time requiring airlines to do a psychological assessment before hiring them.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Monday jailed prominent rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang for 4-1/2 years for subversion of state power, a sentence denounced by Human Rights Watch as a ""mockery"" of Beijing's claims to champion the rule of law.
Wang, who had taken cases deemed sensitive by authorities, such as accusations of police torture or defending members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, went missing in August 2015 amid a crackdown on rights activists and lawyers.
In a short statement on its website, the Tianjin Number 2 Intermediate People's Court in the northern port city of Tianjin said that Wang had been found guilty.
It is not possible to contact Wang for comment. 
After Wang's Dec. 26 hearing, the United Nations called on authorities to ""ensure his due process rights are respected"" and said that there were ""serious human rights concerns"" about the way his case had been handled.
The verdict makes a ""mockery"" of President Xi Jinping's claims to champion the rule of law, Wang Yaqiu, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
China's criminal law requires that time spent in detention prior to sentencing be deducted, suggesting Wang could be released earlier than his 4-1/2 year jail term, she said.
The Justice Ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the case.
During his court appearance, Wang fired his state-appointed lawyer, according to his wife Li Wenzu, who was barred from leaving her Beijing home and could not attend the trial.
It is not known if Wang defended himself during the trial or whether he will appeal the sentence.
Li said in a statement on Twitter that her husband was innocent and the ""inhuman"" behavior of law enforcement officials toward Wang was a violation of Chinese law.
""I respect and support every choice that Wang Quanzhang has made. I will continue to defend Wang Quanzhang's rights,"" she said.
Li has championed her husband's case since he went missing, staging a 100 km (62 miles) march from Beijing to Tianjin, shaving her head to protest his treatment and filing almost weekly petitions to the Supreme People's Court.
Wang's case has been shrouded in secrecy and uncertainty, as authorities have released little information about his well-being and have denied access to Li and the seven lawyers she has appointed to defend him.
One of the lawyers, Yu Wensheng, had been Wang's defense attorney, before he was stripped of his license and then arrested in January. He is now being investigated for ""inciting subversion"".
Police turned Western diplomats and foreign journalists away from the courthouse on the day of Wang's hearing and detained activist Yang Chunlin, who went to Tianjin to support him.
An indictment document from 2017 said that Wang had ""for a long time been influenced by infiltrating anti-China forces"" and had been trained by overseas groups and accepted their funding.

China routinely rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record, saying all Chinese are treated equally in accordance with the law and that foreign countries have no right to interfere.

Doctors have recommended that Bolsonaro, 63, rest for 48 hours after the surgery, during which time Vice President Hamilton Mourao will be acting president, according to a statement from the president's office.
The procedure will sideline the right-wing Bolsonaro during a serious mining disaster in the state of Minas Gerais, where a dam burst at a iron ore mine, releasing a torrent of mud that killed at least 58 people and left hundreds missing.
Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, checked into the hospital in Sao Paulo on Sunday and later posted a video to Twitter dressed in a hospital gown, summarizing recent events including his flight over the mining disaster site in the town of Brumadinho.
He said the disaster ""affects us all, and we are in solidarity with the families of the victims.""
Disaster rescue efforts are being led by state authorities, and Bolsonaro has convened a council of ministers to support local efforts.
Bolsonaro's surgery is expected to last three hours, he said, and he is expected to stay in the hospital for 10 days.

His advisers will set up meetings in the antechamber to his recovery room to allow for day-to-day governance after he takes over from Mourao, according to the president's office.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots have touched down in Atlanta after enthusiastic send-offs from their fans ahead of their Super Bowl clash on Sunday.
An estimated 35,000 Patriots fans packed into Gillette Stadium in Foxborough to cheer on the team, which is looking to avenge their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in last year's championship game.
""This is the biggest sendoff we've ever had,"" said Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who has been at the helm for all five of the franchise's Super Bowl victories.
""Appreciate your support all year ... hope to see you in Atlanta.""
Quarterback Tom Brady took a shot at the team's detractors, who thought this might be the year that the 41-year-old started to falter and the team's unprecedented run of success would finally come to an end.
""We're still here,"" an animated Brady told the crowd before tossing the microphone aside. 
In Los Angeles, throngs of Rams fans showed up for a rally at the site of the team's future stadium in Inglewood.
""I've been here for three years and seeing us go from 4-12 three years ago to going to the Super Bowl now is amazing,"" said Rams quarterback Jared Goff.
""We appreciate all the support and we're ready to bring a Lombardi Trophy back to LA.""
Rams running back Todd Gurley also told fans to expect the team to return from Atlanta with some new hardware.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - There is no proof that Beijing's detention of a Chinese-born Australian writer is related to the arrest of Canadians in China, Australian Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said on Monday.
Yang Hengjun was detained in southern China earlier this month and taken to Beijing where China has said he was held under ""coercive measures"", a euphemism for detention, as he is being investigated on suspicion of ""endangering state security"".
""In terms of the detention of Mr. Yang, I don’t see any evidence that the detention of Mr. Yang is linked to decisions made by the Australian government in recent times. Nor do I see it being linked to the detention of the two Canadians, Pyne told a security forum in Singapore.
Pyne held talks in Beijing last week aimed at repairing ties with Australia's largest trading partner that have been strained since 2017, when it accused China of meddling in its affairs.
Pyne said he had spoken to Chinese authorities during his trip to ""ensure that he (Yang) has been well cared for, treated fairly and transparently"". 
Tensions have risen in recent weeks between China and some Western countries after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Australia joined international condemnation of the arrest of the Canadians, but Yang has long been in the sights of Chinese authorities. He has criticized what he described as Chinese interference in Australia.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2019 07:26PM ET</span>",Emissions angst fuels new tensions in loveless German coalition,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Tensions in Germany's loveless ruling coalition flared on Sunday after Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a conservative from the car-making state of Bavaria, called for a reassessment of limits on vehicle emissions.
Scheuer told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper he would raise the issue, and could push for changes, at the next meeting of European Union transport ministers following the publication last week of a letter in which more than 100 doctors questioned current limits on the emission of particulates.
He said Germany should ""end the masochistic debates in which we in Germany harm ourselves with ever-tougher limits"", and he rejected imposing speed limits on German motorways to curb emissions and help meet climate protection goals.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in the coalition, shot back in an interview in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that current limits were fact-based and there no reason to revise them.
""We should support communities with clean air programs instead of letting ourselves succumb to diversionary tactics,"" she said. ""That includes, for example, pushing for retrofits of diesel cars as quickly as possible.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition has been deeply strained over whether to impose driving bans or require car companies to retrofit vehicles to lower emissions following Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission more than three years ago that it deliberately cheated U.S. pollution tests.
Critics say conservatives have sought to shield the car companies from the high costs associated with retrofits.
The latest dispute comes after Merkel' fragile coalition nearly collapsed last summer over disagreements on migration, and then ran into trouble after the former chief of domestic intelligence presented himself as the victim of a witch-hunt by ""radical-left forces"" in the SPD.
Scheuer's comments also drew criticism from the opposition Greens party. In the same Bild am Sonntag interview, he accused German environmental groups that favor driving bans of trying to destroy the country's car industry.
The longstanding debate over emissions and driving bans sparked headlines last week after the doctors' letter.
Dieter Koehler, a former president of the German Respiratory Society who co-authored the letter, said on a talk show on broadcaster ARD on Sunday that the EU emission limits were ""completely absurd"" and not based on hard science.

Heinz-Erich Wichmann, an epidemiologist who helped develop the World Health Organization guidelines that underpin EU standards, countered that Koehler was ""a complete outsider"" and that the German Respiratory Society itself rejected his letter.

""Deputies challenged him and he surrendered without incident and is at NNRJ (Northern Neck Regional Jail) without bond,"" the Richmond County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter.
Theriot will be taken back to Louisiana to face charges including first-degree homicide, home invasion and illegal use of weapons, the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana said.

Both counties are in the Baton Rouge area and about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from where he was arrested a day after the killings.

CAIRO (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday human rights in Egypt were perceived as worse now than under former strongman Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled by protests in 2011.
His comments marked a hardening after he said in 2017 he would not ""lecture"" President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi over civil liberties, which activists say are being eroded.
""I think current policies are perceived by intellectuals and Egypt's civil society as tougher than under the Mubarak regime,"" Macron told reporters on the sidelines of a trip to Egypt.
Mubarak, a former air force commander, was jailed for conspiring to kill demonstrators who ended his three-decade rule, but he was freed on appeal in 2017.
""I can't see how you can pretend to ensure long-term stability in this country, which was at the heart of the Arab Spring and showed its taste for freedom, and think you can continue to harden beyond what's acceptable or justified for security reasons,"" Macron added.
""I think that's becoming paradoxical and harmful for Egypt itself.""
Non-governmental organizations are pressuring Macron to be firm with the Egyptian president, who in April secured a second term, shoring up his position as a power-broker in the region.
Macron said he would be more outspoken during the three-day trip, which began on Sunday, and would also mention individual cases in private. He was to meet Sisi on Monday.
Sisi's critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, rocked by years of unrest after the fall of Mubarak.
In an interview earlier this month, Sisi denied that Egypt was holding political prisoners, though one rights group estimates the number at 60,000.
In October 2017, Macron gave Sisi, who was visiting Paris, a list of activists he believed could be released from prison. 
On Sunday, he said only two of them had been freed, which he considered ""unsatisfactory.""
""I will at the same time have a confidential dialogue on individual cases and speak out more distinctly, as well as have symbolic exchanges, because I think that's in the interest of President Sisi and Egypt's stability,"" Macron said.

""In Egypt, we're not only talking about political opponents who are being imprisoned, but opponents who are part of the traditional democratic sphere and are not threatening the regime. Journalists, homosexuals, women and men of conviction.""

Some 10,000 people turned out for Sunday's counter-demonstration, a day after an 11th consecutive Saturday of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations across France that brought sporadic clashes with police.
Participants, some wearing red scarves after the name of the counter-movement, displayed slogans like ""stop the violence"" and ""hands off my Republic"" in a peaceful afternoon procession in eastern Paris that ended in Bastille square.
Saturday's ""yellow vest"" march in the capital also ended at Bastille, where small groups confronted police and a demonstrator suffered an eye wound that inflamed a debate about whether the authorities are using excessive force. 
The ""yellow vest"" protesters, who wear the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to have in their cars, took to the streets in November to oppose a fuel tax rise. Their movement then developed into a broader revolt against the government.
Around 69,000 people attended the latest Saturday protests, including 4,000 in Paris, a lower turnout than the previous weekend, the interior minister said.
However, the injury to well-known activist Jerome Rodrigues attracted more television coverage on Sunday than the ""red scarves"" march, as it heightened debate over use by police of dispersal grenades and so-called ""flashball"" pellet guns.

To help quell discontent, Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he has promised will lead to changes.

Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League and Luigi Di Maio of the populist, anti-establishment 5-Star movement, have sought to rile Macron on a host of inflammatory issues.
""I won't answer, that's what they're waiting for. So good luck to them, enjoy the agitation, enjoy the ride, as far as I'm concerned, I speak to President Conte,"" Macron told reporters on on Sunday the sidelines of a trip to Egypt. 
Conte sought to ease an increasingly harsh war of words between Rome and Paris earlier this week by saying that relations between Italy and France remained strong.
Di Maio accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa while Salvini accused France of doing nothing to bring peace to Libya. 
Asked about Salvini and Di Maio's remarks, Macron said: ""All of this has frankly no importance.""

""Italy is a great people, the Italian people is our friend, and deserves leaders worthy of its history,"" Macron added.

""Both parties agreed tentatively to reconvene on February 25th,"" the official told Reuters.
The draft deal, agreed after six days of talks last week, stipulates that U.S. troops would leave within 18 months of the agreement being signed, potentially ending the war more than 17 years after American-led forces invaded Afghanistan.
According to Taliban sources, the hardline Islamic group gave assurances that Afghanistan will not be allowed to be used by al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants to attack the United States and its allies - a key early demand of Washington.
The reported progress comes as the Taliban continues to stage near-daily attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and its security forces.
Despite the presence of U.S.-led foreign forces training, advising and assisting their Afghan counterparts, the Taliban controls nearly half of Afghanistan.

The two parties gathered in different parts of the camp, now an open-air museum, and did not encounter each other. It was the first time the far right has held a protest at Auschwitz at the annual event, which is also International Holocaust Victims Remembrance Day. 
At the official ceremony on Sunday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and other government officials were joined in prayer by some of the last remaining survivors of the death camp.
In another location at the site, far right protesters wrapped in Polish flags, some stamped with the words ""Polish Holocaust"", laid flowers and sang the Polish national anthem.
""The Jewish nation and Israel is doing everything to change the history of the Polish nation,"" said Piotr Rybak of the Polish Independence Movement, who led Sunday's protest. ""Polish patriots cannot allow this.""
Asked by an opposition politician on Twitter how long it would take the government to react to such situations, Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski wrote: ""React to what? To the fact that someone is not in their right mind and blames all the evil in this world and his frustrations on a particular nation?""
""If you are trying to blame this government for anti-Semitism in the heads of seriously crazy (I believe) fools, it is indecent and unwise,"" he added.
The protest comes at a time of surging anti-Semitism in parts of Europe and as critics accuse the PiS of trying to build a nationalist sense of grievance among Poles by seeking to minimize Polish complicity in the Holocaust.
During decades of communist rule, Poles were taught to believe that, with a few exceptions, the nation had conducted itself honorably during a war that killed a fifth of the population.
Many still refuse to accept research showing thousands participated in the Holocaust -- in addition to the thousands that had risked their lives to help the Jews -- and feel the West has failed to recognize Poland's own wartime suffering.
More than 3 million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Jews from across Europe were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by the Germans on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.
According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.

Diplomatic relations between Poland and Israel were strained last year after the PiS government sought to impose jail terms for suggesting the nation was complicit in the Holocaust.

A museum employee called in to say video surveillance footage showed the thieves simply took the painting off the wall and made their escape, the police said.
The work, ""Ai Petri. Crimea"", was painted in 1908 by Arkhip Kuindzhi, a Russian artist of Greek origin, and depicts a mountain in the Crimea peninsula.
Russian news agencies said the painting was stolen from the Tretyakov gallery, one of Russia's leading art galleries, which has been targeted by criminals several times in recent years.
The gallery could not be immediately reached for comment.
Last May, one of the country's most treasured 19th century art works, which depicts Tsar Ivan the Terrible cradling his dying son, was damaged by a man with a metal rod. 

Kuindzhi is known for his landscapes. His 1881 work ""Birch grove"" was sold at auction house Sotheby's for over $3 million in 2008.

""Parties to the conflict are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians,"" said Lise Grande, humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. ""The people who have fled their home to IDP (internally displaced person) sites have lost so much already. An attack like this cannot be justified - ever.""
The U.N. statement did not identify the source of the shelling, which occurred on Saturday.
The war has largely been in a stalemate for years, with a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and Yemeni allies unable to dislodge the Iran-allied Houthi movement that controls the capital and most major population centers.
At recent talks in Sweden, the warring parties agreed a ceasefire in Hodeidah, the country's main port, but then failed to pull out their troops, a confidence-building step that could pave the way for political talks to end the almost four-year war.
The truce has largely held but sporadic clashes intensified last week, with each side accusing the other of violating the deal.
If fighting restarts in earnest around the port, the main supply route into the country could be cut off, leaving no way to feed millions of people on the verge of starvation. 
Wheat silos in Hodeidah were damaged by a fire caused by suspected mortar shelling, threatening food supplies for millions of hungry people, the United Nations said on Friday.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq must wean itself off economic reliance on Iran and become more energy self-sufficient, Britain's foreign office minister for the Middle East said on Sunday.
Alistair Burt visited Iraq after a flurry of high-profile diplomacy in Baghdad this month that followed U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement he was pulling American troops out of Syria.
U.S. allies worry the withdrawal, even if it proceeds more slowly than initially planned, will embolden Iran, whose influence has grown in Iraq and Syria in recent years.
Washington hopes to counter Iranian influence through renewed sanctions, and has pressured Iraq to halt imports of Iranian gas.
""To expect Iran to have no influence in Iraq is fanciful,"" Burt said in an interview with Reuters at the British Embassy in Baghdad.
""What is important is that Iraq finds the opportunity to follow its own future in terms of foreign relations and that its economy is strong, and isn't reliant on Iran.""
Burt said Iraq must convert oil resources to become more self-sufficient. ""The sooner all its oil wealth can come on stream and can capture all the energy that is sometimes not used as effectively as possible ... the better,"" he said.
Iraq's oil export capacity is nearly 5 million barrels per day, although it is pumping below capacity in line with an OPEC agreement to reduce production to stabilize prices. Washington hopes it can reduce its gas flaring to satisfy domestic energy needs and rely less on Iranian power imports.
Burt said there were ideas for more power projects in Iraq, without elaborating.
U.S.-IRAN TENSIONS MOUNT
He doubted that a military escalation between the United States and Iran in Iraq or Syria was imminent, but warned of ""confrontation which might occur should there be a miscalculation.""
Tension has ramped up between Washington's chief regional ally Israel, and Iran and its allies in Syria and Iraq in recent weeks. Israel struck what it said were Iranian targets near Damascus on Monday in an increasingly open assault on Iran's presence there.

Burt said Britain remained concerned about the threat from Islamic State in the region especially after the U.S. decision to withdraw troops, and that London would continue to support Baghdad's efforts against remaining IS militants who have stepped up insurgent-style attacks in Iraq.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Firefighters on Sunday called for the evacuation of some 24,000 people from the Brazilian town hit by a deadly mudslide from a ruptured mining dam as rains added to concerns a second dam could collapse. 
Sirens began blaring before dawn, triggered by dangerous water levels at a tailings dam still standing near an iron ore mine owned by Vale SA near Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state. 
""We have a situation of imminent risk, but there hasn't been a rupture of this dam until now and we are monitoring it,"" said Pedro Aihara, a spokesman for the state fire department.
He said they believed the situation was dangerous, but he could not comment on the actual risk of another dam break. The second dam being monitored is about 50 meters (0.03 mile) from the burst dam and part of a large industrial complex.
The evacuation efforts diverted attention from the search for hundreds of people missing after Friday's burst dam unleashed a torrent of mud, burying the mining facilities and nearby homes.
""Our work is completely focused on the evacuation,"" Aihara said.
Roughly 250 people were still missing after the tailings dam accident, according to a list released by Vale, the second such disaster in less than four years. Most of the missing are presumed dead, officials said.
The confirmed death toll rose to 37 by Sunday morning, according to the fire department.
The disaster is now more deadly than a 2015 tailings dam collapse at an iron ore mine less than 100 km (60 miles) to the east, belonging to Samarco Mineracao SA, a Vale joint venture with BHP Group. 
The Samarco dam break spilled five times the mining waste into a more remote region, killing 19 people, burying a small village and contaminating a major river in Brazil's worst environmental disaster on record.
In Brumadinho, families and friends mourning their lost loved ones were forced to evacuate on Sunday.
""FED UP""
Renato Maia, a 44-year-old salesman whose best friend's daughter remained missing, fled his home in panic early Sunday morning. At midday he and his wife waited on the outskirts of town for police to lift a blockade, angry at the situation.
""We're all fed up with Vale ... and this is really adding to the tension,"" he said. ""It was a huge tragedy and now we don't know what might come next.""
The Brazilian government has ordered Vale to halt operations at the Corrego do Feijao mining complex, the site of the Friday dam burst. Courts have frozen 6 billion reais ($1.6 billion) in Vale's asses to pay for the damage.
Vale Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman apologized without taking responsibility in an television interview on Saturday.
""Apologies to society, apologies to you, apologies to the whole world for what has happened,"" he said. ""I don't know who is responsible, but you can be sure we'll do our part.""
The cause of the dam burst remained unclear. Recent inspections by a German auditor TUV SUD and Vale did not indicate any problems with the dam, the companies said.
Federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Sampaio told Reuters on Saturday that state and federal authorities have failed to apply more stringent regulation to the hundreds of tailings dams around the country.

Schvartsman said all of Vale's tailings dams were checked after the 2015 disaster and periodic reviews are carried out.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro rejected an international ultimatum to call elections within eight days and said opposition leader Juan Guaido violated the constitution by declaring himself interim leader.
Israel on Sunday joined a growing list of countries led by the United States that back Guaido's claim to the presidency on the basis that Maduro's second-term election victory was fraudulent. 
Maduro, in an interview with CNN Turk aired on Sunday, also said he was open to dialogue and that meeting U.S. President Donald Trump was improbable but not impossible. The broadcaster dubbed the interview from Spanish into Turkish.
Washington on Saturday urged the world to ""pick a side"" on Venezuela and financially disconnect from Maduro's government.
While Maduro's government looks increasingly isolated internationally, it retains the support of China and Russia. 
Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year.
Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognize Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was ""absurd"" and the Venezuelan foreign minister called ""childlike."" 
Washington, Canada, most Latin American nations and many European states have labeled Maduro's second-term election win last May fraudulent. The successor to late President Hugo Chavez cruised to victory after blocking the main opposition candidates from running. Turnout was low.
""Israel joins the United States, Canada, most of the countries of Latin America and countries in Europe in recognizing the new leadership in Venezuela,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement.
Maduro retains the loyalty of the armed forces, though Venezuela's top military envoy to the United States on Saturday defected to Guaido.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had voiced his support for Maduro in a phone call on Thursday.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said an open-air Mass before a huge crowd on Sunday to wrap up a jamboree of Catholic youth, the last big event before he returns to Rome to prepare for a historic trip to the Arabian Peninsula in one week. 
Organizers said about 700,000 people attended the closing Mass of World Youth Day, which takes place in a different city every three years. The next jamboree, which has been dubbed the ""Catholic Woodstock,"" will be in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2022.
Many of the young people in the crowd spent the night on the fields of a park named after Pope John Paul, who was the last pontiff to visit Panama, in 1983.
In his closing homily at the Mass, which started unusually early at 8 a.m., because of the sweltering tropical heat, Francis urged the young people to work against ""fear and exclusion, speculation and manipulation.""
After a week at the Vatican, Francis leaves on Sunday for a three-day trip to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where he will become the first pope to visit the Arabian Peninsula and say the first Mass in a public venue there. There are about one million Roman Catholics in the UAE, all of them expatriate workers.
The freedom to practice Christianity — or any religion other than Islam — is not a given in the Gulf and varies from country to country. In the UAE and Kuwait, Christians may worship in churches or church compounds and in other places with special licenses. Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites, bans the practice of other religions. 
During the Panama trip, the themes of migration and the Church's sexual abuse crisis loomed large.
Francis said at one event that it was ""senseless and irresponsible"" to stigmatize migrants and see all of them as threats to society, weighing in again on one of the most divisive issues in the United States.
He spoke several times of the need for ""bridges, not walls,"" again putting himself at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump, who on Friday agreed under mounting pressure to end a 35-day partial U.S. government shutdown but without getting the $5.7 billion he had demanded from Congress for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Trump has repeatedly warned about the dangers of illegal immigrants, and said the wall would help solve the problem. 
On Saturday, Francis said the Roman Catholic Church was weary and ""wounded by her own sin,"" in an apparent reference to the global sexual abuse crisis.
Later, at a lunch with a delegation of young people, he told the American representative that clergy sexual abuse was a ""horrible crime"" and that the Church should be united in fighting it.
Francis has called a summit of the heads of national Catholic churches at the Vatican Feb. 21-24 to discuss what is now a global sexual abuse crisis.

The February meeting offers a chance for him to respond to criticism from victims of abuse that he has stumbled in his handling of the crisis and has not done enough to make bishops accountable.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2019 09:54AM ET</span>",'El Chapo's' lawyers face tough choices at trial's end,"By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - With federal prosecutors expected to rest their case against Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman on Monday, lawyers for the accused Mexican drug kingpin have given few clues about how they plan to counter three months of testimony by more than 50 government witnesses.
Among the tough choices they face are whether to call their own witnesses to try to undermine the prosecutors' evidence, and whether Guzman should take the stand in his own defense. One of his attorneys said on Friday that they would not reveal the names of any witnesses unless they decided to call them. 
""Similarly, we will not disclose Joaquin's plans about testifying until the time comes to inform the court,"" Guzman lawyer Eduardo Balarezo said in a statement.
Guzman, 61, the alleged leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, was extradited to the United States in 2017. He has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking vast quantities of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs into the country. Prosecutors have called more than a dozen former cartel members to testify against him.
The main defense argument, as put forth by Guzman lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman in his opening statement, has been that the real leader of the Sinaloa Cartel is Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, and that Zambada bribed the Mexican and U.S. governments to frame Guzman.
Guzman's lawyers have discussed multiple potential witnesses with prosecutors in open court, and have filed a motion suggesting they might call an inmate in the U.S. prison system, but they have not publicly revealed any names.""
Defendants in criminal cases are under no obligation to call any witnesses. Many defendants in organized crime cases do not, said defense lawyer Steven Boozang, who defended Boston mafia boss Francis ""Cadillac Frank"" Salemme in a murder trial last year. He said the decision depends on what exonerating evidence is available. 
""It has to be reliable,"" he said. ""It has to be truthful.""
Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, said it could make sense for a defendant to call witnesses if they could offer the jury an alternative explanation of the evidence that proved a defendant's innocence. But he said such witnesses can backfire if their testimony is not convincing.
Lichtman said evidence for the defense's contention that Zambada framed Guzman would emerge from the prosecution's own witnesses, but such testimony largely failed to materialize. Multiple witnesses described Guzman as either the boss of the cartel or an equal partner with Zambada. The most explosive allegations about bribery came when one witness said Guzman paid $100 million to former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto. Pena Nieto has denied taking any bribes.
In many cases, Honig said, the only viable defense strategy is to seek to undermine prosecution witnesses who have pleaded guilty to crimes and agreed to cooperate. 
""Tell the jury, 'You just heard a bunch of tales from a bunch of lying criminal scoundrels who simply want to please the government, and my guy is their meal ticket,'"" he said.
Guzman's lawyers have sharply interrogated cooperating witnesses about their own criminal histories, which have included convictions not only for drug dealing but also murder plots, tax evasion, money laundering and forgery.
In Guzman's case, the strategy may have limits. Much of the evidence against him is intercepted electronic messages in which Guzman himself appears to discuss drug deals, and his lawyers have not so far challenged their authenticity.
Boozang said Guzman's lawyers were sure to discourage their client from testifying himself, which would let prosecutors cross-examine him. 
""Putting on the defendant, it's almost never done,"" Boozang said, adding that the prosecution ""would most likely have a field day"" with Guzman.
But the alleged cartel boss may ignore his attorneys. Numerous witnesses have described him as boastful and impulsive.

In recent years, Guzman has courted publicity, seeking to make a movie about his life and giving an interview to actor Sean Penn for Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. In a Brooklyn courtroom, he could find his biggest stage yet.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Toys, house keys and diaries hang suspended from the ceiling or sit on plain white pedestals at Sarajevo's War Childhood Museum in a simple tribute to the children living in the shadow of the war in Syria. 
Driven by memories of his own childhood during the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, founder Jasminko Halilovic has made the museum a treasure trove of personal items donated by those who were children then too.
He now wants to turn it into the world's biggest archive on wartime childhoods. Sunday's exhibition relied on items donated by children in Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon. A colorful keychain in the shape of sandal was given to the museum by 15-year-old Marwa.
""The keys opened the doors to the most beautiful house I have ever seen. My room had pink and green walls. Unfortunately, the house burned during the war, so we don't have the house anymore,"" she wrote.
According to UNICEF, there are 2.5 million Syrian refugee children living outside Syria and 2.6 million internally displaced. 
""We want to show that war children are not only the passive victims, as we often see them, but also resilient survivors,"" Halilovic said.
Having amassed more than 4,000 exhibits and over 150 hours of a video archive of oral history interviews, his team started collecting personal items from children affected by other wars, such as Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan.
The Syrian collection was assembled with the help of Abed Moubayed, 35, from Aleppo, during his two-month internship with the museum, part of his master degree program in post-war recovery at the University of York.
""This is a chance for the Syrian children to raise their voices and tell the whole world about their experience and suffering. It is really important to show that history is repeating itself and we, all of us, need to do something to stop it,"" Moubayed, who left Syria in 2012, told Reuters.
""Syrian children have no idea what the future holds for them and you can see it from their stories.""

President Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking a second term in office, suspended Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen on Friday over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules, drawing criticism at home and abroad. 
The opposition called it an act of dictatorship and halted its election campaign for 72 hours in protest. The EU election observation team said Onnoghen's suspension raised concerns about the ""opportunity for electoral justice"". 
""FG [federal government] determined to ensure free, fair elections. This government will not bend the rules, and will not allow meddling in our affairs,"" read a statement issued late on Saturday by Buhari's spokesman, Garba Shehu.
Coming hours after statements expressing concern were issued by the E.U., U.S. and Britain, the statement said the government would ""reject any interference or perception management that promotes apprehension"" about the outcome of the election. 
Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him.

Buhari, who took office in 2015 after winning an election largely on his vow to fight corruption and improve security, is a retired general who was a military ruler in the 1980s.

KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Sunday to try to secure cooperation from Afghanistan's president after breakthroughs in peace negotiations with Taliban leaders in Qatar.
With Khalilzad and his boss U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well Taliban officials, hailing progress toward ending America's longest war, he must now win over President Ashraf Ghani -- whose government the Taliban have so far kept out of the process. 
Six days of talks ended in Qatar on Saturday with key parts of a draft pact mapped out, including an 18-month timeline for the withdrawal of foreign troops after the completion of a deal, according to Taliban officials.
The draft also includes assurances from the hardline Islamic group that it will not allow Afghanistan to be used by al-Qaeda and Islamic State to attack the U.S. and its allies - a core U.S. demand. Similar assurances involving other groups are given to Pakistan in the draft pact.
The Taliban also want to be part of an interim government after any ceasefire, Taliban sources said.
It was not clear whether the draft described by the Taliban sources was acceptable to both sides or when it could be completed and signed.
A fresh round of talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban is expected to take place on February 25 in Doha, two senior Taliban sources said.
While he has not been directly involved up until now, Ghani's role is likely to grow as a full deal gets closer and diplomacy intensifies.
Without going into detail on Saturday night, Khalilzad said in tweets that nothing could be agreed without an intra-Afghan dialogue and a full ceasefire.
""He (Khalilzad) will inform Ghani and his officials about all the developments, seek their opinion before traveling back to Washington,"" a senior Afghan official said on conditions of anonymity.
Khalilzad is also due to brief top regional diplomats on Monday morning.
GHANI'S OPTIONS
Western diplomats describe Ghani as being in a tight spot, with no authority to decide on the troop departure and the final decision to declare the ceasefire resting with the Taliban.
He, however does enjoy the power to decide to support an interim government rather than push for presidential elections which could prove to be a distraction to the peace effort.
So far he has rejected talk of an interim government. ""It is time for Ghani to choose between elections or peace process,"" said a western diplomat based in Kabul.
Despite the progress on a pact, violence is widely expected to continue, with the Taliban mounting daily attacks against the Afghan government and its security forces.
The Taliban now control about half of Afghanistan's territory and Ghani said in Switzerland last week that 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he took office in 2014.
A former Taliban leader said despite a agreement for an 18-month withdrawal, he predicted intense fighting ahead. 

""I think Taliban won't stop their fight until they get 100 percent sure that foreign forces are leaving Afghanistan,"" said Sayed Mohammad Akbar Agha, who heads Ways to Save Afghanistan, an independent group run by tribal elders and religious scholars working toward securing peace.

The Sunday Times cited unnamed officials as saying the government had been examining the powers at its disposal if a no-deal Brexit resulted in civil disobedience, including martial law, curfews, and the use of the army to quell rioting.
Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr, if the government was considering the possibility of martial law, Hancock said ""Not specifically, no."" 
Hancock then added: ""It remains on the statute book but it isn't the focus of our attention.""

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines vowed to destroy those behind twin bombings that killed 20 people during a Sunday church service in the country's restive south, six days after a referendum on autonomy for the mainly Muslim region returned an overwhelming ""yes"" vote.
The attack wounded 81 and was one of the deadliest in recent years in a region long plagued by instability. It came amid hope and excitement about the ratification of a devolution plan that aims to bring development, jobs and peace to one of Asia's poorest and most volatile places. 
The first explosion went off inside the cathedral on Jolo island, in Sulu province, and was followed by a second blast outside, which was detonated as security forces raced to the scene, officials said.
""The enemies of the state have boldly challenged the capability of the government to secure the safety of the citizenry in that region,"" said Salvador Panelo, spokesman of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
""The armed forces of the Philippines will rise to the challenge and crush these godless criminals.""
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but police suspect the bombings were the work of Abu Sayyaf, a militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and is notorious for its bombings and brutality.
""They want to show force and sow chaos,"" national police chief Oscar Albayalde told DZMM radio, suggesting Abu Sayyaf was the prime suspect.
Jolo is a stronghold of the group, which runs a lucrative piracy and kidnapping operation that successive governments have failed to break up. The group, which operates in the waters and islands of western Mindanao, has beheaded numerous foreign captives when ransom demands were not met.
Pictures distributed by the military of the inside of the Jolo church showed several rows of wooden pews destroyed, with debris strewn across a blackened floor.
'DASTARDLY ACT'
The attack followed Friday's announcement that the region, a mainly Muslim part of the predominantly Catholic Philippines, had ratified the creation of an autonomous area called Bangsamoro, with 85 percent of voters behind it.
Although Sulu was among only a few areas that rejected autonomy, it will still be part of the new entity when it is fully formed in 2022.
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana called the attack a ""dastardly act"" and urged the local population to cooperate and ""deny terrorism any victory"".
National Security Adviser, Hermogenes Esperon, called those responsible ""mass murderers"" and ""extremist criminals"".
""We will not allow them to spoil the preference of the people for peace,"" he added.
Civilians bore the brunt of the attack, which also killed five soldiers. Police lowered the death toll from 27 to 20, after discovering duplications in initial records. 
The referendum came amid concerns about the presence of extremists in the Philippines and the possibility that foreign radicals will join those of Indonesia and Malaysia in gravitating to Mindanao to capitalize on porous borders, jungles and mountains, and an abundance of arms. 

The Philippine military in mid-2017 encountered its biggest and longest battle since World War Two when an alliance of extremists loyal to Islamic State, among them foreigners and children, overran Marawi City and tried to establish a caliphate.

He wished Emma Fairweather a ""speedy recovery from a very distressing experience"" in the letter, dated Jan. 21 and published by the Sunday Mirror newspaper.
The apology, which was signed ""Yours sincerely, Philip,"" came after the Royal Family was widely criticized over its response to the accident. Philip also received a warning from police for driving without a seatbelt two days after the crash.
Philip escaped without injury when the Land Rover he was driving flipped over following a collision with a Kia car carrying Fairweather on Jan. 17 close to the royals' Sandringham residence in Norfolk, eastern England.
Fairweather, 46, broke her wrist in the accident, and the driver of the Kia, which was carrying a nine-month-baby, suffered cuts to her knee.
""I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley cross-roads,"" Philip said in the letter.
Philip suggested that the sun shining low over the main road played a part in the accident.
""In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming from the Dersingham direction, but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences,"" he said.
Philip said he was ""somewhat shaken"" after the crash and was greatly relieved that there were no serious injuries. He said he was advised to return to Sandringham by a police officer, and only subsequently learned of Fairweather's injury.
""I ma deeply sorry about this injury"" he said.
Fairweather said the letter was a ""nice touch"". 

""It is a difficult letter to write – to know what would be the right thing to say without making me more upset,"" she told the newspaper.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir does little to hide his contempt for the young men and women who have been protesting for more than a month to demand an end to his three-decade rule.
Addressing soldiers this month, Bashir, a 75-year-old former paratrooper who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, warned the ""rats to go back to their holes"" and said he would only move aside for another army officer, or at the ballot box.
""They said they want the army to take power. That's no problem. If someone comes in wearing khaki, we have no objection,"" Bashir, wearing his military uniform, told soldiers at a base in Atbara, the northern Sudanese city where the protests started.
""When the army moves, it doesn't move in a vacuum. It doesn't move in support of traitors. It moves in support of the homeland,"" he added in colloquial Arabic.
Bashir has long been a divisive figure.
Since taking office in what was then Africa's largest country, he fought a protracted civil war with southern rebels which ultimately ended with the secession of South Sudan in 2011, and the loss of more than 70 percent of Sudan's oil.
Sudan has suffered prolonged periods of isolation since 1993, when the United States added Bashir's government to its list of terrorism sponsors for harboring Islamist militants. Washington followed up with sanctions four years later.
Bashir has also been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over allegations of genocide in Sudan's Darfur region during an insurgency that began in 2003.
Now, he is facing almost daily defiance at home in towns and cities across the country, protests that are still spreading despite mass arrests and a harsh crackdown by security forces using tear gas and live ammunition.
Authorities say at least 30 people have died in the unrest, which started on Dec. 19 after the government tried to raise bread prices, while rights groups and local opposition figures say at least 45 have been killed. Hundreds have been injured and hundreds more detained.
""The current protests represent the biggest and deepest challenge to Bashir's rule because they indicate that the crisis has reached a new level,"" analyst Khalid al-Tijani said.
ECONOMIC MELTDOWN
Bashir's critics blame him for Sudan's marginalization and an economic meltdown that saw inflation soar to 72 percent by the end of 2018 and left the country unable to pay for food imports.
Supporters blame a Western conspiracy designed to undermine Islamist rule in Sudan, just as Bashir rejected the ICC charges over Darfur as part of a neo-colonialist plot.
In the months before the protests began, Sudanese had already been struggling to makes ends meet. The government tried to introduce reforms, devaluing the Sudanese pound and relaxing import restrictions, all to little effect.
The government had hoped for quick financial support from wealthy Gulf Arab allies after Bashir sent troops to Yemen as part of a Saudi-led alliance fighting rebels aligned with Iran, but help was slow to arrive.
The trigger for the wave of protests was a government attempt to introduce unsubsidized bread, allowing bakeries to sell at a higher price. That came on top of the crippling, drawn-out crisis that had led to fuel and banknote shortages.
The demonstrations quickly turned political, targeting ruling party offices and demanding Bashir step down.
Unlike previous bouts of unrest, the protests have spread to parts of the country normally loyal to Bashir - and the heavy-handed response has so far failed to stem the spread.
Security forces have mostly used tear gas and stun grenades to try to quash the protests, but demonstrators and local rights groups have also documented the use of live ammunition. 
Protesters often repeat one chant: ""Down, that's it."" Others shout, ""Down, down with Keezan,"" a derogatory name used to describe Islamists.
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Bashir was born on Jan. 1, 1944 to a poor farming family in Hosh Bannaga, a small village consisting mainly of mud houses and dusty streets on the eastern bank of the Nile River, some 150 km (93 miles) north of the capital Khartoum.
He has often played up his humble beginnings. Earlier this month, he repeated a story he told in 2013 of how he broke a tooth while carrying concrete at a construction site where he worked as a student to pay for his education.
Bashir said he refused a silver tooth implant when he joined the military because he wanted to remember that incident whenever he looked in the mirror.
After graduating from Sudan's military academy in 1967, Bashir served in the Sudanese contingent despatched to Egypt to help in the war of attrition against Israel that began following the Six Day War in 1967.
As a young officer in the parachute regiment, he joined the armed wing of the Islamist Movement, which broke away from the Muslim Brotherhood and has ruled Sudan since Bashir took office.
The head of the junta that seized power in 1989, Bashir dissolved the military council in 1993 and has since ruled with an iron fist, accused by rights groups of violence and torture to get rid of his political opponents.
DARFUR LEGACY
But it was Bashir's response to the insurgency in the western Darfur region that has come to define his legacy.
Facing an ICC arrest warrant over the death of an estimated 300,000 people in Darfur, Bashir has focused on his survival, holding on to power as a shield against a trial similar to that of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Defying the ICC, Bashir continued to visit friendly foreign states as he tried to demonstrate he had not been cowed by the international arrest warrant issued by the court.
Bashir has sought to play on regional and international differences to improve Sudan's standing. In 2013, he hosted then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad in Khartoum.
Two years later, Bashir joined a Saudi-led alliance that had intervened in Yemen's civil war as part of a strategy to contain Iran's expanding influence.
Bashir has also courted Turkey and Russia, at the same time as Khartoum stepped up security cooperation with Washington - hoping to speed up the country's emergence from decades of U.S. sanctions that were lifted in 2017.
Now, facing the most sustained challenge to his rule yet, Bashir will be counting on steadfast support from the security establishment he has nurtured for 30 years to see him through. 

""We say to the youth, this country is yours, protect it, and if it goes up in smoke we won't be refugees, we will die here,"" he said this month, dressed in white robes and waving his trademark cane.

A cluster of tiny, dark caverns that modestly commemorates one of the greatest horrors of modern times.
The Chamber of the Holocaust, a six-room cellar whose walls are covered with gravestones, sits beside a tomb some believe to be the burial place of the biblical King David and next to the site where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus held the Last Supper. 
The memorial was established in 1949, four years after the end of World War Two and a year after Israel was founded, as Holocaust survivors who came as refugees to the country sought a place to mourn their families.
""There was no cemetery, no grave. Their families had literally gone up in smoke,"" said Aharon Seiden, the chamber's curator. ""The Chamber of the Holocaust was built as a symbolic cemetery, as a place for Holocaust survivors to come and cry and mourn for their families.""
Ashes of victims were interred there and the hundreds of gravestones that cover the walls commemorate the Jewish villages and towns whose communities were wiped out by the Nazis.
In stark contrast to Israel's official Holocaust memorial - the massive Yad Vashem complex, the Holocaust Chamber is funded largely by private donations and is far less known to Israelis and tourists alike. 
It displays artefacts brought from Europe by survivors such as scorched Torah scrolls, a jacket and drum the Nazis had Jewish prisoners make out of Torah parchments and the striped prisoner uniforms worn in concentration camps.

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Chinese-born Australian writer detained by authorities in Beijing for suspected espionage has long been a divisive figure among overseas Chinese dissidents and activists.
To his supporters, Yang Hengjun is a dedicated democracy activist who believed that China's autocratic system would, with time, necessarily liberalize. His detractors say he had long since abandoned criticizing the ruling Chinese Communist Party in favor of protecting his personal and business interests.
Yang, 53, whose legal name is Yang Jun, was detained in southern China's Guangzhou while waiting for a transfer to Shanghai earlier this month, after flying in from New York.
He was taken to Beijing, where China has said the city's State Security Bureau is holding him under ""coercive measures"", a euphemism for detention, as he is investigated on suspicion of ""endangering state security"".
Yang's lawyer, Mo Shaoping, told Reuters his client was suspected of ""espionage"", and was being held under ""residential surveillance at a designated location"", a special detention measure that allows authorities to interrogate suspects without necessarily granting access to legal representation.
Although his recent writing has mostly avoid Chinese politics, Yang first became prominent in the early 2000s when he earned the nickname of ""democracy peddler"".
Before censorship of China's microblogs intensified, Yang's essays on topics ranging from Chinese nationalism to the fate of ethnic minorities in Tibet, made him a popular commentator. He also wrote a trilogy of spy novels set in China.
More recently, Yang had largely steered clear of issues deemed sensitive by the Communist Party, only occasionally writing about U.S. politics, and instead had thrown his energy into a ""daigou"" business, procuring overseas products for Chinese buyers.
His store on China's popular mobile platform WeChat sold U.S.-made luxury bags, vitamins, baby formula and watches. 
An employee of the store, who declined to be named, said that Yang started the store at the request of his readers, who wanted to buy real and fairly priced goods. Asked what would happen to the store now, he said he was waiting for instructions.
""KEEPS TO HIMSELF""
For the last two years, Yang, who friends describe as an affable, jocular but academic figure, had been living in New York as a visiting scholar at Columbia University.
""He was quite aloof from politics and tended to keep his personal news to himself,"" Yang's former landlord, New York-based businessman Yi Gai, told Reuters. 
""About 75 percent of his energy and time was spent on his daigou work,"" added Yi, who is also a friend of Yang's.
Another friend, who hadn't spoken to Yang in several months, said the Australian writer believed his views were not a challenge to China's rulers.
""He played within the system. He had never called for the bottom to rise up. He wants reform only,"" said the friend, who declined to be named for fear for his safety.
Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, who was himself detained during a 2017 visit to China, said he believed Yang's detention was related to his international connections.
Tensions have risen in recent weeks between China and some Western countries after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Those arrests were widely seen in the West as retaliation by China for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei Technologies executive, on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Australian officials have called on China to handle the matter ""transparently and fairly"", but have downplayed the connection between Yang's case and those of the Canadians.
""He is well-connected in China and internationally. He knows high-profile people in the Communist Party and he believed that meant he could travel to China with relative impunity,"" Feng said. 
POOR BACKGROUND
Yang came from a poor background in China, but studied political economy at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University, according to his own accounts of his time there.
Yang had often told friends that, before his writing career, he worked for China's Foreign Ministry. But ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told Reuters that Yang had never been employed there.
He would also tell friends that he knew Wang Huning, the Chinese Communist Party's chief of ideology, while at Fudan, according to two sources.
Friends say he became an Australian citizen in the early 2000s.
Xia Yeliang, a former professor at Peking University who now lives in Virginia, said Yang was a controversial figure among China's overseas dissident community.
Yang was believed in recent years to have married a well-known nationalist blogger, Yuan Ruijuan, souring his reputation among overseas democracy activists, Xia told Reuters by phone.
At times Yang had said his spy novels, which were serialized on his website, were based on his abundant personal experience within the Chinese system, Xia added.
The novels pit China's spy agency against the CIA and FBI and include double-agents, clones, and a main character who, like Yang, wrote fictional spy novels and attended Fudan University. 
Yi, the landlord and friend, said Yang ""was not willing to keep in close contact with radical dissidents, and definitely wouldn't cooperate with them, so it's natural that radical dissidents would be suspicious and speculate about him"".
Before Yang left for China this month, Yi and some friends met him and the topic of his security came up, but everyone thought he would be fine.

""It looks like we misjudged,"" he said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - In an unprecedented move, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday said he had fired his ambassador to China, who prompted a political furor with comments about Huawei's high-profile extradition case.
John McCallum had embarrassed Trudeau's Liberal government by saying Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States.
Opposition legislators and former ambassadors accused McCallum of unacceptable political interference in an affair which has badly damaged relations between Canada and China.
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver last month over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drugs smuggling and sentenced him to death.
""Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China,"" Trudeau said in a statement that did not explain his reasons.
Veteran diplomats and experts told Reuters it was the first time a Canadian ambassador had ever been officially fired.
Trudeau said as recently as Thursday that he had no plans to replace McCallum, who apologized the same day for his remarks earlier in the week.
But the Toronto Star newspaper on Friday quoted the envoy as saying that if Washington dropped the extradition request ""that would be great for Canada"". McCallum, 68, a long-time former Liberal cabinet minister, is not a trained diplomat.
Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said McCallum's comments on Meng possibly avoiding extradition had signaled to Beijing that its hard line tactics were working.
""He really made it untenable for the prime minister to sustain him (in his post) for any length of time and he had to go,"" Burton said by telephone, suggesting Trudeau should quickly appoint a special envoy to handle the dispute.
Spokespeople for Trudeau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declined to comment when asked about the dismissal.
Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, said in a tweet that Trudeau ""should have fired his ambassador the moment he interfered in this case"" and accused the prime minister of weakness and indecision.

Polls show the Liberals have a slender lead over the Conservatives ahead of a federal election this October.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's top military envoy to the United States defected from the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, as the South American nation said the two countries had scaled back their diplomatic missions to skeleton staff.
The diplomatic friction and defection was triggered by U.S. recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. Washington, Canada and most Latin American nations said Maduro's second-term election win was fraudulent. 
""Today I speak to the people of Venezuela, and especially to my brothers in the armed forces of the nation, to recognize President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president,"" Colonel Jose Luis Silva said in a video recorded at the embassy in Washington, seated at a desk alongside the Venezuelan flag.
Silva told Reuters in Washington that one consular official in Houston and one in another U.S. city also recognized Guaido, but that he was the only diplomat in Washington he knew of who had taken the step. Reuters was not able to independently confirm other defectors.
""The top brass of the military and the executive branch are holding the armed forces hostage. There are many, many who are unhappy,"" Silva said. ""My message to the armed forces is, 'Don't mistreat your people.' We were given arms to defend the sovereignty of our nation. They never, never trained us to say, 'This is for you to attack your people, to defend the current government in power."" 
While small rebellions against Maduro have broken out in Venezuela's armed forces in recent months, there has been no large scale military uprising against him.
Guaido welcomed Silva in a message on Twitter and encouraged others to follow his example. In a tweet, Venezuela's Defense Ministry called Silva a coward, posting a picture of him emblazoned with the word ""traitor"" across it in red capital letters.
U.S. National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis called the defection an example of the principle ""that the role of the military is to protect constitutional order, not to sustain dictators and repress its own people. Encourage others to do the same."" 
A 72-hour deadline issued by Maduro for U.S. embassy personnel to leave Caracas expired on Saturday, after the embattled socialist leader broke off bilateral relations on Wednesday.
Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said in a statement.
However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday.
Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with ""Interest Offices"" in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. For decades, diplomacy between Cuba and the United States was represented by an interest section. 
If the two sides fail to reach an agreement, the remaining diplomatic staff will have to leave and the missions will close. 
(We would) ""maintain an Interests Office, with minimum personnel, and office of representation of interests as functioned in Cuba. That is true diplomacy,"" Maduro said in a live broadcast with Venezuelan youth.
""We don't want to be a North American colony,"" he sang during the broadcast, during which he also pounded conga drums. 
For now, the remaining staff can only carry out their activities within the diplomatic missions, the statement said. 

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the embassy in Caracas.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 09:35PM ET</span>",U.S. calls on world to 'pick a side' on Venezuela; Europeans set to recognize Guaido,"By Michelle Nichols and Mayela Armas
UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday called on the world to ""pick a side"" on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro's government, while European powers signaled they were set to follow Washington in recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's rightful leader.
In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans' demand that elections be called within eight days.
Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognized the young leader in quick succession. Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down.
But on Saturday Guaido, 35, gained support from a key military official. Venezuela's defense attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognized Guaido as interim president. 
Speaking at the U.N. meeting, called by the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro's ""socialist experiment"" had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food.
""Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side. ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you're in league with Maduro and his mayhem,"" Pompeo told the council. ""We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela's democratic transition and interim President Guaido's role.""
Pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro's government. Washington has signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans.
By overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said.
Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognize Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was ""absurd"" and the Venezuelan foreign minister called ""childlike.""
""Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?"" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council. 
Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump's government was still on the table despite his administration's two-year campaign against Maduro.
""If President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won't get that war in Venezuela,"" Arreaza told reporters later.
'FULL SUPPORT' 
Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year.
Maduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote buying. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognize the result of the ballot.
Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 10. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Maduro to step down.
Guaido's declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognized abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions.
After the Security Council debate, Guaido sent a letter to Secretary General Antonio Guterres asking the United Nations for help addressing hunger, violence and the lack of medicines in his country. 
The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.
Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. ""We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,"" Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas.
""Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid. ... We continue adding countries to this great effort,"" he said.
The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions.
After Washington's declaration of support for Guaido, Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country. 
Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said in a statement
However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday.

Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with ""Interest Offices"" in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. If that fails, the missions would close.

Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a conservative from Bavaria, the home state of carmakers Daimler and Audi, a unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said he opposed setting speed limits on Germany's decades-old motorway network.
""The principle of freedom has proven itself. Whoever wants to drive 120 can drive 120, and those who want to go faster can do that too. Why this constant micromanagement?"" he told the newspaper.
Scheuer said German highways were the safest in the world, and that imposing a speed limit would cut the country's overall carbon emissions by less than 0.5 percent. 
He said 7,640 km (4,747 miles) of German highways - about 30 percent of the total - already had speed limits, and that he plans to meet with the committee to discuss its proposals, which are to be finalised by the end of March.
""The goal is to think about the work they're doing and to generate results, instead of revisiting old, rejected and unrealistic demands like speed limits,"" he said.
Germany could be hit with heavy EU fines if it fails to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and poisonous nitrogen oxides. Transport emissions, which have not fallen since 1990, are a particular target for reductions.
The government is torn between the need to protect Germany's crucial car industry, buffeted by a series of costly emissions cheating scandals in recent years, and the need to cut greenhouse gases to meet EU and domestic climate goals.
Imposing a motorway speed limit of 130 kph, fuel tax hikes, and quotas for electric and hybrid car sales, along with ending tax breaks for diesel cars, could generate half the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed, the committee said in a paper reported by Reuters this month.

The committee's findings are to be incorporated into a climate change law the government wants to enact this year.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>","Hezbollah could 'for years' enter Israel, group's leader says after tunnels found","By Laila Bassam and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran-backed Hezbollah has ""for years"" been able to enter Israel, the Lebanese group's leader said on Saturday, responding for the first time to Israel's discovery of tunnels dug into Israeli territory from Lebanon. 
Israel's unveiling of what it called Hezbollah ""attack tunnels"" last month, and Lebanon's accusation that an Israeli border barrier crosses into its territory, have increased tensions. 
Israel regards Iran as its biggest foe and Hezbollah as the main threat on its borders. It has waged an increasingly open campaign of military strikes against them both in Syria, where they are fighting on the government side in the civil war.
Speaking in an interview with al-Mayadeen TV, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah did not want to draw Lebanon into a war with Israel. 
But he said there was a fear that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might miscalculate before the Israeli elections in April and ""do something rash"".
He warned that the ""resistance axis"", as the group refers to itself, Iran and Syria, might change their reaction to Israeli strikes in Syria, including with a bombardment of Tel Aviv. 
Both Israel and Hezbollah have already indicated that any new war between them would be greater in scope than the last one, fought in 2006 in Lebanese territory.
""Part of our plan in the next war is to enter into Galilee, a part of our plan we are capable of, God willing. The important thing is that we have this capability and we have had it for years,"" Nasrallah said. 
He added that all of Israel would be the battlefield and reiterated that the group now had precision rockets that could strike deep into Israel. 
VIOLATIONS
Nasrallah stopped short of explicitly saying the tunnels were Hezbollah's work, citing the heavily armed group's policy of ""ambiguity"" on military matters and a desire to deny Israel a pretext to attack. 
He said Israel was still looking for more tunnels, despite having said its operation to find them was over. He said Israel had only discovered some tunnels, adding ""it is not known"" if more exist.
This week the U.N. Middle East envoy said that at least two of the tunnels found by Israel crossed the ""blue line"" between the countries, ""and thereby constituted violations"". 
U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, said both sides must stick to their side of the blue line and that Hezbollah must leave the area around the frontier. 
The blue line is a decades-old demarcation line that both sides have agreed to abide by until they can agree on a formal delineation of the disputed border. 
The envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, told the United Nations that peacekeepers had not been granted access to the Lebanese entry point of one of the tunnels. 
Nasrallah indicated the tunnels had been dug long ago and that it was ""a surprise"" Israel took so long to locate them. 

""One of the tunnels discovered goes back 13 years,"" he said, asserting it predated resolution 1701, but without discussing how old other tunnels were.

Lebanon's rival parties have been negotiating to form a new government since a May 6 election, adding to concerns of a looming crisis for the country's heavily indebted, stagnant economy. 
""The two obstacles still exist, but during the past few days and last night and today an extraordinary effort was made and there is an effort to find a solution,"" said Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an interview on al-Mayadeen TV. 
""Will it reach a conclusion or not? This needs a prayer,"" he added. 
This week Prime Minister designate Saad al-Hariri said after meeting other senior political figures that matters were ""positively crystallizing"" and he hoped to resolve the issue next week. 
The heavily armed Hezbollah is Lebanon's most powerful political force. The most recent snag in government formation talks has been the difficulty of finding a Cabinet place for a group of six Sunni members of parliament who Hezbollah supports. 
Hezbollah was part of the previous government under Hariri. He has been tasked with forming another coalition government and the existing Cabinet has continued to operate in a caretaker capacity. 
The credit ratings agency Moody's this week downgraded Lebanon's sovereign debt, citing the uncertain movement toward forming a government, and Lebanese bonds have suffered in recent weeks. 
Lebanon is one of the world's most indebted countries and its finance minister has warned it is already in an economic crisis, which has started to turn into a financial crisis and which he hopes will not become a monetary crisis.

The delegation led by European Member of Parliament Ramon Jauregui, a Socialist from Spain who fought alongside Ortega's Sandinistas to overthrow dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, told a news conference it would ask the European Parliament to issue a new resolution on the crisis.
For months, Nicaragua has been convulsed by some of its worst political tension since a civil war in the 1980s. An initial stand-off between protesters and the government in April over planned welfare cuts quickly descended into deadly clashes. 
By the time the Ortega administration had clamped down on the protesters, more than 300 people had been killed and over 500 incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, a group the government has blacklisted.
Rights groups say four radio stations and one TV station have closed, and dozens of journalists have been beaten. The Ortega government says there is freedom of expression and has accused the opposition of seeking to mount a coup to oust him.
""We don't believe the government's story of a coup d'état,"" Jauregui said. ""The repression of protests was excessive. The population is demanding more freedom and democracy. Nicaragua is going through a major crisis of democracy and the rule of law.""
The Nicaraguan government did not respond to a request from Reuters on the allegations made by the delegation.
The European members of parliament said the Ortega government allowed them to hold meetings with all sectors of society, including political prisoners. But they noted that several opposition leaders suffered persecution after they had taken part in the meetings.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria said on Saturday it was ready to revive a landmark security deal with Turkey that normalized ties for two decades before the 2011 conflict if Ankara pulled its troops out of the war-torn country and stopped backing rebels.
In a foreign ministry statement, Syria said it was committed to the 1998 Adana accord, which forced Damascus to stop harboring the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged an armed insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.
""Syria remains committed to this accord and all the agreements relating to fighting terror in all its forms by the two countries,"" said a foreign ministry statement released on state media. 
Damascus, however, said reviving the Adana deal, which Russian President Vladimir Putin raised during his summit meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan last week, depended on Ankara ending its backing of rebels seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar al Assad and pulling its troops out of northwestern Syria.
Turkey has carved a sphere of influence in an opposition-held enclave in northwestern Syria around Idlib province with the help of mainstream Arab rebels who it backs. Its troops monitor a buffer zone in the province under a deal with Russia and Iran.
Western diplomatic sources say the timing of Putin's proposal to revive the Adana deal signaled a move to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's recent call to set up a safe zone along the border inside Syria to support the Kurds. 
Syria did not mention how it would deal with the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara says is an extension of the PKK.
The YPG has during the conflict established a Kurdish-led authority that runs much of northern and eastern Syria and which governs millions of ethnic Arabs in former Islamic State territory where most of Syria's oil wealth lies.
The YPG have engaged in dialogue with government officials to safeguard their autonomous region when U.S. troops that back them pull out.
In a speech on Friday, Erdogan, who has long called for the ousting of President Bashar al Assad and whose country hosts millions of Syrians who fled the war, did not disavow the Adana agreement, saying it gave Turkey the right to enter Syrian territory when it faces threats.

Turkey, which has a large Kurdish population, sees Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria as a threat to its national security. It has repeatedly said it would not wait indefinitely to push out the YPG and that only it can establish the safe zone along its borders with Syria.

The Sphinx International Airport, located near the Giza Pyramids and the new Grand Egyptian Museum, is expected to operate 30 flights by early February during its trial run.
The $17 million project comes as part of the Tourism Ministry's plan to improve accessibility to historical sites from resort areas on the Red sea like Sharm el Sheikh and Hurghada. It will fully open in 2020.
The bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015 hit tourism numbers hard, continuing a downward trend that started with the years of turmoil following the ""Arab Spring"" protests of 2011.
Tourism revenues had begun to rebound, jumping 77 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2018 to $4.8 billion, before a deadly attack on a bus in December killed three Vietnamese tourists and their Egyptian guide.

The bus attack was the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for over a year.

Joel Voordewind, a member of the Dutch parliament, said in a tweet that Mulook planned to return to Pakistan to defend Asia Bibi in a new hearing in her case.
Voordewind posted a picture of himself and Mulook at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport adding that Mulook was ""hopeful"" this would be the last hearing in Bibi's case.
Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 over allegations that she made derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
She was initially sentenced to death but was acquitted by Pakistan's Supreme Court last October and freed.

The court is expected to hear a petition against that ruling next week.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 03:06PM ET</span>",Rwandan opposition figure says she won't be deterred by detention,"By Clement Uwiringiyimana
KIGALI (Reuters) - Diane Rwigara says she will not let more than a year in detention derail her campaign against President Paul Kagame, the rebel-turned-statesman lauded for transforming the small African nation's economy but criticized for smothering dissent.
The 37-year-old accountant tried to run against Kagame in a 2017 election, in which he won a third seven-year term. But she was barred by an electoral commission and detained on charges including forging documents associated with that bid.
""Before going to prison, I had founded a movement called Movement for People’s Salvation-Itabaza and my plan is to continue with it,"" she said in her first interview since being acquitted in December of inciting insurrection and forgery.
""I want it to be the channel through which Rwandan voices can be heard,"" she told Reuters in her family home in Kigali.
""I want it to be the platform where we can hold this government accountable,"" said Rwigara, who was freed on bail in October and acquitted along with her mother in court in December. Both had denied the charges.
Rwigara, who was told by the electoral commission she had not gathered enough supporting signatures to run for president, has repeatedly accused Kagame of stifling dissent, accusations the president and his government dismiss.
Rwigara is not alone in having a presidential bid derailed by legal wrangles. Victoire Ingabire, leader of the unregistered FDU-Inkingi party, tried to run in 2010 but was barred and arrested and then jailed in 2012. She was freed by presidential pardon last year.
""We should not be jailed for having an opinion. I think the change is possible but we cannot wait for pressure to come from abroad,"" Rwigara said.
She has also criticized Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front for its near total hold on power since it marched into Kigali in 1994, ending a genocide in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered.
""The party in power and its chairman President Paul Kagame have to understand ... this country does not belong to one man or one family or a small clique of powerful people,"" she said.
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups have long criticized the government for squeezing out opponents. Rwanda has only one registered opposition party, which is tiny and has only two seats in the 80-seat parliament.
Kagame has dismissed criticism, saying his government guarantees free speech and fair elections. 
He says the overwhelming majorities he has secured at the ballot box reflect broad support for his efforts to rebuild a nation, which has been hailed by Western governments in the past as a model for development.
Olivier Nduhungirehe, a minister of state for foreign affairs, told Reuters Rwigara's comments were ""populist"" and said Rwandans had chosen the leader they wanted to run the nation of 12 million people.
""Only the people through elections can decide who runs the country, it's not up to Diane Rwigara to decide,"" he said.

The work, one of a series of murals painted last June in the French capital and attributed to Banksy, showed a veiled female figure in a mournful pose.
""We are today filled with a deep sense of indignation. The work of Banksy, a symbol of contemplation belonging to all - residents, Parisians and citizens of the world - has been taken from us,"" the Bataclan said in a Twitter post.
Thieves with a van had stolen the door on which the mural was painted the previous night, a police source told Reuters.
The Bataclan theater was stormed by militants during a rock concert in November 2015, as part of coordinated attacks in and around Paris that caused killed 130 people.
Some of Banksy's works in Paris, which also addressed issues like immigration, were vandalized soon after they were put up, while others were protected by screens.
The murals of Banksy, who keeps his real name secret, have become prized attractions for collectors. A work created last month in an industrial town in Wales, depicting a child enjoying snow that is in fact pollution, was sold for over 100,000 pounds ($132,000).

724,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",French 'yellow vests' defy Macron with fresh protests,"PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of ""yellow vest"" demonstrators marched through Paris and other cities on Saturday on the 11th weekend of action against the government, suggesting President Emmanuel Macron has yet to defuse public opposition to some of his policies.
The protests were mostly peaceful but there were sporadic clashes at the end of the Paris march at Bastille square, and incidents elsewhere around France, with a combined 22,000 people attending as of the early afternoon, the interior ministry said.
The protests - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - began in mid-November over plans to raise fuel taxes before developing into a broader revolt against the government that mobilized tens of thousands each weekend.
Turnout so far was lower than last Saturday, particularly in Paris. However, in a change of approach, some protesters have also called for an evening gathering, dubbed ""Yellow Night"", at Republic square, a common venue for demonstrations in Paris.
In one of several processions in the capital, a few hundred demonstrators walked down the Champs-Elysees, the famous avenue that has been the scene of protests every weekend, and across town to Bastille square.
As in previous weeks, protesters carried French flags and held signs attacking ""King Macron"" as out of touch or calling for referendums tabled by ordinary citizens.
As the march converged on Bastille, small groups of protesters formed makeshift barriers, lit fires and threw projectiles at police, who responded with tear gas and water canon, television footage showed.
Police made 42 arrests in Paris, prefectural authorities said.
But as on the last two Saturdays in the capital, the incidents were minor compared with the violence seen in December - the worst trouble of its kind in decades in Paris.
Elsewhere in France, protesters marched through the eastern city of Strasbourg to the European Parliament. 
In the southwest, marches took place in Bordeaux and Toulouse, which have been focal points of the movement, while there were some confrontations during protests in Marseille and Lyon.
To help quell discontent, Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he promised will lead to measures.
In a sign of divisions within the movement, some ""yellow vests"" have proposed a list of candidates to run in May's election for the European Parliament, a move attacked as a betrayal by other activists.

Those opposed to the movement, meanwhile, are planning a counter-demonstration in Paris on Sunday, mainly to condemn the violence seen during the protests.

The blaze damaged two silos at the Red Sea Mills grains facility, which holds 51,000 tonnes of World Food Programme (WFP) wheat -- enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month in the war-torn country.
""WFP urgently needs to get access ... so we can assess the level of damage and begin transporting the unaffected wheat stocks to areas of Yemen where it is desperately needed,"" country director Stephen Anderson said in a statement on Friday.
The WFP has been unable to access Red Sea Mills on the eastern edges of the city since September due to fighting between the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that controls Hodeidah and other Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition that are massed on the outskirts.
A source in the coalition said the silos were hit by Houthi mortars while a Houthi official told Houthi-run media that the fire was caused by coalition artillery fire.
""The world cannot turn a blind eye to these violations, and the coalition will not tolerate them for much longer,"" the source from the alliance told Reuters on Saturday.
The Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed at U.N.-sponsored talks in December on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah, the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial and aid imports.
The truce has largely held but sporadic clashes intensified on Friday as the United Nations struggled to implement the troop withdrawal, a confidence-building step aimed at paving the way for political talks to end the almost four-year war.
Both sides have accused one another of violating the deal.
The port used to supply food to Yemen's 30 million people became the focus of fighting last year, raising fears that a full-scale assault could cut off supply lines.
""A quarter of a million people are in a catastrophic condition, facing near starvation if assistance doesn't get to them,"" Lise Grande, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, said in Friday's statement. ""This is the first time we are seeing conditions like this. We need this wheat.""
Yemen descended into war after pro-democracy unrest forced late former president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government but the Houthis drove him from power in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene in 2015 to restore his government.

The Houthis say their revolution is against corruption.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A blast near a cinema in the centre of Kenya's capital injured two people on Saturday and police said they suspected it was a homemade bomb. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The incident comes less than two weeks after Islamist militants stormed an upscale hotel in Nairobi, killing 21. That attack was claimed by al Shabaab, a Somali militant group behind a series of attacks in Kenya in recent years. 
""We are suspecting an improvised explosive device,"" Nairobi police commander Philip Ndolo told reporters about Saturday's blast.
A man of Somali appearance had hired a porter to push some luggage at about 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) before leaving the porter at a busy junction saying he had to find his identity card, Ndolo said, adding that the luggage then exploded, injuring the porter and a nearby newspaper vendor.
A Reuters reporter at the scene said there did not appear to be any major damage to surrounding shops. Police has set up a security cordon in the area.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Saturday the Roman Catholic Church was weary and ""wounded by her own sin,"" in an apparent reference to the global sexual abuse crisis.
Francis made the comment in the homily of Mass for priests, nuns, and members of Catholic lay organizations in Panama City's newly renovated cathedral of Santa Maria Antigua, the first in mainland America, which was completed in 1716.
The pope has called a summit of the heads of national Catholic churches at the Vatican from Feb. 21-24 to discuss what is now a global sexual abuse crisis.
The meeting offers a chance for him to respond to criticism from victims of abuse that he has stumbled in his handling of the crisis and has not done enough to make bishops accountable..
In his homily, Francis spoke of ""The weariness of hope (that) comes from seeing a Church wounded by her own sin"" and of a Church ""which so often failed to hear all those cries"".
He used the words ""weary,"" ""wearisome"" or ""weariness"" about 20 times in the homily.
Francis then led an elaborate service in which he consecrated the basilica's new altar, donning a white apron over his vestments as he rubbed it down with holy oil and blessed it with incense. 
Relics of three Latin American saints - Saint Rosa of Lima, Saint Oscar Romero and Saint Martin de Porres - as well as a relic of Saint John Paul II, were installed in the altar.
Romero, a champion of the poor, was killed by a right-wing death squad in San Salvador in 1980 and was made a saint by Pope Francis in 2018.
Last year was an ""annus horribilis"" for the pope, with abuse crises exploding in several countries, particularly Chile and the United States.
Following accusations of a cover up of abuse in Chile, all 34 of the country's bishops offered their resignations. Francis has so far accepted seven of them but has also defrocked two Chilean bishops accused of molesting minors.
Last August, the Church in the United States was rocked by a damning grand jury report on the sexual abuse of children by priests in Pennsylvania over a 70-year period.
Francis has urged predator priests who have sexually abused minors to turn themselves in and has acknowledged that the Church had made serious errors in the past.
Before leaving for Panama, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said a meeting between the pope and victims of clergy abuse was not on the schedule. On past trips, however, such meetings were announced only after they took place.
Francis is in Panama for the Roman Catholic Church's World Youth Day, a global gathering of Catholic youth that takes place in a different city about every three years.

On Saturday night, Francis was due to preside at a prayer vigil with hundreds of thousands of young Catholics who have come to Panama from around the world. He leaves for Rome on Sunday night after a closing outdoor Mass.

The incident followed a confrontation between settlers and Palestinians near the city of Ramallah in which a settler was lightly injured, the military said.
""Initial details suggest that shortly thereafter, a conflict erupted between Israeli civilians and Palestinians in the area, in which live rounds were fired by the civilians. One Palestinian died and several others are injured,"" the military said in a statement, adding that an investigation has begun.
The Palestinians said the settlers had entered the village of al-Mughayer and that its residents tried to fend them off. The Israeli military said its forces dispersed the crowds. The Palestinian Health Ministry said that the man killed was 38 years old and that nine other people were wounded by gunfire.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing.
""The Israeli Government is continuing its policy of escalation,"" Abbas said in a statement published by the official Wafa news agency. ""This will lead to serious consequences, further tension and the creation of a dangerous and uncontrollable atmosphere.""
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014, and a bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to restart negotiations has so far shown little progress. 
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with a capital in east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move unrecognized abroad and in 2005 pulled its settlers and army out of Gaza. It maintains a blockade of the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel and the West.
In the West Bank, the Palestinians have limited self-rule and most of the territory is controlled by Israel. Most countries view the settlements Israel has built there as illegal - a view that Israel disputes, citing biblical, historical and political ties to the land.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Taliban officials said U.S. negotiators on Saturday agreed a draft peace deal stipulating the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan within 18 months of the agreement being signed.
The details were given to Reuters by Taliban sources at the end of six days of talks with U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Qatar aimed at ending the United States' longest war.
While neither side released an official statement, Khalilzad tweeted later that the talks had made ""significant progress"" and would resume shortly, adding that he planned to travel to Afghanistan to meet government officials.
""Meetings here (in Qatar) were more productive than they have been in the past. We have made significant progress on vital issues,"" he wrote, adding that numerous issues still needed work.
""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and everything must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive ceasefire,"" he said in the tweets.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined further comment.
It was not clear if the draft described by the Taliban sources is acceptable to both sides or when it will be completed and signed.
According to the sources, the hardline Islamic group gave assurances that Afghanistan will not be allowed to be used by al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants to attack the United States and its allies -- a key early demand of Washington.
They said the deal included a ceasefire provision but they had yet to confirm a timeline and would only open talks with Afghan representatives once a truce was implemented.
Up until now, the Taliban has repeatedly rejected the Afghan government's offer of holding talks, preferring instead to talk directly to the U.S. side, which it regards as its main enemy.
""In 18 months, if the foreign forces are withdrawn and ceasefire is implemented then other aspects of the peace process can be put into action,"" a Taliban source said, quoting from a portion of the draft.
More talks on the draft are expected in February, again in the Qatari capital Doha, the Taliban sources said.
They expect their side to be led by new political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the movement's co-founder and a former military commander who was released from prison in Pakistan last year.
While they said his appointment had boosted momentum for a deal, it was unclear if he joined the talks.
Taliban officials believe the U.S. was keen to get Baradar -- who was captured in a joint Pakistani-U.S. intelligence raid in 2010 -- to the table so they could be sure of speaking to the movement's most powerful figures.
NEAR-DAILY ATTACKS
Other clauses in the draft include an agreement over the exchange and release of prisoners, the removal of an international travel ban on several Taliban leaders by Washington and the prospect of an interim Afghan government after the ceasefire is struck, the Taliban sources said.
The suggestion to appoint an interim government in Afghanistan comes at a time when top politicians including Ghani have filed their nominations for the presidential polls in July this year. Ghani has repeatedly rejected the offer to agree to the formation of an interim government.
News of progress on a deal comes as the Taliban continues to stage near-daily attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and its security forces.
Despite the presence of U.S.-led foreign forces training, advising and assisting their Afghan counterparts 17 years after the U.S.-led an invasion to drive them from power, the Taliban controls nearly half of Afghanistan.
Ghani said last week that 45,000 members of the country's security forces had been killed since he took office in 2014.
The United States has some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led mission, known as Resolute Support, as well as a U.S. counter-terrorism mission directed at groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaeda.
Despite reports in December last year that the United States was considering pulling out almost half of its forces, a White House spokesman said that U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued orders to withdraw the troops. However, the administration has not denied the reports, which have prompted fears of a fresh refugee crisis.
The Taliban sources also confirmed provisions in the draft that have broader implications for Afghanistan's ties with its neighbors, particularly Pakistan, India and China.
They said the deal included provisions that Baloch separatist militants will not be allowed to use Afghan soil to target Pakistan.

Balochistan, a resource-rich yet often-neglected province in south west Pakistan, has been the source of separatist insurgencies for more than 60 years.

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan police arrested dozens of people in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif including six Turkish teachers in a raid on a school Turkey suspects has links with President Tayyip Erdogan's arch enemy, officials and teachers said.
The raid on Afghan-Turk school on Friday was the latest move against an educational foundation the Ankara government says is connected to Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric it accuses of being behind a coup attempt in 2016.
Shukarullah Samadi, one of the teachers at the school said police had begun their raid at around 2 a.m., arresting six Turkish teachers and at least 40 other teachers and staff members.
""These schools have been successful for 23 years and we're very worried about their future in Afghanistan,"" he said.
Afghan Turk CAG Educational NGO (ATCE), the body that runs the schools, operates schools in several cities including the capital, Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar and Herat and has been in Afghanistan since 1995.
It says it is an independent foundation and has denied any involvement with the 2016 coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Its schools have a good reputation but Ankara, which has major economic interests in northern Afghanistan as well as strong political and cultural links, has put heavy pressure on the Kabul government to turn them over to Turkey.
Last year the government ordered the management of the schools to be transferred in accordance with the wishes of the Turkish government but implementation has been slow. 
Similar schools linked to Gulen's Hizmet movement operate across the world and Turkey has pressed countries where it has influence to transfer their management to the Maarif Foundation, a Turkish educational body.
A statement on the foundation's website on Saturday said it had taken over six out 12 of Gulen's schools in Afghanistan.
Monir Ahmed Farhad, spokesman for the governor of Balkh said the action was taken to enforce the government's decision to transfer management of the school.
""This decision to transfer management of the Turkish Afghan school comes from an agreement between the ministry of education of Afghanistan and Turkey, the local administration in Balkh is just implementing it,"" he said.
Students and teachers at Afghan-Turk school expressed alarm and said they feared a decline in educational standards.
""Our whole concern is that the quality of education at the schools does not go down,"" said Aref Mousavi, the father of a child at the school. ""It's been very good over the years and this should stay the same.""
Since the abortive putsch, Turkey has waged a crackdown on suspected members of Gulen's network. Some 77,000 people have been jailed and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it.

MADRID (Reuters) - Major European countries threw their weight behind Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday saying they would recognize him as interim president if Nicolas Maduro failed to call elections within eight days.
Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognize Guaido unless fresh elections were announced.
Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year.
Maduro cruised to re-election in May last year amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right leaning Latin American governments declined to recognize the result of the vote. 
Guaido proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday though Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. 
Earlier this week, the United States declared support for Guaido, with Vice President Mike Pence calling Maduro ""a dictator with no legitimate claim to power."" Since then, most Latin American nations and Canada have all said they back the 35-year-old opposition leader.
EUROPE JOINS CALL
On Saturday, they were joined by four European Union countries. 
""The government of Spain gives [President] Nicolas Maduro eight days to call free, transparent and democratic elections,"" Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in statement.
""If that doesn't happen, Spain will recognize Juan Guaido as interim president in charge of calling these elections.""
French President Manuel Macron sent a tweet echoing Sanchez's comments almost simultaneously. 
""Unless elections are announced within eight days, we will be ready to recognize @jguaido as 'President in charge' of Venezuela in order to trigger a political process,"" Macron said.
A spokeswoman from the German government tweeted the same message shortly after the comments from Madrid and Paris.
And later British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt made a similar call.
""After banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election it is clear Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela,"" Hunt tweeted.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reiterated Brussels' call for Venezuela to hold free, transparent and credible presidential elections, adding that failure to do so would prompt further action by the EU.
Russia, meanwhile, called for the United States and Europe to cease interfering in Venezuela. 
""The cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state continues. It must stop,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. 

The United States said on Friday it was ready to step up economic measures to drive Maduro from power.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights investigator leading an international inquiry into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi said on Saturday she had made a request to have access to the crime scene in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul and to visit the kingdom.
Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on executions, who begins a week-long mission to Turkey at government invitation on Monday, said she had not yet had a reply from Saudi authorities. 
On Thursday, she said the three-member legal and forensic panel would seek to establish ""states' and individuals' responsibilities"" for the killing.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist living in the United States, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 where he had gone to collect documents for his planned wedding. 
U.S. intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, who was a critic, and say his body was dismembered and removed to a location still publicly unknown.
Riyadh denies the crown prince had any involvement in the murder. 
""I have requested access to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and a meeting with the ambassador of the Kingdom of Saud Arabia in Turkey,"" Callamard said in an email to Reuters. ""I have also sought permission to conduct a similar country-visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."" 
The Saudi mission in Geneva and government media office in Riyadh have not responded to Reuters inquiries about the international investigation.
A Saudi public prosecutor's spokesman said last year that 21 Saudis had been taken into custody over the case, 11 of whom had been indicted and referred to trial. The prosecutor said this month it was seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 indicted suspects. 
""I conceive of this inquiry to be a necessary step, among a number of others, toward crucial truth telling about and formal accountability for the gruesome killing of Mr. Khashoggi,"" Callamard said.
In its report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in June, the inquiry will make recommendations about how to ensure ""formal (criminal) accountability"", she said.
Callamard said she had requested information from other authorities, including in the United States.

""It is hoped this will help ensure accountability and transparency in this case and may open new avenues for the prevention and protection of the right to life in other cases, including of journalists and human rights defenders, and accountability for their killings,"" she added.

The crowd was demonstrating over a recent Turkish air raid that killed four civilians, a Kurdish official in the region of Dohuk said.
Turkey's Defense Ministry wrote on Twitter: ""An attack has occurred on one of bases located in northern Iraq as a result of provocation by the PKK terrorist organization. There was partial damage to vehicles and equipment during the attack.""
Without naming the base, the ministry said ""necessary precautions are being taken regarding the incident.""
Turkish officials could not be reached for further comment. 
Turkey carries out regular air raids near the border against the PKK insurgent group which has bases in northern Iraq and has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.
A second Kurdish official, who also did not give his name, said Turkish troops at the camp in Shiladze, east of Dohuk, had initially shot at the protesters and then left the camp.
Kurdish security forces are trying to control the situation, he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel underscored the urgency of combating anti-Semitism, racism and hatred more than 70 years after the Holocaust, calling for new ways to keep alive the memory of the millions of people killed by the Nazis.
Merkel, in a video address released ahead of Sunday's International Holocaust Remembrance Day, said it was everyone's responsibility to ensure ""zero tolerance"" of xenophobia and all forms of anti-Semitism.
""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" Merkel said.
Millions of people were robbed of their rights, tortured and murdered -- including an estimated six million Jews -- across Europe from 1933 to 1945, when the Nazis ruled Germany.
The German leader called for new forms of remembrance due to the dwindling number of eyewitnesses from the Nazi era, and because of persistent hatred and incitement today.
Merkel expressed deep regret about anti-Semitism among Germans, as well as hatred of Jews among Muslim migrants and a hatred of Israel that she said could not be tolerated.
Germany last year appointed a commissioner to oversee efforts to combat ant-Semitism and will also set up a central repository to collect information about such incidents and attacks, with an eye to bolstering prevention, Merkel said.
""It will be crucial in the coming time to find new ways of remembrance,"" she said. ""We must look more closely at the personalities of people who were victims back then, and to tell their stories.""
Merkel cited the importance of supporting Holocaust memorials and private initiatives such as the ""stumbling stones"" project, which installs brass bricks inscribed with the names and key details of people near the homes from which they were deported during the Nazi era.
""I think these forms of remembrance ... are very important and will become more significant in the future,"" Merkel said.
On Friday, the director of the memorial at the largest Nazi concentration camp on German soil barred the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) from a commemoration for the 56,000 people killed there during the Holocaust.
Volkhard Knigge, director of the Buchenwald Memorials Foundation, told AfD politicians in the state of Thuringia where the camp is located that he was responding to anti-democratic, racist and anti-Semitic tendencies in the party.

The AfD, whose popularity surged amid anger over Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome over a million mostly Muslim migrants, says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, but rejects charges of racism.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's main opposition party has halted its presidential election campaign for 72 hours weeks ahead of the vote in protest at the suspension of the country's most senior judge by President Muhammadu Buhari, it said on Saturday.
The president on Friday said he had suspended chief justice of Nigeria (CJN) Walter Onnoghen who has been asked to appear before a tribunal over allegations of breaching asset-declaration rules. 
Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him.
Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and voted into office in 2015, is seeking a fresh term in the upcoming election. At stake is control of Africa's top crude oil producer and one of the continent's biggest economies.
Nigeria's judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes after past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. The chief justice could preside over a disputed election result.
""In the first instance, we are suspending our campaign for 72 hours. It is our hope that President Buhari will listen to the voice of all lovers of democracy the world over and restore democracy in Nigeria immediately and without qualifications,"" the PDP said in a statement. 
Buhari on Friday said a court order from the Code of Conduct Tribunal, which is looking into the asset declaration allegations, directed him to suspend the judge. 
""We call on all well meaning Nigerians to rise in defense of democracy and save our nation from this imminent slide into tyranny,"" the PDP said in its statement. 
The opposition party, which was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari's 2015 election victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party, said the judge's suspension was a ""brazen assault on the constitution"".
The APC said the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) was set to lose the poll, scheduled to take place on Feb. 16, and its campaign suspension was part of an attempt to provide an ""excuse"" after it has been defeated. 
""It is just an excuse they are looking for in order to escape the defeat that is awaiting them,"" Lanre Issa-Onilu, a spokesman for the ruling APC, said in a telephone interview when asked about the suspension of the opposition's campaign. 
""They have the right to decide to continue with their campaign or not even participate in the election. They know that Nigerians have rejected them because they have failed in the past,"" he said.

The PDP's candidate, businessman Atiku Abubakar who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007, is the main challenger to Buhari in the upcoming poll.

The death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, sparked global outrage and mushroomed into a crisis for the world's top oil exporter and strategic ally of the West.
It also raised questions about Western business activity in the kingdom where BAE, Britain's biggest defense company, and its partners are currently engaged in a multi-billion pound deal to sell Typhoon fighter planes. 
""Saudi Arabia was a country that was developing very well under new leadership - a sense of liberalization, opening up the country, opening up to opportunities for women. All these things were being very well received,"" Chairman Roger Carr told Sky News.
""Two issues damaged the position of Saudi Arabia in eyes of the world - the Khashoggi affair is one of them and also the war in Yemen.""
""On Khashoggi, we have seen that politicians have admonished Saudi Arabia. Politicians didn't believe the way that was done and handled was appropriate or acceptable and that's exactly right,"" he said. 
""What we want to see, by being a consistent and critical friend, is that Saudi Arabia, needs to return to the pathway it was on and develop in the way it was.""
Riyadh is pursuing a plan to diversify the Arab world's largest economy away from reliance on crude revenues, in part by attracting increasing amounts of foreign investment.
Yemen, one of the poorest Arab countries, is locked in a nearly four-year-old war that pits Iran-aligned Houthi rebels against the government backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the West. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

On Yemen, Carr said: ""Our involvement with Saudi Arabia is helping us to take them to a point where a war that is, for them, a defensive war is something that they all recognize as something that needs to be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The date Britain leaves the EU could be pushed back by a couple of weeks to give time for legislation to be approved by lawmakers, the leader of Britain's lower house of parliament said, the most senior figure to make such a suggestion.
Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiated exit deal was rejected by lawmakers, leaving open the possibility of a disorderly Brexit.
Parliament will now vote on a series of amendments on Tuesday with the United Kingdom facing its deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
""We can get the legislation through and I think we do, in spite of everything, have a very strong relationship with our EU friends and neighbors and I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something then that would be feasible,"" Andrea Leadsom told the BBC. 
Responding to the idea that this would mean extending the two-year Article 50 negotiation period, Leadsom, who is the organizer of government business in the lower house of parliament, told the BBC: 
""It doesn't necessarily mean that. I think we would want to think carefully about it. But as things stand I do feel that we can get, with the support of both Houses - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with goodwill and a determination we can still get the legislation through in good time.""
A spokeswoman at May's No. 10 Downing Street office said the government's position had not changed.
""We are not considering an extension to article 50 and are committed to doing whatever it takes to have the statute books ready for when we leave the EU on March 29th this year."" 

The uncertainty has prompted several businesses to warn of the threat to jobs and investment if Britain were to crash out of the EU, potentially disrupting food and medicine supplies, manufacturers and transportation.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban's new political leader is expected to join meetings with U.S. officials in Qatar imminently, Taliban sources said on Saturday as the latest round of talks to find ways to end the 17-year Afghan war entered a sixth day.
The peace talks, initially slated for two days, are continuing despite Taliban representatives staging a brief walkout on Friday over differences with U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.
Two senior Taliban officials in Afghanistan who are privy to the negotiations said momentum was building following Thursday's appointment of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar as the political leader of the hardline Islamist group.
Baradar, released from a prison in Pakistan last year, is expected to fly to Qatar to join the session - a move they believe will be welcomed by a U.S. side keen to talk to senior Taliban figures.
""He is expected to join soon,"" one of the senior Taliban officials in Afghanistan said.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul was not immediately available for comment.
Question marks remain over Baradar's health, with Taliban officials saying after his release in October that Baradar needed rest before joining the movement's leadership council.
Baradar, who earlier led the insurgent group's military operations in southern Afghanistan, was arrested in 2010 by a team from Pakistan and U.S. intelligence agencies.
A co-founder of the movement, he was a close friend of the reclusive former Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, who gave him his nom de guerre, “Baradar” or “brother”. 
His appointment marks a new push to bring Taliban out of the political and diplomatic shadows, with several other officials being appointed to oversee education, mining and health issues.
Staging near daily attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and its security forces, the Taliban controls nearly half of Afghanistan and are widely seen as more powerful than at any time since being toppled in the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.
Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, said last week that 45,000 members of the country’s security forces had been killed since he took office in the fall of 2014. 
When he joins talks, Baradar will be faced with easing U.S. fears over the Taliban's refusal to cut ties with al-Qaeda - the issue at the core of Friday's walkout.
One of the key U.S. demands is a guarantees from the Taliban that Afghanistan would not be used as future base for terrorist attacks against the U.S. and its allies.
""The Taliban has assured the U.S. that they will oppose any attempt by militant groups to use Afghanistan to stage terrorist attacks on America or its allies,"" a senior Taliban leader told Reuters, adding that U.S. wants the Taliban to snap ties with Islamic State and al Qaeda.
""We are willing to denounce links with Islamic State but we refuse to disconnect ties with al-Qaeda because they accept Taliban supremo Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada as their leader too,"" the leader told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.

MANILA (Reuters) - A predominantly Muslim area of the southern Philippines has returned a resounding ""Yes"" in this week's referendum on greater autonomy, boosting hopes for peace in one of Asia's most conflict-torn regions. 
The plan to create a self-administered area for the Muslim-dominated parts of Mindanao was backed by 85 percent of voters, the election commission said late on Friday, paving the way for a three-year transition toward elections for a legislature that will choose an executive. 
Monday's referendum was the culmination of a tumultuous peace process between separatists and successive governments that aimed to settle decades of conflict, which have hampered development and kept these parts of Mindanao among Asia's poorest regions. 
The instability and high rates of unemployed, unschooled youth made the areas fertile recruitment ground for bandits and Islamist extremists, who exploited grievances about neglect and stoked narratives of government duplicity in the peace process. 
The endorsement by some 1.74 million voters comes as no surprise, and the new region to be called Bangsamoro (nation of Moros) will have greater powers to generate and invest more money in infrastructure, schools, healthcare and social welfare for its estimated 5 million inhabitants. 
A ballot will now be held on Feb. 6 to ask several other areas if they want to join. 
The central government will oversee defense, security, and foreign and monetary policy, and soon appoint a transition authority nominated by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). 
(GRAPHIC: Philippine referendum on Muslim autonomous region - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hk3s7L)
Vice President Leni Robredo said it was vital the central government helps Bangsamoro to build ""a progressive economy and responsible local government"". 
""Let us guard and support the progress of this process because this is not yet the end of the fight for peace,"" Robredo said. 
The vote came at a critical time for the Philippines, which saw disillusioned MILF factions break away and follow other armed groups in pledging allegiance to Islamic State. 
That has stoked fears that fighters fleeing Iraq and Syria would join radicals from Malaysia and Indonesia in gravitating to Mindanao to capitalize on porous borders, jungles and mountains, and an abundance of arms. 
Martial law has been in place in Mindanao since an extremist alliance overran Marawi City in 2017 and occupied it for five months, in what was the Philippines' fiercest and longest conflict since World War Two. 
The army said three remnants of that alliance were killed on Thursday when troops discovered a makeshift jungle camp. It released images of trenches and what it said was Islamic State paraphernalia. 
Mohagher Iqbal, the MILF's top peace negotiator, said on TV on Thursday that he hoped radical splinters of the separatist group, like those of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), would recognize the will of the people for peace. 

""One of the BIFF leaders has already reached out,"" he said, without elaborating.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people rallied across Australia on Saturday calling for the abolition of the Jan. 26 national holiday in protests showing a deep division over a festivity intended to celebrate the birth of modern Australia.
While Australia Day marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the ""First Fleet"" of British ships at Sydney Cove, many indigenous Australians, who trace their lineage on the continent back 50,000 years, regard it as ""Invasion Day"".
""Today marks the start of colonization and the start of genocide and you name it,"" said Jayden Riley, 17, who was marching in Sydney in a singlet in the black, yellow, and red colors of the Aboriginal flag.
""It is not about refusing to celebrate being Australian. This day represents more than just being Australian to our people. My Nan's stolen generation, for example, she was taken from her family and brainwashed to be a Catholic - all that sort of stuff, you know.""
At a rally in Sydney stretched along more than half a dozen of city blocks, about 5,000 protesters chanted, ""Always was and always will be aboriginal land"" and ""No pride in genocide."" Protests attended by several thousand people took place in Melbourne, Canberra and other Australian cities.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government, which faces a general election due in May, opposes any change to the holiday. 
Attending official celebrations and a citizenship ceremony in Canberra, Morrison said it is idealism and enlightenment, not cruelty and dispossession that have prevailed in the country. 
""These great ideas are the foundation of our modern Australia, and they have transformed us into this most recent chapter of our great story - the one we write together,"" Morrison told crowds in the capital.
Australia's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
""This country stops for a horse race, it stops for an AFL (Australia Football League) grand final, it stops for the Queen's birthday and it stops for an Anzac service and we don't have ever a time where this country stands still to reflect on first peoples of this country and the pain and suffering we've endured since colonization,"" Lidia Thorpe, an Aboriginal former member of parliament, was quoted as saying by ABC News.
On Saturday, Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion said he was retiring from politics and would not stand in a general election set for May.
""I am grateful that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have welcomed me in every corner of this continent that I have visited, and worked with me in providing local and national solutions,"" Scullion said in a statement posted on his website.

Cuba has found itself in a diplomatic bind since Colombia's President Ivan Duque asked it last week to extradite those leaders following an ELN car bomb blast at a police academy in Bogota that killed 21 people.
The Cuban government condemned the attack but said it would follow the protocols agreed at the start of negotiations in 2017. These provide security guarantees for guerrilla commanders to return to Colombia or Venezuela within 15 days of an end to talks and bar military offensives for 72 hours.
""Cuba's foreign ministry calls on the Colombian government and the ELN to adopt the relevant measures that would allow the proceedings for the return of the ELN delegation in accordance with the protocol,"" it said in a statement.
Duque has said the protocols do not apply since his government never participated in talks started by Former President Juan Manuel Santos. He had refused to restart the negotiations until the ELN freed all hostages and stopped criminal activities.
Though the notoriously decentralized ELN claimed responsibility for the car bombing last week, calling the attack a legitimate attack of war, its leaders in Cuba have said they were not involved.
Some analysts say the Colombian government should be obliged to accept the protocols despite the change of administration.
The Cuban foreign ministry said it had sent a verbal note to its Colombian counterpart recalling the commitments it and the ELN had undertaken, sending a copy of the note to the other countries overseeing the peace talks.
Cuba, which had previously hosted talks between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia that led to a peace agreement in 2016, recalled that it had offered to be the seat of peace talks last year as a ""goodwill gesture"".
The original host Ecuador pulled its support for the talks, saying it would not host them as long as the guerrillas continued to wage attacks.

TIJUANA/MEXICO CITY, Mexico (Reuters) - The United States was expected to send a first group of 20 Central American asylum seekers back to Mexico through the border city of Tijuana on Friday as part of President Donald Trump's hardening of longstanding U.S. immigration policy.
Under a policy dubbed the Migrant Protection Protocols, announced on Dec. 20, the United States will return non-Mexican migrants who cross the U.S. southern border back to Mexico while their asylum requests are processed in U.S. immigration courts.
Mexican Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco said U.S. authorities were expected to send the first group of 20 Central American asylum seekers back to Mexico's territory on Friday through Tijuana, but as of about 7:00 p.m. local time there were no reports of the group crossing the border.
Velasco told local broadcaster Radio Formula that Mexican officials had not yet been given the list of people in the first group, which he said was supposed to be provided Friday morning, adding that he still expected the first transfer in the ""next few hours."" 
He emphasized that the Mexican government would not be providing food or shelter for the returned asylum seekers.
""What we're proposing is that we provide these people with opportunities in the labor market,"" said Velasco, without going into further detail.
Under the policy, U.S. authorities will send as many as 20 people per day through Tijuana and gradually start sending people back through the other legal ports of entry along the Mexican border, Velasco said earlier in the day.
Mexico will accept the return of certain individuals who have a date to appear in a U.S. immigration court, but will reject those who are in danger in Mexican territory, suffering health problems, or are unaccompanied minors.
Velasco previously said that Mexico does not have a ""Safe Third Country Agreement"" with the United States, which would ""imply a binding commitment to process in our territory all U.S. asylum requests of migrants that pass through our country and take full responsibility for their legal situation.""
Asylum seekers have traditionally been granted the right to stay in the United States while their cases were decided by a U.S. immigration judge, but a backlog of more than 800,000 cases means the process can take years. 
Now, the U.S. government says migrants will be turned away with a ""notice to appear"" in immigration court. They will be able to enter the United States for their hearings but will have to live in Mexico in the interim. If they lose their cases, they will be deported to their home countries.
""Shelters are at capacity and we can't receive migrants that are being deported or (Mexican) nationals that are passing through the city. Let's hope this doesn't happen,"" said Jose Maria Garcia, who runs the Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana.
Leopoldo Guerrero, Tijuana's secretary of government, said Mexico's federal government should take responsibility for the migrants, stressing that the city did not have the resources to do so. 
The U.S. policy is aimed at curbing the increasing number of families arriving mostly from Central America to request asylum who say they fear returning home due to threats of violence. The Trump administration says many of the claims are not valid. 
The program will apply to arriving migrants who ask for asylum at ports of entry or who are caught crossing illegally and say they are afraid to return home. 
Immigration advocates fear Mexico is not safe for migrants who are regularly kidnapped by criminal gangs and smugglers, and have raised concerns that applicants will not be able to access proper legal counsel in U.S. courts.
Twenty-four year-old Danis Lazaro, who left his native Guatemala five months ago with his two daughters, aged 6 and 7, said he was concerned about the new U.S. policy.
""It doesn't seem fair to me. It's safer for us on the other side (of the border),"" he said.
It is unclear how Mexico plans to house what could be thousands of asylum seekers during their immigration proceedings. Some Mexican border towns are more violent than the cities the Central Americans left behind.
""For many of them, Mexico is not a safe place to stay,"" said Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. 
Trump's administration, which has described Central American migrants as a danger, says it is relying on a U.S. law that allows migrants attempting to enter the United States from a contiguous country to be removed to that country. 

But the policy will likely be challenged in court since claiming asylum is protected under both international and U.S. law. Several of Trump's signature immigration policies, including some attempting to reduce asylum applications, have been halted by U.S. federal courts.

The comments add to doubts whether the troubled North African oil producer can hold parliamentary or presidential elections by June as sought by the United Nations and Western powers.
""We have repeatedly highlighted the counterproductive character of setting deadlines in Libya,"" Lavrov told reporters after talks in Rabat with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita.
Libyans needed to agree first on the ""rules of the game"" for elections, he added, speaking through a translator.
Under a French plan, Libya was meant to hold national elections on Dec. 10 but the idea was dropped due to a spike in violence in the Tripoli and a lack of progress between rival parliaments in the west and east to find a political solution.
Libya has two governments, the internationally recognized one in Tripoli and a parallel version in the east, a result of conflict going back to the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame said in November he hoped elections would happen by June but so far there is no law or constitutional frame in place for a vote to go ahead.

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian rescuers were searching for some 200 missing people after a tailings dam burst on Friday at an iron ore mine owned by Vale SA, with seven bodies recovered but the death toll expected to rise sharply.
Avimar de Melo Barcelos, the mayor of the town of Brumadinho where the dam burst in Brazil's mining hub of Minas Gerais state, said seven bodies had been recovered by nightfall.
However, Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said only one-third of the roughly 300 workers at the site of the disaster had been accounted for. He said a torrent of sludge tore through the mine's offices, including a cafeteria during lunchtime.
U.S.-listed shares of Vale tumbled as much as 10 percent after the incident, the second major disaster at a Brazilian tailings dam involving Vale in just over three years.
Both hit Minas Gerais, which is still recovering from the collapse of a larger dam in November 2015 that killed 19 people. That dam, owned by a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) called Samarco Mineracao SA, buried a nearby village and devastated a major river with toxic waste in Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
Operations at Samarco remain halted over legal disputes relating to damages even after the companies settled a $5.28 billion civil lawsuit last year.
Schvartsman said the dam that burst on Friday at the Feijao iron mine was being decommissioned and had a capacity of 12 million cubic meters – a fraction of the roughly 60 million cubic meters of toxic waste released by the Samarco dam break.
""The environmental impact should be much less, but the human tragedy is horrible,"" he told journalists at Vale's offices in Rio de Janeiro. He said equipment had shown the dam was stable on Jan. 10 and it was too soon to say why it collapsed.
Fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant Pedro Aihara said the torrent of mud stopped just short of the local Paraopeba river, a tributary of Brazil's longest river, the Sao Francisco.
""Our main worry now is to quickly find out where the missing people are,"" Aihara said on GloboNews cable television channel. Scores of people were trapped in nearby areas flooded by the river of sludge released by the dam failure.
Helicopters plucked people covered in mud from the disaster area, including a woman with a fractured hip who was among eight injured people taken to hospital, officials said.
The Feijao mine is one of four in Vale's Paraoeba complex, which includes two processing plants and produced 26 million tonnes of iron ore in 2017, or about 7 percent of Vale's total output, according to information on the company's website.

Feijao alone produced 7.8 million tonnes of ore in 2017.

WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Friday signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power as some U.S. diplomats left the embassy in Caracas and Russia vowed to back its socialist South American ally.
The U.S. Treasury Department stopped short of announcing a freeze on Venezuela's U.S. assets and accounts, but said it would take steps to ensure commercial transactions were ""consistent"" with its recognition this week of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday will urge members of the United Nations Security Council to recognize Guaido. Washington requested the meeting of the 15-member council after a string of countries threw their weight behind Guaido, who heads Venezuela's congress, and urged Maduro to step down.
Pompeo will be accompanied by former U.S. diplomat Elliott Abrams, who he named on Friday to lead U.S. efforts on Venezuela. Abrams is a neoconservative who has long advocated an activist U.S. role in the world.
Russia opposes the U.S. efforts and has accused Washington of backing a coup attempt, placing Venezuela at the heart of a growing geopolitical duel.
Private military contractors who carry out secret missions for Russia have flown into Venezuela in the past few days to beef up security for Maduro, sources said. 
Maduro said he welcomed the U.N. debate. ""Thanks, Mike,"" he said, tongue in cheek, during a Friday news conference. ""We're going to tell the truth about the articles of the constitution, about the coup.""
Maduro on Wednesday ordered U.S. diplomats out of the country within 72 hours. On Friday, some American diplomats left the U.S. embassy in Caracas in a convoy of vehicles with a police escort en route to the airport, according to a Reuters witness. 
U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet called on Friday for an investigation into alleged excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces against anti-Maduro protesters in recent days, adding that she was ""extremely concerned"" that the situation could rapidly spiral out of control.
""NO FAKE DIALOGUE""
Guaido, who has galvanized Venezuela's opposition, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday during a march of hundreds of thousands in Caracas. He is considering making a request for funds from international institutions including the International Monetary Fund, sources said on Friday.
However, he still has no control over the Venezuelan state and the military, which has so far remained loyal to Maduro despite a deep economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration, with inflation forecast to rise to 10 million percent this year.
Guaido has promised future amnesties to military members if they disavow Maduro, asking soldiers on Friday to ""put themselves on the side of the constitution.""
Most Latin American nations have joined the United States in supporting Guaido's claim on the presidency, although Mexico's new leftist government has said it would not take sides. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday his administration would be willing to mediate.
Guaido said he would reject any negotiations that did not include Maduro's exit, the setting up of a transition government, and free elections to pick a new president.
""No one wants fake dialogue ... the only thing we want to negotiate is the end of the usurpation,"" he told a crowd clustered in a plaza in Caracas' Chacao district, an opposition stronghold.
To ratchet up pressure on Maduro, who began a second term on Jan. 10 following an election last year widely considered to be a fraud, the United States is seeking to cut off funds for his government and is considering introducing fresh sanctions, including on its vital oil sector.
Maduro warned off any attempt to take control of U.S. refiner Citgo, the country's primary offshore asset. ""It is the property of the Venezuelan people, and we will defend it,"" he said.
The Maduro-appointed board of Citgo is preparing a legal strategy to defend itself against any attempts to divert its funds or change its board, sources said.
Oil prices edged higher on Friday as the political turmoil in the OPEC member threatened to tighten the global supply of crude. The U.S. has until now resisted significant oil sanctions because of the impact it would have on Venezuelan citizens already struggling with shortages.
""The oil situation has been an ethical moral dilemma for us,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, the no.2 Democrat in the Senate, in an interview. ""Cutting off all trade in oil would be the last step. It would make it even worse for the average person.""
The Trump administration is trying to make sure that any measures to restrict oil revenues to Maduro do not cause spikes in prices that would be felt by U.S. consumers, said Scott Modell, managing director of Rapidan Energy Group, who advises energy clients on geopolitical risks.

""How do they allow Venezuelan oil to continue to flow, while cutting off the flow of money back to Maduro and the government? That's the general playbook they have been using for Iran, and the one they are trying to adapt to Venezuela now,"" Modell said.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Refiner Citgo prepares to fend off Venezuela's opposition government,"By Marianna Parraga and Corina Pons
MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's most important foreign asset, its $10 billion U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum, is hunkering down to arm itself with a legal strategy to block efforts for its board to be removed and its revenues diverted to an opposition government, sources close to the talks said.
Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled congress who proclaimed himself president this week, is considering naming a new team to lead Citgo, two sources told Reuters.
But President Nicolas Maduro said in Caracas on Friday that his government would seek to defend the refiner, raising the prospect that Citgo, run by Maduro appointees, could become a battleground between the two claimants to the leadership of Venezuela. 
""Citgo is the property of the Venezuelan state,"" Maduro said, adding that the OPEC-member country plans to continue selling oil to the United States, its first destination for crude exports and state-run PDVSA's largest source of cash.    
The United States led numerous other Western Hemisphere nations in recognizing Guaido as president of Venezuela this week. The White House has been exploring ways to redirect oil revenues to the opposition, but the path to engineering such a move is unclear. 
Citgo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, but it has not been able to send its revenues, in the form of dividends, to Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions. 
Citgo's board earlier this week traveled to the Bahamas, where a company office was installed last year. It will seek legal avenues for the team to continue leading the firm, two company sources said. 
Citgo President Asdrubal Chavez has been called to meetings in Caracas, according to those sources. He is the cousin of late President Hugo Chavez, who preceded Maduro.
A Citgo vice president separately traveled to Washington this week for talks on the company's future, the sources added. 
""Citgo is registered in Delaware. It belongs to Venezuela, which now has two presidents. The United States only recognizes one, but that is not the one who appointed people at Citgo's board,"" one of the sources said, explaining the legal challenges. 
The Houston company's 750,000-barrel-per-day refining network is the biggest U.S. importer of Venezuelan crude. A spokeswoman at Citgo said executives were not being made available for interviews at this time.
For the first nine months of 2018, Citgo posted net income of about $500 million from $23 billion in gross sales and had $3.4 billion in financial debt, according to a creditor with access to its balances, which are not public. 
A Venezuelan opposition source familiar with Guaido's plans said the goal of the Citgo effort was to ""raise funds."" 
But it is unclear whether any effort to divert funds from Maduro-controlled PDVSA or its subsidiaries would succeed.
""I don't think that the Trump administration has the right to tell anybody where the oil revenues are going to go – certainly not at this stage,"" said Michael Fitzgerald, a partner at Paul Hastings who focuses on Latin America. 
EXTERNAL PRESSURE
Some creditors of Venezuela have engaged in the long legal process of trying to squeeze payments out of Caracas by pursuing Citgo. However, those creditors now run the risk of getting little in return for millions of dollars spent on legal fees if the United States moves against Venezuelan assets on its territory.
At the end of September, the company had almost $500 million in cash and an available $900 million credit line, the creditor said. The company is ""building cash,"" said S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings credit analyst Stephen Goltz, because of the U.S. sanctions
The White House earlier this month resumed talks with U.S. oil firms to explore new sanctions on Venezuela, including an embargo on Venezuelan crude sales to the United States and a prohibition on U.S. firms exporting fuels to the South American country.
The White House has resisted imposing an embargo on imports from Venezuela, in part because of opposition from U.S. refiners strapped for supply of heavy crude oil. 

U.S. refiners currently import about 500,000 barrels of oil daily from Venezuela. Much of the demand comes from complex refiners on the Gulf Coast that use the crude to make high-margin products like diesel.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>",Flights snarled at U.S. East Coast airports as controllers call in sick,"By Jonathan Allen and David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hundreds of flights were grounded or delayed at New York-area and Philadelphia airports on Friday as air traffic controllers called in sick hours before President Donald Trump announced an end to the 35-day partial shutdown of the U.S. government.
Trump said on Friday he had reached a deal with U.S. lawmakers for three weeks in stop-gap funding that would end the budget stalemate with Democrats.
The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop for flights destined for New York's LaGuardia Airport on Friday morning before lifting it just over an hour later. Staff shortages also delayed flights at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport, according to the FAA. 
Delays had impacted about a third of incoming flights to LaGuardia early on Friday, according to the FlightAware tracking service.
The White House had been briefed for weeks on aviation issues during the shutdown and Trump had gotten an update on Friday. Administration and congressional officials said they did not think Friday's flight disruptions was the deciding factor in ending the shutdown. But it was a mounting concern among administration officials.
Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or, as with some airport workers, required to work without pay, during the shutdown. Some federal agencies have reported much higher absence rates among workers who were working without paychecks.
John Hitt, a 51-year-old lawyer based in Boston, had expected to fly to Milwaukee via LaGuardia on Friday morning to visit his terminally ill aunt, but Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) told him his flight was delayed for at least two and a half hours. 
""I've had to scratch the trip, eat the cost of a rental car cancellation and now I'm starting over to figure out when I could get there,"" Hitt said in a telephone interview. ""With the uncertainty now created by the shutdown, it's making me hesitant to fly.""
Delta said about 200 of its flights were delayed at LaGuardia and other Northeast airports.
Paul Rinardi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said on Friday the association does not condone employees joining any coordinated activity that compromises safety, but that many controllers have reached ""the breaking point.""
Democrats in Congress also said that the system's safety would be jeopardized by a continuing shutdown. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday that the shutdown was ""pushing our airspace to the breaking point.""
FAA air traffic controllers guide the takeoff and landing of planes carrying around two million passengers daily, a job the FAA describes as having zero margin for error.
On Thursday, three major U.S. airlines -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) - said the impact of the shutdown on their business had so far been limited but was nearing a tipping point.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, praised the deal to reopen the government. ""As we have seen over the past 35 days, the pressures and strains of a shutdown are not sustainable. The disruptions to passengers, commerce and the economy are not tolerable,"" the group said in a statement.
The financial fortunes of airlines are closely tied to the health of the economy. In addition, airlines with hubs in Washington have said they have been losing government business as a result of the shutdown.
Delta said on Friday it had decided to postpone the debut of its Airbus A220 due to delays in the FAA certification process, while Southwest said the shutdown was delaying its plan to launch service to Hawaii, which also requires FAA approval.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian police said on Friday they had charged a minor with terror-related offences in connection with a pair of national security raids in Kingston, Ontario Thursday night.
Two people were arrested late Thursday after the raids. One, a minor, has been charged with knowingly facilitating terrorism and counseling a person to place a bomb ""or other lethal device"" in public, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a statement.
A bomb was never placed, police said. As a minor, the person cannot be named under Canadian law.
The second person was identified by his older sister, who spoke with Reuters, as 20-year-old Hussam Eddin Alzahabi. He has since been released with no charges, police confirmed Friday afternoon.
The investigation originated from a Federal Bureau of Investigation tip in December and involved multiple agencies, RCMP officers said during a press conference.
""It was a substantial and credible attack plot, however there was no indication of where that attack was going to take place"" and there was never any imminent danger to the public, RCMP officer Peter Lambertucci told reporters. 
He said officers conducting the Thursday night arrests detonated ""an element ... believed to be an explosive substance.""
""We are confident that there is no risk to public safety and there are no trace elements remaining,"" Lambertucci said.
Police burst into her family's house Thursday night and placed guns to her parents' heads, 21-year-old Rose Alzahabi told Reuters. 
""They got into the house in a really violent way,"" she said, adding that they wouldn't let her mother wear her hijab.
She said a man not known to the family had recently met her brother and his friend, approaching them near their high school and inviting them to do some computer programming for him. 
The man started coming to her family's home and asking ""absurd"" questions about how many rooms they had and whether he could see them, she said.
In an interview with CBC following the arrests, Alzahabi's father Amin Alzahabi protested his son's innocence. The family, originally from Syria, came to Canada as privately sponsored refugees, according to a pastor at one of the churches who sponsored them.
Bronek Korczynski, a church member who sponsored the Alzahabi family, said he worries about the way the arrests will shape perceptions of Muslims and refugees in Canada.
""That is a fear, because that’s the kind of ill-informed knee-jerk reaction that puts any group in potential harm’s way. ... This is hypothetically about two individuals who may or may not have made a bad decision.”
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the country's official threat level would remain unchanged at ""medium,"" where it has been since 2014.
Goodale told reporters Friday afternoon it was too early to say whether the alleged plot was connected to others elsewhere in the world and cautioned against making assumptions. 
""Rather than leaping to conclusions, let the police do their job, let's get the facts on the table,"" he told a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta.
Kingston is a small city east of Toronto, home to a major university and several prisons.
Rose Alzahabi was happy her brother was released, but she wasn't surprised.
""I was actually laughing the whole time because I know my brother did nothing: he would freak out if he saw someone playing with a knife,"" she said.
""He has a baby face; he would never hurt anyone.""

Cubana had to cancel most domestic flights last year due to a lack of flightworthy planes and lease aircraft from other companies. The carrier uses mainly Russian and Ukrainian-made Ilyushins, Tupolevs and Antonovs partly because U.S. sanctions prevent it from buying planes with a certain share of U.S. components. Cuba's cash crunch restricts it from paying for expensive repairs and spare parts.
After a high-level Russian-Cuban intergovernmental commission meeting in Moscow, Borisov said both sides had checked the repairs needed and had written contracts, without giving details on costs.
""Everything has passed to the practical stage and I consider that the Cuban fleet will be re-established in 2019,"" he said after meeting with Cuban Vice President Ricardo Cabrisas.
""We agreed in the future to work on creating a services center in Cuba dedicated to the aviation fleet in order to avoid a repetition of a negative situation.""
One of the aircraft Cubana leased, a 39-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737, crashed in May killing all but one of the 113 onboard. An investigation is underway.
Plans for Russia to upgrade Cuba's rail network are also advancing, Borisov was cited as saying.
In 2017, state-owned monopoly Russian Railways (RZD) said it was negotiating to upgrade more than 1,000 km (621.37 miles) of Cuban railroads and install a high-speed link between Havana and the beach resort of Varadero, in what would be Cuba's biggest infrastructure project in decades.
An RZD executive told Reuters in November 2017 the deal would be worth nearly 2 billion euros and signed by the end of the year. Since then, however, the deal's completion has not been announced.

""We agreed to divide it into stages and optimize the necessary credits in order to carry out this project,"" Borisov was cited as saying. ""I expect it to be put into practise in a near future.""

Vucic, a former ultra-nationalist who has become an advocate of closer ties with the West, is facing weekly demonstrations from opposition groups that accuse him of increasingly authoritarian rule. More protests are planned for Saturday.
Opposition parties and their backers accuse Vucic and his Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS) of stifling media freedoms and carrying out attacks on political opponents and journalists.
Demonstrators have been angered in particular by a firebomb attack on the home of a journalist, Milan Jovanovic, in Belgrade's suburb of Grocka last month. The attackers hurled a firebomb at a car in the garage and fired a pistol at the door as the house burned. The reporter escaped from a rear window.
Jovanovic says he was targeted over his reporting about corruption in his municipality.
In a televised address, Vucic said Grocka's mayor, who is also an official in the SNS party, had been taken for questioning over his role in the attack on the reporter's home.
""A party membership card will not save anyone from responsibility. Journalists will be protected no matter for whom they work for ... No one will be protected because of being a politician,"" Vucic said. 
He also pledged a tougher fight against politically motivated violence and cronyism, including changes in the legislature. 
Serbia wants to join the EU, tentatively by 2025, but to do so it must first root out corruption, organized crime, nepotism and red tape. 

Earlier this week, at a panel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Vucic said he was dissatisfied with media freedoms in Serbia and pledged to make an effort to help improve them.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari suspended the country's most senior judge on Friday weeks ahead of a presidential election, in what his challenger called an act of dictatorship and the bar association called an ""attempted coup"". 
Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and was voted into office in 2015, is seeking a fresh term in an election scheduled to take place on Feb. 16.
The chief justice could preside over a dispute over the election result. Nigeria's judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging.
Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen has been asked to appear before a tribunal over allegations of breaching asset-declaration rules. He has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him. 
Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave. 
""With the directive of the CCT (Code of Conduct Tribunal) in a letter dated 23rd January, 2019, accordingly, I hereby suspend Hon Justice Walter Nkanu Samuel Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria until the final determination of the case against him,"" Buhari said.
In a later tweet, the president said security agencies had traced ""suspicious transactions running into millions of dollars to the CJN's personal accounts, all undeclared or improperly declared as required by law"". He gave no further details. CJN refers to the chief justice of Nigeria.
A media aide to Onnoghen did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. 
Tanko Mohammed, a judge from the northeastern state of Bauchi, was named as the chief justice's acting replacement. 
On Thursday, an appeals court had issued an interim order to halt charges being brought against the chief justice.
Buhari's main challenger in the presidential vote, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, candidate for the main opposition People's Democratic Party, issued a statement titled: ""The purported suspension of CJN Onnoghen is an act of dictatorship taken too far.""
""(I) call on Justice Onnoghen and the judiciary to resist with every legal and constitutional means that they can muster,"" he said. ""This act of desperation is geared towards affecting the outcome of the 2019 Presidential elections,"" said Atiku.
The Nigerian Bar Association, in a statement, said it ""unequivocally rejects and condemns this attempted coup against the Nigerian judiciary and evident suspension of the Nigerian constitution"". 
""The action of the executive portends a slide into anarchy and complete deconstruction of the Rule of Law and due process,"" it said in the statement.

It urged a reversal of the suspension and called on parliament to assert its ""constitutional authority"" to intervene.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roger Stone, a self-proclaimed Republican ""dirty trickster"" and ally of U.S. President Donald Trump for 40 years, was arrested on Friday on charges of lying to Congress about the release of stolen Democratic Party emails during the 2016 campaign.
Stone is one of the closest Trump associates to be charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to help win the election. 
The 66-year-old veteran political operative was arrested by the FBI in a predawn raid at his Florida home. 
The charges against him add to pressure on Trump as the newly installed Democratic majority in the House of Representatives plans to step up investigations of the president while a month-long partial shutdown of the U.S. government over Trump's demand for funding for a border wall drags on.
""Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION!,"" Trump said on Twitter following Stone's arrest, using his most common slur for the Mueller probe. 
Mueller said in court papers that Stone had advance knowledge of a plan by WikiLeaks to release the emails, which some political analysts say may have contributed to Trump's stunning election defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
The indictment refers to coordination between Stone and a senior Trump campaign official, who a source identified as Steve Bannon. 
Stone was charged with seven criminal counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, witness tampering and making false statements. 
STONE BLASTS 'INQUISITION'
In a rowdy scene outside a courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Stone said he had done no wrong.
""After a two-year inquisition the charges today related in no way to Russian collusion, WikiLeaks coordination or any other illegal act in connection with the 2016 campaign,"" he told reporters after the hearing, flashing the twin ""V for Victory"" signs that late President Richard Nixon was famous for.
A crowd chanted ""Lock Him Up,"" an inversion of the ""Lock Her Up"" chant that Trump and his surrogates led against Clinton at rallies during the 2016 campaign. Someone played the Beatles song ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""
Stone denounced his arrest as politically motivated and complained that arresting agents had threatened his dogs. A judge released him on a $250,000 bond and ordered him to limit his travel to South Florida, New York City and Washington. 
The indictment showed Stone using language evoking mob bosses -- and even cited a ""Godfather"" movie -- as he called an unnamed associate facing FBI inquiries ""a rat. A stoolie"" in a series of profanity-laced messages. 
Stone was an early Trump backer whose reputation as an aggressive political operative dates back to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s when he was working for Nixon. He has a tattoo of the face of the disgraced Republican former president on his back. 
WikiLeaks, which is referred to as ""Organization 1"" in the indictment, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Thirty-five people have pleaded guilty, been indicted or otherwise swept up in the Russia inquiry, which has clouded Trump's two-year-old presidency.
Those people include former close associates of Trump such as his one-time lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as well as 12 Russian intelligence officers.
White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders said the Stone indictment was unrelated to the president. 
""The charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the White House,"" she told CNN. ""The president did nothing wrong.""
The charging documents included new details about the alleged activities of Trump aides, including an incident in which a senior campaign official ""was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign.""
The indictment referred to an October 2016 email from the ""high-ranking Trump Campaign official"" asking Stone to inquire about future releases of emails by ""Organization 1."" Stone responded that ""Organization 1"" would release ""a load every week going forward.""
The high-ranking official is Bannon, Trump's former campaign chief, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment. 
STUMP CALL TO RUSSIA
The interactions with Wikileaks covered in the indictment occurred days before Trump famously called out to Russia in a campaign stump speech for help finding ""missing"" emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state, according to Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff. 
""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said on the campaign, a comment that vexed intelligence experts and prompted Democrats to accuse him of urging a foreign country to spy on Americans.
""At the very time that then-candidate Trump was publicly encouraging Russia’s help in acquiring Clinton-related emails, his campaign was privately receiving information about the planned release of stolen Clinton emails,"" Schiff said in a statement.
The Kremlin has denied interfering with the 2016 election..
Stone's ties to Trump go back decades. Stone has urged Trump to run for president since 1988, was chairman of his presidential exploratory committee in 2000 and was a consultant when Trump considered running in 2012, according to Stone’s 2017 book about Trump’s campaign for the White House.
Stone briefly worked for the Trump campaign but left in August 2015. The campaign said it fired him after he tried to grab too much of the spotlight while Stone insisted that he quit. 

Even after Stone left his official position in the campaign, he still played a key promotional role and communicated with people in Trump's camp.

""This is now the second witness who has been indicted for or plead guilty to making false statements in testimony before our Committee,"" Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement. ""The first order of business for the Committee will be to release all remaining transcripts to the Special Counsel's Office, and we will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead.”
Schiff and Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the House oversight committee, said on Wednesday they expect Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to testify before both panels, despite his decision to postpone his Feb. 7 appearance, citing threats against his family from Trump. 
The chairmen said they understood Cohen's security concerns, but added in a statement: “This will not stop us from getting to the truth. We expect Mr. Cohen to appear before both committees, and we remain engaged with his counsel about his upcoming appearances.”

Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to charges including lying to Congress.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Kremlin-linked contractors help guard Venezuela's Maduro - sources,"By Maria Tsvetkova and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Private military contractors who do secret missions for Russia flew into Venezuela in the past few days to beef up security for President Nicolas Maduro in the face of U.S.-backed opposition protests, according to two people close to them.
A third source close to the Russian contractors also told Reuters there was a contingent of them in Venezuela, but could not say when they arrived or what their role was.
Russia, which has backed Maduro's socialist government to the tune of billions of dollars, this week promised to stand by him after opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself president with Washington's endorsement.
It was the latest international crisis to split the global superpowers, with the United States and Europe backing Guaido, and Russia and China urging non-interference.
Yevgeny Shabayev, leader of a local chapter of a paramilitary group of Cossacks with ties to Russian military contractors, said he had heard the number of Russian contractors in Venezuela may be about 400.
But the other sources spoke of small groups.
Russia's Defence Ministry and Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the contractors. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We have no such information.""
The contractors are associated with the so-called Wagner group whose members, mostly ex-service personnel, fought clandestinely in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine, according to Reuters interviews with dozens of contractors, their friends and relatives.
A person believed to work for the Wagner group did not respond to a message asking for information.
Citing contacts in a Russian state security structure, Shabayev said the contingent flew to Venezuela at the start of this week, a day or two before opposition protests started.
CUBA CONNECTION?
He said they set off in two chartered aircraft for Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela. The Cuban government, a close ally of Venezuela's ruling socialists for the last two decades, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The contractors' task in Venezuela was to protect Maduro from any attempt by opposition sympathizers in his own security forces to detain him, Shabayev said.
""Our people are there directly for his protection,"" he said.
Venezuelan authorities said they had put down an attempted revolt on Monday by rogue military officers about a kilometer from the presidential palace in Caracas. 
Maduro, the 56-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, only takes to the streets in carefully-controlled situations, since crowds have barracked him in the past. 
One of the two anonymous Russian sources, who is close to the Wagner group and fought in foreign conflicts where it was active, said the contractors first arrived in advance of the May 2018 presidential election, but another group arrived ""recently.""
Asked if the deployment was linked to protecting Maduro, the source said: ""It's directly connected."" The contractors flew to Venezuela not from Moscow but from third countries where they were conducting missions, he added.
The third source, who is close to the private military contractors, said there was a contingent in Venezuela but he could not provide further details.
""They did not arrive in a big crowd,"" he said.
Publicly-available flight-tracking data has shown a number of Russian government aircraft landing in or near Venezuela over past weeks, though there was no evidence the flights were connected to military contractors.
A Russian Ilyushin-96 flew into Havana late on Wednesday after starting its journey in Moscow and flying via Senegal and Paraguay, the data showed. 
The aircraft, a civilian jet, is owned by a division of the Russian presidential administration, according to a publicly-available procurement contract relating to the plane.

Between Dec. 10 and Dec. 14 last year, an Antonov-124 heavy cargo aircraft, and an Ilyushin-76 transport aircraft, carried out flights between Russia and Caracas, flight-tracking data showed. Another Ilyushin-76 was in Caracas from Dec. 12 to Dec. 21 last year. All three aircraft belong to the Russian air force, according to the tracking data.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",EU adds Saudi Arabia to draft terrorism financing list: sources,"BRUSSELS/RIYADH (Reuters) - The European Commission has added Saudi Arabia to an EU draft list of countries that pose a threat to the bloc because of lax controls against terrorism financing and money laundering, two sources told Reuters on Friday.
The move comes amid heightened international pressure on Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
The EU's list currently consists of 16 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and North Korea, and is mostly based on criteria used by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body composed by wealthy nations meant to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. 
But the list has been updated this week, using new criteria developed by the EU Commission since 2017. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries added to the updated list which is still confidential, one EU source and one Saudi source told Reuters.
Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The move is a setback for Riyadh at a time when it is striving to bolster its international reputation in order to encourage foreign investors to participate in a huge transformation plan and improve financial ties for its banks.
Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at its Istanbul consulate on Oct 2, provoking widespread revulsion and damaging the kingdom's image.
Apart from reputational damages, the inclusion in the list complicates financial relations with the EU. The bloc's banks will have to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from listed jurisdictions. 
The provisional decision needs to be endorsed by the 28 EU states before being formally adopted next week.
COMPANY OWNERSHIP
A second EU official said other countries are likely to be added to the final list but declined to elaborate as the information is still confidential and subject to changes.
An EU commission spokesman said he had no comment on the content of the list as it had not been finalised yet.
Countries are blacklisted if they ""have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union,"" the existing EU list says.
Under the new EU methodology, jurisdictions could also be blacklisted if they do not provide sufficient information on ownership of companies or if their rules on reporting suspicious transactions or monitoring financial customers are considered too lax. 
Saudi Arabia missed out on gaining full FATF membership in September after it was determined to fall short in combating money laundering and terror financing. 
The government has taken steps to beef up its efforts to tackle graft and abuse of power, but FATF said in September that Riyadh was not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale money laundering activity or confiscating the proceeds of crime at home or abroad.
The EU has reviewed 47 jurisdictions, including the United States, Russia and Switzerland, before updating its list. EU countries were not screened.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>","Qatar to pay aid into Gaza, with Hamas approval","By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA (Reuters) - Qatar on Friday said it will pay $20 million in humanitarian aid to boost the ailing economy of Gaza, a day after the coastal strip's Palestinian rulers stopped the oil-rich Gulf state from paying money directly to impoverished government workers there.
The move was widely seen as a compromise between Qatar, which appears intent on increasing its regional influence, and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza.
Qatar’s point-man for Gaza relief efforts, Mohammed Al-Emadi, said in Gaza: ""It was agreed to allocate the Qatari financial grant to pay for humanitarian projects with full cooperation and coordination with the United Nations.""
He said the first agreement with the U.N. would be signed on Monday next week, setting up a $20 million job creation project.
A Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, on Friday welcomed Qatar's decision to give money to humanitarian projects. 
A day earlier Hamas had blocked direct Qatari payments to thousands of unpaid Palestinian civil servants in Gaza, claiming that Israel had broken agreements about how the arrangement would be carried out.
The compromise follows a tortuous regional standoff that has left civil servants in Gaza caught up in a bitter power struggle between Hamas and the western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. 
Hamas wants to pay the workers that it hired, but doesn't have enough money after years of Israeli-led blockades, wars and the failure of reconciliation efforts with Abbas. Wages have been cut in half for several years, and payments were often behind schedule. 
Abbas has refused to pay them, hoping that by slashing salaries, and thereby worsening economic conditions in Gaza, he can force Hamas back to the negotiating table.
Israel regards Hamas as an implacable Islamist enemy, but fears that instability in Gaza will spill over into violence against Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government initially blocked the latest Qatari transfer, but relented on Thursday after the Israeli military recommended that it be allowed in.
On Friday, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man during weekly protests along its border with Gaza, local health officials said. Contacted by Reuters, Israel's military said they were checking the report.
Palestinians launched weekly border protests nine months ago demanding the right of return to land from which their ancestors fled or were forced to flee during Israel's founding in 1948 and an end to a grinding Israeli blockade of the territory, home for two million people.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's High Court deferred until next week a decision on whether to free an activist pastor detained over violent anti-government protests.
Evan Mawarire, who led a national shutdown in 2016 against Robert Mugabe, is accused of stoking the unrest which was countered by a violent crackdown reminiscent of the actions of security forces under the former president.
Prosecutors argued against the bail application, saying Mawarire posed a flight risk and could re-offend if released. 
Judge Tawanda Chitapi said he would rule on Tuesday but hinted he could ban Mawarire from posting videos similar to the one that the state says encouraged unrest until the trial is over.
Protests erupted in mid-January following a hike in fuel prices and lasted for several days. 
Security forces dispersed demonstrations by force and cracked down on activists, leading to fears that President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government is reverting to the strong-arm politics seen during Mugabe's 37-year rule. 
Amnesty International said children as young as 11 had been detained along with hundreds others. 
""The authorities must immediately stop this merciless crackdown on activists, civil society leaders and others who are guilty of nothing more than exercising their right to freedom of expression,"" Amnesty's Deprose Muchena said in a statement.
""The authorities must ensure that those who violated and continue to violate human rights face justice.""
Zimbabwe's independent Human Rights Commission has accused security forces of systematic torture. The opposition says soldiers are apparently able to shoot and kill without being held accountable. An official inquiry said the army shot civilians to quell post-election violence last August.
Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe after a de facto coup in November 2017, promised this week to investigate security services' actions against protesters.
Courts in the capital Harare and other towns heard cases of more than 100 people accused of public order offences linked to the demonstrations, lawyers said.
Mawarire, who denies the charges remains in detention at Chikurubi Maximum Prison in Harare and was not present at Friday's hearing.

Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions Peter Mutasa, who called for a peaceful stay-at-home strike in a video post with Mawarire, presented himself to police in Harare in the company of his lawyer. The union's secretary general is already detained on subversion charges.

Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, allegedly a former militia leader, was detained on Dec. 12 while in France on official business, his lawyer told judges. A French court approved his extradition on Dec. 31.
He was arrested while on ""an official mission order saying he was president of the Central African Football Federation,"" lawyer Eric Plouvier told the court. Ngaissona was elected top executive of CAF, Africa’s football governing body, last year.
ICC prosecutors accuse Ngaissona, 51, of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, deportation, persecution, torture, attacking civilians, and recruiting child soldiers.
Ngaissona, who earlier denied the charges, spoke only briefly in court to confirm his identity and that he was informed of the charges against him.
A follow-up hearing was set for June 18, when prosecutors will provide details about their indictment.
Ngaissona has been described by prosecutors as the ""senior leader"" of the mostly Christian anti-balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks against the Muslim population in 2013-2014.
The Central African Republic has been mired in violence since a coalition of mostly northern rebels known as Seleka seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the anti-balaka militia, who opposed them.
The ICC has said it is investigating crimes committed by all parties in the conflict.

In November, Alfred Yekatom, another leader of the anti-balaka militia and a sitting member of the country's parliament, was handed over to the ICC.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece on Friday ratified a landmark accord that changes the name of neighbouring Macedonia, ending a decades-old dispute with its neighbour and opening the way for the ex-Yugoslav republic to join the European Union and NATO. 
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who hammered out the deal with his Macedonian counterpart last year, secured enough votes to scrape the vote through a deeply-divided parliament on the third day of a debate fraught with emotion, anger and cries of betrayal.
The settlement seeks to end a 28-year old row between Athens and Skopje over the use of the term ""Macedonia"" by renaming the tiny Balkan state ""Republic of North Macedonia"" to differentiate from Greece's northern province of Macedonia. 
Many Greeks opposing the deal view it as an attempt by their neighbours to hijack ancient Greek civilization and culture. 
But Tsipras, a leftist firebrand who swept to power an anti-austerity platform as Greece was deep in financial crisis in 2015, made a point of pursuing a deal.
""This is a historic day for Greece, ending a pending issue which was a burden on our foreign policy,"" Tsipras told journalists.
Greece's European Union allies, who once shuddered at the anti-austerity rhetoric from the 45-year old premier, welcomed the ratification. 
""They had imagination, they took the risk, they were ready to sacrifice their own interests for the greater good,"" European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted. ""Mission impossible accomplished.""
GREEKS ANGRY, MEDIATORS RELIEVED
The dispute has been on the United Nations agenda for almost three decades, ever since the break-up of former Yugoslavia in 1991 and Greece, swept up by nationalist rage, slapped a short-lived trade embargo on the tiny landlocked state.
Matthew Nimetz, a veteran U.N. diplomat who worked on the matter for years, called ratification ""visionary"".
""This historic agreement between two neighbours opens the door to a new relationship between them and ushers in a new era for the consolidation of peace and security in the Balkans,"" he said in a statement.
The row had stymied Macedonian attempts to join the EU and the NATO military alliance in a region where the two organizations jostle for influence with Russia. 
Moscow had taken a dim view of the accord; Greece had taken an unprecedented step in mid 2018 of expelling four Russians, including two with diplomat status, for perceived meddling on the matter.
Opinion polls show that most Greeks oppose the settlement, a fact which may not bode well for Tsipras in an election year. A general election is due by October, and his party is trailing the main opposition, the conservative New Democracy party, by up to 12 points.
The debate in parliament was heated, with voting almost interrupted on Friday when an MP for the far-right Golden Dawn Party, asked to cast his vote, responded: ""No to treason!"" 
Protests against the deal have at times turned violent this week, and on Thursday evening police fired teargas to disperse crowds outside parliament. Smaller groups of people braved heavy rain on Friday to demonstrate outside parliament. 
New Democracy slammed the agreement.

""This deal should never have been signed or brought to parliament for ratification,"" party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament. ""It is a national defeat ... a national blunder that is an affont to the truth and history of our country.""

765,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Macron faces diplomatic test in Egypt amid human rights pressure,"By John Irish and Marine Pennetier
PARIS (Reuters) - When French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Paris in October 2017, five months after taking office, he handed him a list of activists he believed the Egyptian president could release from prison.
Sisi looked at Macron, suggested he was naive and meticulously outlined the reasons why each person should not be released, stressing their links to Islamists or the Muslim Brotherhood, three sources aware of the exchange told Reuters. 
Taken aback, the young French president, who sees Sisi as a stabilizing force in the region and wants to bolster trade and defense ties with Cairo, told a subsequent news conference it was not up to him to ""lecture"" Egypt on civil liberties. 
Fast-forward 13 months and Macron is nuancing his approach, French officials say. As he prepares for a three-day visit to Egypt starting on Sunday, he hopes to secure more business and defense contracts while not abandoning the human rights file.
The problem Macron faces is that while he has been less outspoken on rights since his first meeting with Sisi, Egypt hasn't come through on defense and civilian deals, and rights groups say the crackdown on liberties has only worsened. 
NGOs are piling pressure on Macron to be firm in confronting the Egyptian president, who in April secured a second term, shoring up his position as a powerbroker in the region.
The Elysee admits to an ""evolution"" in Macron's thinking. 
""The president's approach in October 2017 was maybe a bit different ... but time has passed,"" a presidential adviser said.
This time, rather than delivering a narrow list of names of people who should be released from prison, French authorities have sent Cairo a broader accounting of human rights shortcomings and jailed non-Islamist activists that they think Sisi will find it harder to dismiss out of hand. 
SHARED CONCERNS ON LIBYA, JIHADISTS 
""I think Macron realizes that there have been limits to his silent diplomacy,"" said a French diplomatic source. ""He needs to find a balance between not upsetting Sisi and making a public point about human rights.""
After Sisi rose to power in 2014, Franco-Egyptian relations strengthened. Both countries shared concerns about a political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt.
Former French President Francois Hollande took a quiet approach on rights, and defense deals were signed, including the sale of 24 Rafale combat aircraft, a multi-mission frigate and two Mistral warships, deals worth some 6 billion euros. 
""Partly in return for France's blind eye in the realm of human rights and democratic standards, Cairo bought billions' worth of weaponry,"" said Jalel Harchaoui, a geopolitics lecturer at the University of Versailles. ""But things have changed a bit lately. Sisi's grip on power is much firmer.""
Since Macron came to power, business has cooled. France's trade surplus with Egypt has not improved in three years, hovering at about a billion euros. Germany and other states have managed to secure major civilian contracts. 
An Egyptian pledge to buy a further 12 Rafale fighters has been on hold for almost two years. French officials hope that may change in the coming weeks, although there is an awareness that signing such a contract during Macron's visit would be poor optics amid the clamor over human rights.
""In private, they are saying Macron has understood, but the test for him will be whether it's just words to keep us happy or there is something concrete like the release of prisoners at the end of it,"" said one official with a Paris-based NGO.
Whether Macron can find a formula of words and actions that keeps human rights on the agenda and convinces Sisi to re-engage on trade remains unclear. But even if he can convince the Egyptian president that France is a trusted partner, it may not be enough, given Cairo's financial situation.

""Egypt's debt crisis makes additional high-profile purchases of French hardware by Cairo less likely,"" Harchaoui said, referring to the state's heavy IMF borrowing. ""Amid that new environment, France's ideological support remains unwavering, but has become less relevant.""

766,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>","Advocating stability abroad, Merkel must mind pitfalls at home","By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Addressing world leaders in Davos this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a robust defense of multilateralism, but looming pitfalls at home risk undermining her globe-trotting advocacy for international cooperation before too long.
Merkel's Davos speech set out her ambition in 2019: use ""win-win"" diplomacy to defend the multilateral order on which German fortunes rest and which is under threat from President Donald Trump's ""America First"" approach. 
Merkel has a new global platform to work with. For the next two years, Germany has a seat on the U.N. Security Council and she intends to use it to resist growing nationalism.
The chancellor is already networking, intending to fly to this year's G20 president Japan in early February to coordinate with a like-minded power, while selling her multilateral message to lawmakers at home.
""You can see that foreign policy is now a major focus of her work since she gave up the CDU chair in December,"" Elisabeth Motschmann, a lawmaker with Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said after the chancellor spoke to a closed-door session of parliament's foreign relations committee last week.
Merkel's decision last October to give up the CDU leadership, after the party bled support in a regional poll, but stay on as chancellor for the parliamentary term running through to 2021 left many in Germany believing she was a lame duck.
But since her protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, took over the CDU leadership in December, Merkel has left her to plot the party's domestic strategy while she focuses on foreign policy.
The strategy looks fine, so long as the CDU performs well.
TROUBLE AHEAD?
However, setbacks for Merkel's conservatives, and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, in European and regional elections starting in May could destabilize - or even end - Merkel's fragile ruling alliance.
The coalition government came close to collapse several times in 2018 and, although the conservative and SPD allies are determined to get on better this year, the elections could test the cohesion of their marriage of convenience once more.
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) looms large over three regional elections in September and October in the former East, where the far-right party is threatening to surpass Merkel's CDU and become the largest party.
Merkel's allies are already plotting how to win back voters from the AfD, but they are also sweating on the fate of the SPD, Germany's oldest party, which is facing an existential crisis and has the option to quit the coalition at an autumn review.
""We have a common interest in there being stable, large, 'big tent' parties (Volksparteien),"" said Health Minister Jens Spahn, a senior CDU figure. ""So 2019 will be a year when the Volksparteien must assert themselves.""
The AfD, which surged into the national parliament for the first time in 2017 on the back of widespread discontent with Merkel's open-door refugee policy, trails the CDU only narrowly in Saxony and Thuringia, two of the three states to hold the autumn elections.
In the third, Brandenburg, it is level with the CDU and just behind the SPD. Such is the far-right party's strength that one CDU regional leader is even open to the possibility of teaming up with the far-left Linke to keep the AfD out of power.
Should the AfD overtake the CDU in the elections in the eastern states, discussion would likely resume about Merkel leaving office before 2021.
MULTIPLE CHALLENGES
May's European parliamentary elections pose another risk.
Merkel's Bavarian allies are desperate for their candidate, Manfred Weber, to emerge from the vote as the next European Commission president. A poor showing by their conservative alliance could make the Bavarians troublesome allies again. 
""Then the charge will be heard loudly again, that the chancellor doesn't explain Europe well enough,"" said Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin's Free University.
A final domestic pitfall for Merkel is the fate of the SPD, who risk losing their state premier in Bremen in a regional election in May.
The party of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, two of Germany's great post-war statesmen, has slumped to 15 percent in polls and could exercise an option in the coalition agreement to pull out of the ruling alliance at an autumn mid-term review.
SPD sources say the party leaders are determined to keep the coalition going through to 2021. SPD lawmakers also have no interest in an early election that might cost them their seats.
All the same, the pressures of the European and regional elections are likely to absorb Merkel's attention from May.
""It's highly unlikely Merkel will be able to assume a position of global leadership this year,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, citing the elections, the coalition's fragility and her efforts to manage a smooth exit after 2019.

""That's a tough domestic context to manage through before coming up for air in Europe or beyond.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey expects its allies to help set up a ""safe zone"" in Syria along the Turkish border within a few months, otherwise it will establish the zone alone, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump decided in December to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and Erdogan subsequently said they had discussed Turkey setting up a 20-mile-deep safe zone in Syria along the border. 
Trump's decision came as Turkey made preparations for an offensive against the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia east of the Euphrates river in northeast Syria, having seized control of regions west of the river in previous operations.
Turkey has long been enraged by U.S. support for the YPG, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group, and Erdogan said the safe zone should be ""aimed at protecting our country from terrorists, not protecting terrorists right beside our border"".
""Otherwise, we will definitely form this safe or buffer zone ourselves. Our only expectation from our allies is that they provide logistical support to Turkey's effort,"" he told his AK Party supporters in a speech in the eastern city of Erzurum.
The YPG has been a key ally of the United States in the fight against Islamic State, and Trump has previously warned Ankara not to attack them in Syria, appearing to threaten Turkey's economy if it did. 
Trump's decision to withdraw troops from the Kurdish-led region, which confounded his own national security team, has also led to a revival in attempts at dialogue between the YPG and the Syrian government.
The YPG's commander has told Reuters he believes talks with Damascus over the future of the region it controls in northeast Syria will begin in days after a ""positive"" reaction from Damascus.
ONLY TURKEY CAPABLE
Erdogan said that neither the United Nations nor the international coalition formed to protect the Syrian people were capable of creating a safe zone or maintaining security in the region.
""The only power that can in a true sense establish the safety and functioning of this region on our Syrian border is Turkey,"" he said. ""We are closed to all proposed solutions besides this.""
He said Turkey had the right to enter Syrian territory when it faces threats under a 1998 agreement, which Ankara reached with Damascus after pressuring Syria to expel Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan, now jailed in Turkey.
Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.
U.S. special Syria envoy James Jeffrey, visiting Ankara for talks with Turkish officials, held talks with Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and Turkish armed forces chief General Yasar Guler on Friday, the defence ministry said.

During the talks, Akar said Turkey expected the United States to end its support for the YPG and complete the road map which the two countries agreed upon for the Syrian town of Manbij to the west of the Euphrates, the statement said.

PARIS (Reuters) - A decision by a small group of ""yellow vest"" protesters to contest May's European Parliament elections has exposed deep splits within their amorphous anti-government movement about whether and how to become a more organized political force.
Yet though they have so far drawn up a list of only 10 candidates, they could prove a disruptive force, with one opinion poll this week suggesting they could steal votes from the far-right and inadvertently help President Emmanuel Macron, whose policies triggered their original protests.
Accused by some activists of betraying the movement, Ingrid Levavasseur, who leads the new grouping's candidate list, said on Friday she sought change through political dialogue, and she distanced herself from the movement's violent fringe.
""We want to bring democratic debate (to French politics),"" the 31-year-old assistant nurse told RMC radio. ""We don't all want to overthrow the president.""
The yellow vests, named after high-visibility vests French drivers are required to keep in their cars, began their protests in November against fuel tax hikes that Macron then scrapped.
They quickly spiraled into a broader movement against the political elite and inequality, triggering some of the capital's worst street violence in decades. 
But the movement is leaderless and split along open faultlines: between radicals who want to oust Macron and moderates who back dialogue, and between those who wish it to remain a grassroots, apolitical movement and those who see an opportunity to break into politics.
""NO POLITICAL CONVICTIONS""
It has been a bruising 48 hours for Levavasseur, who has emerged from obscurity to become a household name in France.
Some yellow vests who see the European Parliament as undemocratic and a waste of money have branded her a ""traitor"".
""A vote for the 'yellow vests' is a vote for Macron,"" said Eric Drouet, who heads a faction within the movement called ""Angry France"".
Another rival, Benjamin Cauchy, asked Levavasseur in a terse exchange on LCI television if she supported a federal Europe or a Europe of member states.
When she replied that she had no position, Cauchy shot back: ""You're head of the list and you have no political convictions.""
Levavasseur dismissed the accusation that she was betraying the movement: ""Let's be clear, if the yellow vests don't run (in the EU elections) someone else will in their name.""
The survey by pollster Elabe, published on Wednesday, showed the ""yellow vests"" winning 13 percent of the vote in France.
It also showed Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally - formerly the National Front - winning 20.5 percent of votes without a yellow vest list. This fell to 17.5 percent with a yellow vest challenge, while Macron's centrist pro-EU party would suffer only a 1 point fall to 22.5 percent.

Le Pen, who lost to Macron in the second round of France's 2017 presidential election, has appealed for the support of the broad yellow vest movement in the EU elections, speaking of their ""healthy popular revolt"" against an ""incompetent president"".

Players of ""Our Guys In Salisbury"" roll dice to advance across the board from Moscow to Salisbury, the city where Britain says two Russian spies used a chemical weapon to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter. They both survived but another person who came into contact with the chemical died.
Russia denies involvement, and the two suspects say they were visiting the city as tourists to see its cathedral. The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on them.
The winner of the game is the one who makes it across Europe to Salisbury - whose cathedral appears on the board in crosshairs next to chemical weapons experts wearing protective suits - with the most points.

BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - NATO and Russia failed on Friday to resolve a dispute over a new Russian missile that Western allies say is a threat to Europe, bringing closer Washington's withdrawal from a landmark arms control treaty.
At a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels, envoys from NATO's 29 members renewed their call on Moscow's deputy foreign minister to destroy a nuclear-capable cruise missile system before a Feb. 2 deadline. 
Without a breakthrough, the United States is set to start the six-month process of pulling out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), having notified it would do so in early December and accusing Moscow of breaching it.
Russia denies violating the terms of the treaty, which eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
""The treaty is in real jeopardy,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""The sooner Russia comes back into compliance, the better. The treaty has no value if it is not respected, the problem are the Russian missiles in Europe,"" he told a news conference after the meeting.
One NATO diplomat said the U.S. ambassador to the alliance told the assembled diplomats and officials that Washington would start the pull-out process from the INF on Feb. 2. The U.S. embassy was not immediately available for comment.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the closed-door meeting that it was the United States that was breaching the treaty, alliance diplomats said. 
Ryabkov, who spoke in both Russian and English, cited the U.S.-built NATO missile defense system in Romania as a treaty breach. NATO says the shield is designed to shoot down rockets from Iran, not from Russia. 
Separately, the Russian foreign ministry also accused the United States of reviving a Cold War-era plan to deploy a missile defense system in space.
While NATO diplomats described Friday's meeting as calm and professional, Stoltenberg said Russia had shown no willingness to compromise. But he and some European nations such as Germany held out hope for diplomatic progress during the six-month withdrawal process. 
""PURE SHOW""
Russia stands accused of developing land-based, intermediate-range cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and hitting European cities at short notice, breaching the Cold War-era pact that took such rockets out of Europe.
But the Kremlin, which this week displayed its missiles to foreign military attaches in Moscow, says the missiles' short range puts it outside the INF treaty. It says the Novator 9M729/SSC-8 rockets have a maximum range of 480 km (298 miles). 
NATO diplomats repeated their view that there was no way of verifying that information because the missiles have only been shown publicly in a ""static display"" that gives no indication of their flying distance. One NATO diplomat said the Russian display on Wednesday was ""pure show"".
Some NATO diplomats believe that Russia may have developed the new missile system, which is mobile and easy to hide in forests and other strategic locations, to counter Chinese missile programs, but that did not justify deploying it.
The 1987 treaty requires the United States and Russia ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles) ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles"".

Russia, the United States, France, Britain and China - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - are due to meet in Beijing on Jan. 30 to discuss arms control, diplomats told Reuters. But it was not clear if the INF treaty would be on the agenda.

Around 12,000 elite troops, armoured vehicles, fighter jets and drones were taking part in the two-day exercises, staged in the central province of Isfahan, state television said.
Deployed by transport planes and 60 helicopters, commandos hunted mock armed militants, while an armoured battalion blocked ""enemy"" forces trying to retreat, state media said.
""In these war-games we will showcase two important developments: a special-forces rapid deployment battalion and a highly mobile offensive armoured battalion,"" General Kioumars Heydari, head of the regular army's ground forces, told state television.
Heydari said the war games would delight Iran's friends and show any aggressors that they would face a ""rapid and crushing blow"" by the Iranian army, the state news agency IRNA reported.
Relations between Iran and the United States, always frosty, have deteriorated further following President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of an international accord curbing Tehran's nuclear programme and to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran.
Tensions have also risen between Iran and arch-enemy Israel as well as its Gulf neighbours, especially Saudi Arabia, while last September Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on a military parade in which 25 people were killed. 
Iran holds military exercises several times a year to demonstrate its readiness to respond to any foreign aggression.
Western defence analysts say Iran often exaggerates its military strength.

Huawei faces growing scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and allegations that Beijing could use its technology for spying. It denies those allegations.
Czech state and private institutions are analyzing risks after the country's national cyber-security watchdog, NUKIB, warned about potential dangers in using technology from Huawei and another Chinese firm, ZTE (HK:0763).
Their products have so far not been banned or excluded from planned upgrades of mobile networks to the next-generation 5G technology in the Czech Republic. 
""It is necessary to start debate on cyber security on the level of all EU member states, because this is a global issue,"" CTK quoted Babis as saying after meeting Ken Hu, Huawei's rotating chairman.
Babis said security audits of risks have been started based on the December NUKIB warning, which he said critical infrastructure operators must follow under the law. 
Europe has become a battleground in a struggle between Beijing and Washington that analysts say could determine which of them achieves technological supremacy in the 21st century.
Huawei is playing a leading role as the telecoms world gears up for 5G, the next-generation wireless technology that promises to link everything from vehicles to household devices at far faster speeds.
But some Western countries, including the United States and Australia, have barred Huawei after U.S. officials said the company is close to the Chinese state and its equipment may contain ""back doors"" that could open them up to cyber espionage.
Germany is considering stricter security requirements for 5G that would exclude Huawei, the newspaper Handelsblatt reported last week.
Poland is also set to exclude Huawei from its 5G network in favor of European vendors after a Huawei employee was arrested on suspicion of spying, sources said.

In the Czech Republic, Huawei has been publicly backed by President Milos Zeman, who has long promoted close cooperation with China.

Yanghee Lee, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, was speaking during a trip to Thailand and Bangladesh, where she met officials and Rohingya driven out of western Rakhine state after an army crackdown in 2017.
""Min Aung Hlaing and others should be held accountable for genocide in Rakhine and for crimes against humanity and war crimes in other parts of Myanmar,"" said Lee, who is barred from the country, referring to the military's commander-in-chief.
Her interview marked the first time Lee has publicly called for the army chief to be prosecuted for genocide. A U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar last year said that the military campaign, which refugees say included mass killings and rape, was orchestrated with ""genocidal intent"" and recommended charging Min Aung Hlaing and five other generals with the ""gravest crimes under international law"".
Since August 2017 some 730,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine to Bangladesh, where they now live overcrowded camps.
""For any repatriation to happen ... the perpetrators must be held to account, because sending the refugees back with no accountability is going to really exacerbate or prolong the horrific situation in Myanmar,"" Lee told Reuters in an interview in Thailand on Jan. 18. ""And then we'll see another cycle of expulsion again.""
Spokesmen for Myanmar's military and government could not be reached for comment. The country has previously denied almost all allegations made by refugees against its troops, who it says were engaged in legitimate counter-terrorism operations.
LEGAL ROUTES
The U.N. Security Council in September voted to approve the establishment of an ""ongoing independent mechanism"" for Myanmar that would collect, consolidate, and preserve evidence of crimes that could be used in an eventual court case.
Lee said the independent mechanism would provide funds for ""victim support"", including money for criminal cases.
Myanmar has said it ""absolutely rejects"" that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction to rule on its actions. The country is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the Hague-based court.
Non-parties can be referred to the ICC by the U.N. Security Council, though diplomats have said permanent members China and Russia would likely veto any such move. Britain has been drafting a Security Council resolution on Myanmar, but diplomats told Reuters in December it did not include a referral to the ICC.
Legal experts say other options for an international prosecution include referral by individual U.N. member states – five Latin American states recently successfully referred Venezuela – or an ad hoc tribunal.
""DARK AGES""
Lee has been blocked from visiting Myanmar since 2017 over her vocal criticism of its treatment of the Rohingya. 
She said Myanmar authorities had turned down her latest request to visit the country. ""They responded and reminded me that they had asked the Human Rights Council to replace me so they cannot engage with me,"" she said.
The human rights record of the civilian government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has been a ""great disappointment"", she said.
Since Suu Kyi swept to power in a landslide election in 2015, 44 journalists have been arrested, according to Athan, a Yangon-based free speech group. That number includes two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, sentenced to seven years after reporting on a military-led massacre of 10 Rohingya.

""It really is alarming that Myanmar is taking this path,"" said Lee. ""After 60, 70 years of isolation now is a big chance for them to come out and now they're retreating back into the dark ages, which is very disappointing.""

775,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>",Tunnel exposes deep conflict in Italy's populist government,"By Steve Scherer and Cristiano Corvino
SAINT-MARTIN-DE-LA-PORTE, France (Reuters) - Italy's 5-Star Movement and League party were rivals going into last year's national election, became coalition partners in a populist government afterwards, and now an Alpine rail tunnel threatens to tear them apart.
The dispute over whether to forge ahead with one of Europe's most ambitious engineering projects is rooted in the divergent nature of the two anti-establishment parties and highlights their conflicting visions for Italy's future. 
The hard-right, pro-business League wants the tunnel to go ahead, as do two-thirds of Italians, according to an EMG Acqua poll last week. On the other hand, more than half of 5-Star's left-leaning and environmentally friendly supporters oppose it.
""It's striking because they are two populist forces with two very different groups of people supporting them,"" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, a founder of YouTrend, a political consultancy based in Turin, the northwestern city where trains are supposed to arrive from France after passing through the tunnel. 
A 2,400-tonne boring machine nicknamed ""Federica"" is already working around the clock more than 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) below ground on the French side of the border even though Rome is threatening to pull the plug as it reviews the project. 
The tunnel is stoking tension within the coalition because of regional and European elections in May, which could reverse the balance of power within the eight-month-old coalition and destabilize a government that manages one of the world's largest debts, which is closely monitored by financial markets. 
Polls foresee the League surging above 5-Star, which has already compromised on other major battles in recent months but appears not to want to give ground on the 8.6-billion-euro ($10 billion) tunnel.
Transport Minister and 5-Star member Danilo Toninelli told Reuters a decision would come before the elections, and 5-Star bigwig Alessandro Di Battista said the project was ""idiocy"".
In December, Italy agreed with France to freeze new contracts on the 36-mile (58 km) tunnel until completion of an Italian cost-benefit analysis by a panel of experts, which Toninelli has said should be published by the end of the month. 
""If the analysis says that we're throwing away money, only a madman would move forward,"" 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said on Monday. However, it might not prove so easy to kill the project.

FEDERICA
Deep in the bowels of the Mount Cenis (Moncenisio), geothermal energy heats the air to about 29 degrees (84 Fahrenheit). With a force equal to the power of eight Formula 1 engines, boring machine Federica rumbles and shakes as she cuts into coal-colored rock, advancing as much as 18 meters per day.
So far the joint French and Italian company - the Tunnel Euralpin Lyon Turin (TELT) - has dug more than 15 miles (25 km) inside the mountain, including four access tunnels and about 4 miles (6 km) of one of the two main passageways.
Some 800 people are employed, either directly or indirectly, TELT says, and that number will balloon to 8,000 if and when work reaches full capacity. 
Those in favor of the project, known in Italy as the TAV, say the costs of shutting it down with 25 km (15 miles) already dug could equal those of finishing it. 
""You can't turn off the boring machine, leave it there and walk away,"" said Piergiuseppe Gilli, TELT's chief of construction, who has worked on the project for 22 years.
The European Union is picking up 40 percent of the cost, which could increase to 50 percent, because it is part of a ""Mediterranean Corridor"" meant to link rail yards and ports from Spain to the Ukrainian border with Hungary.
French Transport Minister Elizabeth Borne has emphasized the ""geostrategic"" importance of the project, saying it must not lose EU funding.
Deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, who is also leader of the League, expressed his categorical support for it on Friday: ""The TAV absolutely must be done. It would cost more not to do it than to do it.""
Supporters of the Franco-Italian rail link have staged two large rallies in recent months in Turin, which is about 40 miles (65 km) from the French border. Local League politicians attended the demonstrations.
    ""It would improve Italy's links to other European countries and permit faster movement of passengers and goods,"" Turin resident Salvatore Bellomo said in the city's central square. ""This project would bring Italy into the future.""
In the past the ""No-TAV Movement"", which is also supported by far-left activists, has frequently clashed with police, and after death threats, two of TELT's top managers are under 24-hour armed guard.
The argument 5-Star makes against the project is that it is a huge waste of public money and a potential health concern for people who live near the Italian work site, where some of the rock dust could release asbestos into the air.
The money would be better spent on Italy's existing infrastructure, which is crumbling, 5-Star says, citing the collapse of a motorway bridge in August that killed 43 people. 
""The flow of goods is not expected to be large enough to justify public works of these dimensions,"" said Angelo Tartaglia, a retired professor at Turin's Polytechic University. ""It would not be profitable, and what's worse is ... the maintenance costs would be higher than the tunnel's revenue."" 
Tartaglia is on a committee of experts formed by the Turin mayor Chiara Appendino after she became one of the first 5-Star heads of a major Italian city in 2016.
The 5-Star fight against the tunnel dates back to a time when it was still trying to make its name known, and the party's founder, comic Beppe Grillo, was calling for an environmentally friendly economic model based on ""happy negative growth"". 
But being in government has forced 5-Star to shed some of its anti-establishment identity. The movement has already relented on promises to close the Ilva steel plant or shut down construction of a gas pipeline from Albania.

""These kind of reality checks are part of the nature of this government,"" consultant Pregliasco said, referring to Ilva and the pipeline. ""The difference with the tunnel is its higher symbolic value for 5-Star.""

The passage by the U.S. ships will likely be viewed in Taiwan as a sign of support from U.S. President Donald Trump's government amid growing friction between the self-ruled island and Beijing.
China considers Taiwan its own and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control. 
Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction through the waterway that separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland and that their voyage was in accordance with regulations.
It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to ""ensure the security of the seas and regional stability"".
The United States sent ships through the waterway three times last year.
Despite Chinese military technological advances that pose an increased threat to U.S. warships, the U.S. Navy has said it has not ruled out sending an aircraft carrier through the strait, something it has not done in more than 10 years. 
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China closely monitored the U.S. ships through the waters, and had ""expressed concern"" to the U.S. side, urging it to abide by the ""one China"" principle. 
China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since President Tsar Ing-wen, from the pro-independence ruling party, took office in 2016. It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years.
Beijing sent several bombers and aircraft through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a separate statement. 
A similar Chinese operation was conducted on Tuesday, the ministry said, and both were monitored closely.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in early January China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life.
Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales.

The United States recognizes only ""one China"" and has no formal ties with Taiwan, but it is bound by law to help the island defend itself and is its main source of arms.

China has said that Yang Jun, a naturalized Australian writer, who goes by the name Yang Hengjun, is being held under ""coercive measures"" - a euphemism for detention - by Beijing city's State Security Bureau and being investigated on suspicion of endangering state security.
His lawyer has said he was suspected of espionage and is being held in ""residential surveillance at a designated location"", a form of detention that allows authorities to interrogate suspects for six months without access to legal representation.
Staff from the Australian embassy in Beijing made a consular visit to Yang on Friday afternoon, the Australian ministry said on its website.
""Access to Mr Yang was provided in accordance with our bilateral consular agreement with China,"" the ministry said, adding that no details of their discussion could be provided due to privacy laws.
Australian officials said Yang was detained shortly after he flew in to the southern city of Guangzhou from New York last week.
They have also said they do not believe his detention was the result of strained relations between China and the West.
Tension has risen in recent weeks between China and some Western countries after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Australia joined international condemnation of the arrest of the Canadians, but Yang has long been in the sights of Chinese authorities.

He has criticized what he described as Chinese interference in Australia.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's governing coalition leaders on Friday cranked up pressure on European Union partners, especially the Netherlands and France, to welcome a humanitarian boat carrying 47 migrants that is being blocked from Italian ports. 
The Sea Watch 3, run by a German humanitarian group, plucked the migrants out of a rubber boat on Saturday off Libya. Since then it has been sailing through high winds and 7-metre (23 ft) waves.
With little space on board, many of the migrants are forced to stay on deck, sheltering under a tarpaulin but with little heat. 
Given the dire weather conditions, Italy's coast guard on Friday told the ship it could moor 2 km (1.2 miles) off Sicily's shore, near the city of Syracuse, but Italy continued to refuse to let it enter any port. 
""We can't wait to see them arrive, safe and sound, in other European countries. There no space (for them) in Italy,"" Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who is head of the far-right League party, said in a statement.
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, said the ship should go to either France, which he has accused of shirking its responsibilities, or the Netherlands, which is the flag flown by the Sea Watch vessel.
""I invite (Sea Watch 3) to turn its bow toward Marseille,"" Di Maio said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), referring to the port in south France. 
""It would be appropriate immediately to summon the Dutch ambassador to ask him what intentions his government has. Will it ask, along with us, that Sea Watch 3 go to Marseille, or will they be disembarked in Rotterdam?"" Di Maio said.
Separately, Salvini said he had written to the Dutch government asking it to take responsibility for the migrants. Dutch officials had no immediate comment. 
Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said the migrants' plight was worrying. ""Some of them must stay outside, on the deck, since there's not enough room inside,"" he said on Twitter.
It is the second time in a month Sea Watch has been stranded at sea with rescued migrants and no safe port. The last standoff ended after 19 days and an agreement among eight EU countries, including Italy, to take in the migrants.
Italy had allowed rescue ships to dock regularly until June of last year, when the populist government took over and closed the country's ports to them, even though boat arrivals have plunged over the past year.
The seaside cities of Palermo and Naples, among others, have said they would welcome the ship, but the central government controls who is allowed to dock in Italian ports.

Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, said during a speech on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that China was the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced authoritarian regime in the world. 
""This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies,"" Soros said.

Xi has presided over a crackdown on dissent since coming to power in 2012, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained. Dozens have been jailed. 
Soros said Xi was wielding Chinese technology companies to develop artificial intelligence and a nascent social credit system that would allow China's ""one-party state to reign supreme"".
He said U.S. President Donald Trump should drop trade disputes with other countries and focus on China, while cracking down on Chinese technology firms, such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), which could be used to assert authoritarian control. 
China has said it would create a ""social credit system"" by 2020 to reward or punish individuals and corporations, using technology to record various measures of financial credit, personal behavior and corporate misdeeds. 
The system's rollout has attracted international headlines, sparking comparisons to George Orwell's novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", with critics saying it could massively increase the ruling Communist Party's already strict control.
Some experts say the system remains in its early stages and could help tackle social problems like fraud or food security. 
The U.S. government under Trump has pursued a strategy to counter what it sees as China's growing threat to U.S. economic competitiveness and security.
That includes tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, based on U.S. findings that it is misappropriating U.S. intellectual property through forced technology transfers and other means.
A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers recently introduced bills that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei, ZTE, or other Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. 
ZTE and Huawei are viewed with suspicion in the United States because of fears their switches and other gear could be used to spy on Americans.

China has called the legislation ""hysteria"" and denies U.S. accusations of trade abuses.

DAVOS, Switzerland/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is committed to advancing relations with Japan but will step up efforts to share with the world its experience of Japanese wartime atrocities, including sexual violence against its women, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told Reuters. 
Kang said South Korea was seeking to host an international conference on sexual violence in conflict in the first half of this year.
""We feel we have a lot to contribute to the discussion because we have the history of the comfort women and the victims,"" she said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The two Asian neighbors share a bitter history stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula, the use of forced labor at Japanese companies, and the abuse of 'comfort women' - Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in its military brothels during World War Two.
""The conference is not to address (the comfort women) issue per se, but to make sure that their historical experience is not lost, and (is) registered in the international efforts to really come to terms with this issue,"" Kang said. 
The rows over wartime history have long been a stumbling block in relations between South Korea and Japan, two U.S. allies engaged in global efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
Kang said that despite a ""very difficult history"", Seoul would take a ""two-track approach"" to resolve the historical disputes while boosting cooperation on North Korea and security. 
""There is a fundamental sense of lack of justice on the part of the victims,"" Kang told Reuters. ""And as we manage the past in a way that addresses the concerns of the victims, we also have to move along these many other tracks of collaboration."" 
The feud has deepened in recent months after South Korean courts ordered Japanese firms to compensate former laborers, and Tokyo accused a South Korean destroyer of having locked a radar on a Japanese surveillance plane.
Japan maintains that the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, and has called the court rulings ""unthinkable.""
Japan requested diplomatic consultations on the issue of forced labor on Jan. 9, asking South Korea to respond within 30 days. Kang said that Seoul would reply after considering ""all elements"", based on the position that it respects the court decisions, but it has the victims ""first in mind.""
But she said the country has no intention of revisiting the 1965 diplomatic treaty, dismissing recent suggestions made in local media that South Korea may propose discussing all unresolved issues involving the treaty.
Under the deal, South Korea received a package of $300 million in economic aid and $500 million in loans from Japan in exchange for Seoul considering all pre-treaty compensation issues settled. The money was spent to rebuild its infrastructure and economy, ravaged by the 1950-53 Korean War.
South Korea, under a former conservative administration, previously agreed to refrain from raising the comfort women issue in the international community, including the United Nations, as part of a 2015 deal with Japan under which Tokyo apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9.11 million) to a fund to help them. 

Kang, who was appointed by liberal President Moon Jae-in in June 2017, has however said the 2015 pact failed to address the victims' concerns, and in November the government said it would shut down the Japanese-funded foundation.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","Lack of jobs in India drove migrants on to boat for New Zealand, say relatives","By Alasdair Pal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In a dark alleyway no wider than arms' length, a single ladies' shoe is all that remains on the boarded-up doorstep of Prabhu Dhandapani, his wife and their eight-year-old daughter. 
Prabhu, 30, was one of around 50 residents of a refugee community in New Delhi who left the capital to attempt an 7,000-mile boat journey through some of the roughest waters in the world with the aim of landing illegally in New Zealand, relatives and police said. 
He is now in custody in southern India, while his wife and daughter are missing, along with everyone else who boarded the fishing boat that police say left Munambam harbor in Kerala on Jan. 12 carrying more than 100 people.
The most likely and shortest route, though the straits between Indonesia and Australia, passes through seas where storms and typhoons are common. 
More than a dozen relatives of passengers on board the boat, that include pregnant women and young children, told Reuters they left to escape chronic unemployment in the Madangir area on the south side of New Delhi. 
""They had to leave to find jobs, to eat,"" said Prabhu's mother, Sugana. ""They have been promised work in New Zealand.""
When asked if she knew where the country was, she shook her head. 
It the first known attempt by migrants to reach New Zealand by boat from India, and their story is a reminder of the vast challenge the country faces to create jobs for the 1 million young people who enter its workforce every month. 
Boats have been setting out from South and Southeast Asia for Australia for a number of years but Indians making the trip have been relatively rare, based on Australian government statistics that show the largest numbers detained there to be asylum seekers from Iran and Afghanistan.
LONG JOURNEY
Passengers from Delhi left the capital in stages in December and early January. They checked into guesthouses near Munambam, a busy fishing port. 
They appear to have boarded the boat willingly, said a senior police official in Delhi briefed on the investigation. Their local police station in the capital had not received any missing persons' reports. 
Precise numbers on the boat - and who organized it - are unknown. One officer from Kerala investigating the case said around 100 people were on board. A second said it could be more than 200, with the remaining passengers coming from the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Police recovered more than 70 bags left behind by the migrants, said one of the officers, VG Ravindran. 
""The bags are full of dry goods and clothes, suggesting they were preparing for a long journey,"" MJ Sojan, the officer leading the investigation told Reuters. ""The people and boat are missing somewhere in the sea.""
Some passengers, including Prabhu, did not board the boat, and police traced several back to Madangir after finding identification documents in the bags left behind. He was detained by Kerala police less than 10 minutes after arriving back in Delhi, his mother said, and taken back to the state for questioning. 
Sugana said she did not know why Prabhu did not board the boat with his wife, Anandi, and eight-year-old daughter Trisha. She said he was not involved in people smuggling. 
HARD LIFE
Many of the older residents of the Tamil community in Madangir fled Sri Lanka in 1983, when a civil war erupted between the majority Sinhalese Buddhist population and the minority Tamils, an ethnic group predominantly living in south India and north and east Sri Lanka.
They settled in the area, a few miles from India's parliament building and some of the country's most expensive real estate, but which has suffered from rampant unemployment, residents said.
""If we get the chance we will also go: this is a rotten place,"" said Kanaga Lingam, a Sri Lankan refugee whose son, K. Raghu, boarded the boat with his wife and two sons.
There is anger too at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who came to power in 2014 promising to create millions of new jobs for India's young and rapidly expanding workforce. 
In fact, the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year, according to a report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) think-tank, putting Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under pressure before a general election due by May.
While the official jobless rate is only 3.5 percent, the last comprehensive labor bureau survey was in 2015-16, and many unofficial estimates say it is much higher, especially if the underemployed, who only work for a few months a year or a few days a week, are counted.
Many of those in the Tamil enclave who do work do so as daily manual laborers, a poorly-paid and unstable living. 
""If I am able I will go to Modi's house and beg at his feet to be allowed to go to another country,"" said a woman called Bumi, who like many southern Indians goes by only one name. 
""There are a hundred problems here. We have no jobs,"" said a 32-year-old man, who like many in the area declined to be named, fearing involvement in the police investigation into the boat. 
Crime is also an issue in the area, primarily theft, the Delhi police official said. 
The BJP disputes the CMIE figures on unemployment. On Thursday several cabinet minister pointed to alternative figures from Naukri, an online jobs portal, showing a pick-up in employment over the last year.
LAND OF PROMISE 
Many of those Reuters spoke to in the community, centered around a rubble- and garbage-strewn courtyard and several densely populated alleyways, said those on board the boat had been inspired by stories of Indian migrants starting new lives abroad, particularly in Australia. 
More than 600,000 Indians live in Australia, according to the latest government census, the vast majority of whom arrived legally. There are 155,000 in New Zealand.
""People who go to Australia get put in camps for three months,"" Kanaga said. ""After that they get given proper housing. Everything is taken care of.""
But few of those on the boat had passports, according to several people with relatives on board, and the reality for those arriving illegally is very different.
If the boat lands in Australia or is intercepted by its border force on the way to New Zealand, those on board face being sent back to India, or to controversial camps in the South Pacific for long-term detention. 
""If they don't have visas they would be unlawful maritime arrivals and as such they would be prevented from making an application for a further visa,"" said Melbourne-based migration lawyer David Harvey. ""They would likely be diverted to an offshore processing center.""
New Zealand has seen fewer arrivals than Australia, although it now is also trying to warn off illegal migrants arriving by boat. 
""Any attempt to reach New Zealand will put your life, and the lives of your family members, at great risk,"" said Stephen Vaughan, assistant general manager of the country's immigration department. ""There is every chance you will drown at sea."" 
But in Madangir, residents say the warnings will do little to deter such journeys. 

""We know about the dangers,"" Kanaga said. ""But it is more dangerous to live here than it is to go."" ($1 = 71.1940 Indian rupees)

Ties between Tehran and Washington took a turn for the worse following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision last May to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran.
Several Americans have been detained in Iran in recent years, mostly on security-related charges including espionage. Trump warned in 2017 that Tehran would face ""new and serious consequences"" unless all unjustly held U.S. citizens were freed.
Gholamali Sadeqi, prosecutor in the northeastern city of Mashhad, said authorities were investigating security-related accusations against Michael White, according to the official news agency Mehr.
Sadeqi also said White, a 46-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, had been arrested because of a ""private complaint"" filed against him. In the past, ""private complaints"" filed by the Revolutionary Guards or other security bodies have led to arrests of activists and closure of newspapers.
Tehran has yet to respond to the release of an American-born anchor for Iran's state-run Press TV who was detained in Washington. A U.S. court order on Thursday said she had been freed after testifying in an undisclosed federal investigation.
Iran confirmed White's arrest earlier this month after the New York Times reported that White was arrested in July while visiting his Iranian girlfriend. London-based news website IranWire has reported that White was being poorly treated in prison, but Tehran has denied this.
White's mother told the New York Times that her son, a California resident, suffers acute asthma and had undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment for a neck tumor.

The preliminary estimate for 2018 compares with 82.8 million people in 2017, it said.
The European Union's most populous country, which has enjoyed economic growth for nine consecutive years, posted net migration of up to 380,000 people in 2018, the data showed, while the birth deficit - the surplus of deaths over births - was estimated at between 150,000 and 180,000.
""Despite rising population figures the demographic aging advances,"" the statistics office said.
The net migration figure is the lowest since 2012 and sharply down from 2015, when around one million asylum seekers, mostly Muslims fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, arrived.
Germany also attracts thousands of young people from other European countries each year, who come here either to study or work. 
Demographics is a contentious issue in Germany, where many rural areas struggle with a declining population.
In contrast, many large cities are booming, pushing up real estate prices and rents.
The statistics office expects the population to shrink to 79 million by 2030, when people aged 65 or older will make up 28 percent of the population.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police armed with slingshots are taking aim at troops of monkeys that harass visitors at India's Taj Mahal. 
The marauding monkeys forage for food around the entrance to the 17th century monument in the northern city of Agra, where visitors' bags are scanned and food thrown away.
Brij Bhushan, head of the Taj Mahal security force, said police received locally-made slingshots to fend off the monkeys. 
""We found that monkeys get scared by just seeing us brandishing these slingshots,"" he told Reuters.
There are 500-700 rhesus macaques living in and around the monument. Experts say they are becoming more aggressive as an expanding city encroaches on their natural habitats.
In November, a monkey snatched a 12-day-old Indian boy from his mother outside Agra and killed him.
Taj Mahal guards have been told not to attack the monkeys but to scare them away from tourists, Bhushan said.
Built by a Mughal emperor for his wife, the Taj Mahal has 25,000 visitors daily, rising to 80,000 during the peak tourist season.

Rhesus macaques have also spread havoc in New Delhi, snatching food and mobile telephones, breaking into homes and terrorizing people in and around the Indian capital.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is weighing measures to woo farmers, small business owners and those who are less well-off, after setbacks in state elections for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party, now readying for a general election due by May.
Two opinion polls on Thursday suggested that a coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could emerge as the largest group in the election, while falling short of a majority.
That could push Modi to adopt more populist measures likely to be a drain on the economy, although his government is already at risk of breaching its fiscal deficit goals.
Here are some of the steps taken or being considered, some of which may feature in the Feb. 1 interim budget, government sources said, with their costs likely to fall on the next government.
HELP FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
On Jan. 10, India announced a change in national sales tax rules to exempt an additional two million small businesses.
From April, businesses with annual sales of up to 4 million rupees ($56,700) will be exempt from the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a concession now limited to firms with turnover of up to 2 million rupees a year.
The government is also considering offering cheap loans and free accident insurance coverage to small businesses, Reuters reported this week.
HELP FOR FARMERS
Direct fund transfers and interest-free loans for farmers are among the relief measures being considered. Such loans, from state-owned banks that will be compensated by the government, could cost 120 billion rupees a year, government sources said.
An option in place of the interest-free loans could be to give farmers sums ranging from 2,000 rupees to 4,000 rupees for every hectare of land owned, at an estimated cost of more than a trillion rupees.
The government's least favored option is farm loan waivers, such as those rolled out by the main opposition Congress party after it defeated the BJP in key farmland states in last year's state elections.
JOB RESERVATION
India aims to spend millions of dollars to boost educational places to meet a 10 percent quota recently promised to the less well-off among upper-caste Hindus and people from other religions. It already sets aside job and education quotas for its lowest social classes.
ONIONS
In December, India doubled to 10 percent its export incentives for onion farmers, after prices of the key staple plunged. The program offers credit to be used to pay taxes.
E-COMMERCE RULES
India wants to ban from Feb. 1 sales by e-commerce companies, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the Walmart-owned Flipkart Group, of products from firms in which they hold equity.
The move followed complaints by retailers and traders that big firms exploit control of inventory from affiliates and pacts on exclusive sales, thus promoting undercutting.
TAX CUTS
On Dec. 22, India slashed its sales tax for more than 20 items, from televisions to movie tickets.
The government is also considering raising the ceiling for payment of personal tax, the BJP said.

Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, is facing criminal charges in Malaysia and the United States for his role in the suspected theft of about $4.5 billion from 1MDB, a state fund founded by a former prime minister, Najib Razak. 
Police are seeking information on the whereabouts of Low's father, Low Hock Peng, his mother, Goh Gaik Ewe, and two other people to assist in the 1MDB investigation, Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement on Friday.
Authorities filed money laundering charges against both the son and the father in August 2018. 
Low Taek Jho has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Neither his nor his parents' whereabouts are known.
A spokesman for Low did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The two other people sought by police are a Singaporean woman, Shabnam Naraindas Daswani, also known as Natasha Mirpuri, and Tan Kim Loong, a Malaysian associate of Low's. 
They could not be reached for comment. 
Tan was previously charged with Low for money laundering in Malaysia, and has been named as a key figure in U.S. civil lawsuits seeking to seize more than $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds.
Authorities in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore, are investigating suspected money-laundering and graft in connection with 1MDB.
Najib, who set up the fund in 2009, was ousted in a general election in May last year.
The new prime minister, veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad, has reopened investigations into 1MDB and Najib's involvement at the fund.
Najib is facing nearly 40 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other government entities. He has consistently denied wrongdoing.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of Australians are expected to protest on Saturday as a national holiday intended to celebrate the birth of modern Australia divides the country. 
Australia Day on Jan. 26 marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the ""First Fleet"" to Sydney Cove, carrying mainly convicts and troops from Britain. 
For many indigenous Australians, who trace their lineage on the continent back 50,000 years, it is ""Invasion Day"", the start of Britain's colonization of aboriginal lands and their brutal subjugation. 
""Celebrating Australia Day on January 26th is offensive,"" said Joe Williams (NYSE:WMB), a mental health worker and former professional rugby league player.
""To celebrate an invasion which has seen our people dispossessed, displaced and oppressed for some 230 years, is plain offensive,"" he told Reuters Television.
Australia's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
While opinion polls suggest up to half the country supports changing Australia Day, the conservative government is under pressure to legally entrench Jan. 26 as a national holiday.
""We should keep the 26th of January as a special day in our calendar,"" said Nick Folkes, a painter from Sydney.
""It means respect and acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by explorers, settlers, our convicts,"" he added.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government, which faces a general election due in May, opposes any change and has moved to shore up support for the holiday.
This month it ordered local councils to hold induction ceremonies for new citizens on Australia Day and the Australian Citizenship Day holiday on Sept. 17, or have their authorization revoked.
Morrison has also pledged nearly A$7 million ($4.9 million)for a replica of explorer James Cook's HMS Endeavour, the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia in 1770.
The replica ship will circumnavigate Australia next year to mark the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's voyage.
Opposition leader Bill Shorten has criticized Morrison for spending taxpayer's money on a ""bizarre Captain Cook fetish,"" but the prime minister said it will unify Australians.
""I believe it will be a voyage of bringing Australians together,"" Morrison said in Cairns this month. ""I'm keen for it to be done very much in that spirit.""

794,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2019 01:59AM ET</span>",'Fear' and 'favor' chill newsroom at storied Japanese paper,"By Mari Saito and Ami Miyazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Early in December, dozens of journalists and editors from the Japan Times gathered for an emergency meeting in a glass-walled conference room in their brand-new 14th floor office.
On the agenda was a single, incendiary issue: the newspaper's new descriptions of how Japan compelled thousands of foreigners into military brothels and labor during World War Two.
In the past, the Japan Times described Korean workers as ""forced laborers"" and comfort women as those ""forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II."" 
But the five-sentence note published on Nov. 30 said the country's oldest English-language paper would refer to Korean workers simply as ""wartime laborers.""
The paper also said that because of the varied experiences of comfort women, it would describe them as ""women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will.""
Such terms are social flashpoints in Japan and a topic of bitter dispute with South Korea, whose government argues comfort women were clear victims of wartime abuse. 
The changes come amid simmering tensions; South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in October that Japanese companies must compensate South Koreans forced to work during the war.
The executive editor of the Japan Times, Hiroyasu Mizuno, told staff in the December meeting that he had two goals: to avoid creating the perception the paper was ""anti-Japanese,"" and to increase advertising revenue from Japanese companies and institutions. 
Some readers said the change glossed over Japan's wartime actions. 
Prominent Japanese conservatives, meanwhile, applauded the move, calling it a coup for nationalist activists agitating for English-language news outlets to change such descriptions.
In an email, Mizuno told Reuters he and senior editorial managers decided to revise the paper's descriptions to ""better reflect a more objective view of topics that are both contentious and difficult to summarize.""
He said the Nov. 30 note did not signal a change in the paper's editorial direction, adding: ""I categorically deny any accusations that The Japan Times has bowed to external pressure.""
The Japan Times has an outsized impact on how the country is perceived abroad - it is distributed in Japan with The New York Times - and is seen domestically as an unofficial style guide for other English-language outlets.
A New York Times representative said that the editorial operations of the two organizations were separate, and that the paper used precise language on the topic and would continue to do so.
Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen Japan Times employees - all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal - along with hundreds of pages of internal emails and presentation materials, show the editorial changes started taking shape when the paper changed hands in June 2017.
'ANTI-JAPANESE'
Some media critics say self-censorship is a problem in Japanese newsrooms, fed by fear of losing access, advertising revenue and subscribers.
In the past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his top aide, Yoshihide Suga, have singled out the liberal Asahi Shimbun for criticism, including over its articles on comfort women and the Fukushima disaster, some of which it later retracted, citing errors.
Suga told Reuters the government would not comment on media companies' editorial policies, including those of the Japan Times. 
Conservative groups in Japan have pushed hard to change how Japan's World War Two activities are described. 
For instance, an Australian-Japanese organization that protests comfort women statues, saying the monuments feed anti-Japanese sentiment, along with Kent Gilbert, a well-known conservative commentator and lawyer who has worked in Japan for decades, petitioned Asahi Shimbun last year to remove ""forced"" from its description of comfort women.
The paper did not amend its wording, saying in a public statement that it took care ""to use the most appropriate phrasing"" for stories. 
Similar pressure led the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun to apologize to readers in 2014 for using ""sex slaves"" to refer to comfort women in its English-language edition.
""The Yomiuri Shimbun apologizes for having used these misleading expressions,"" the paper's English site said in a statement at the time.
The chilling effect in newsrooms often comes from within the organization, experts say. 
""It's less a result of direct government pressure and more from people inside newsrooms looking to their superiors and the public,"" said Minako Beppu, a journalism professor at Hosei University who studies media censorship. ""It's things like, 'Let's not criticize them too much,' or 'Let's tone things down a bit.'""
At the Dec. 3 staff meeting, Mizuno said the changes were not political.
""I want to get rid of criticism that Japan Times is anti-Japanese,"" he said, according to a transcript and audio recording. 
He added that the decision would attract advertising. A senior manager in charge of sponsored content then said the paper had already increased government ad sales and scored an exclusive interview with Abe after dropping a column by Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University Japan, who had been writing weekly on what he saw as the Abe administration's historical revisionism. 
""From a journalistic standpoint, that's fatal, really,"" a senior Japan Times reporter responded, according to the transcript.
On Friday, South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""We regret that some Japanese media organizations have adopted terms that distort the historical facts regarding the victims of comfort women for the Japanese military, and forced labor, which is merely an attempt to sidestep the essence of the problems.""
In December, Reuters received a letter from a Japanese government official objecting to the term ""sex slave"" in a Nov. 22 article about South Korean comfort women.

Founded in 1897, the Japan Times has a circulation of just 45,000. 
After years of losses and the death of its previous owner, the paper - published under the banner ""All the news without fear or favor"" - was sold in 2017 to News2u, a PR company.
It's not unusual in Japan for new management to shift a paper's editorial stance, and readers may miss subtle changes. 
But a few months after the sale, some longtime contributors, including Kingston, were told their regular columns were being cut. 
""I got an email out of the blue saying, 'We're terminating your column,'"" Kingston said.
Mizuno said the paper was open to future submissions from Kingston, but did not say why the column was canceled. 
""We have retained commentary writers and columnists that are, when appropriate, critical of the Japanese government,"" he said in an email.
Several reporters also said they felt more editorial pressure.
In August 2017, when a local newspaper reported that Tokyo's governor would snub an annual memorial for Koreans killed by mobs after an earthquake in 1923, reporters rushed to cover the news. But the reporters said they were particularly shocked when, in an email seen by Reuters, Mizuno told staff, ""I think there is absolutely no value for us to report on this.""
A SWIFT CHANGE
A few months after the paper's exclusive sit-down with Abe in February, Mizuno tried to revise the paper's style on comfort women and other sensitive topics, presenting editors with more than 100 meticulously annotated articles and columns. 
In the notes, seen by Reuters, Mizuno objected to calling comfort women ""victims"" or mentioning that they included girls; questioned referring to Japan's occupation of Korea as ""brutal""; and criticized the paper's reporting and stories by wire services, including Reuters, as generally ""pro-Korea"" and not adequately reflecting Japan's view. 
""We're not historians or arbiters of history, nor are we judges,"" he wrote.
Ultimately, he failed to persuade others, and the matter was put on hold.
But the South Korean court ruling in October led to a swift denunciation from the Japanese government and a flurry of coverage.
Mizuno turned to senior managers and the board of directors to make broader changes, according to Japan Times employees. 
Around the same time, the ultra-conservative think tank Japan Institute for National Fundamentals called on English-language media and specifically the Japan Times to refer to plaintiffs in the Seoul case as ""wartime Korean workers,"" leaving out references to coercion.
Two weeks later, the editor's note appeared in the Japan Times.

With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
While Elizabeth, 92, did not mention Brexit explicitly in a speech to her local Women's Institute in Norfolk, the monarch said every generation faced ""fresh challenges and opportunities.""
""As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture,"" the queen said.
The comments were interpreted as a coded signal to Britain's political class. The Times' main headline read: ""End Brexit feud, Queen tells warring politicians"" while the BBC said there was no doubt the monarch was sending a message.

As head of state, the queen remains neutral on politics in public and is unable to vote though ahead of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, she made a delicately crafted plea for Scots to think carefully about their future.

But Wyllys' Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) said his seat in Brasilia will go to a substitute lawmaker who is also gay: Rio councilman David Miranda, the husband of Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald.
In a letter to the party explaining his decision to leave Brazil, Wyllys said death threats made his life unbearable and he hardly left his Rio home. His siblings and his mother had also been threatened, he said in the letter released by the PSOL.
Wyllys said in a newspaper interview that the climate of violence in Brazil, which had one of the world's worst murder rates last year, had worsened since the October election of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has disparaged gays and other minorities.
Wyllys said he was tired of living with bodyguards since the execution-style murder last year of popular Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco, a fellow PSOL member. 
""It was not Bolsonaro's election itself. It was the level of violence that has increased since he was elected,"" Wyllys told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. 
A legislative aide in Brasilia confirmed that Wyllys will not return to Brazil from his current travels in Europe.
The presidential press office declined to comment.
Wyllys told Folha that he was the target of constant death threats and defamatory campaigns on social media and got pushed in the street even with bodyguards. 
""I don't want to sacrifice myself,"" he told Folha. ""I want to take care of myself and stay alive.""
The last straw, he said, were revelations that Bolsonaro's son Flavio had employed on his Rio state assembly staff relatives of a fugitive former police officer suspected of involvement in Franco's assassination in March. 
Wyllys, 44, was a staunch advocate for gay rights and fought religious discrimination and violence against women during his two terms in Congress.
""To preserve one's threatened life is also a strategy to fight for better days,"" he said in the newspaper interview.

WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States is seeking to ensure that Venezuelan oil revenue goes to opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, and to cut off money from increasingly isolated President Nicolas Maduro, a top U.S. official said on Thursday.
Although short on details, the announcement signals that Washington is willing to go beyond traditional diplomatic measures and will seek to drain cash from Maduro's government, which is already struggling under an unprecedented economic meltdown.
Such a move would significantly strengthen the hand of Guaido, who swore himself in as interim head of state on Wednesday with the support of Washington and nations around the region.
""What we're focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate Maduro regime from the sources of his revenues,"" national security advisor John Bolton told reporters at the White House. 
""We think consistent with our recognition of Juan Guaido as the constitutional interim president of Venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate government.""
Bolton added that the process was ""very complicated"" and that officials were still studying how this would function. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Guaido did not respond to a message seeking comment.
BOLD CHALLENGE
Washington's support for Guaido prompted Maduro, Venezuela's leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. On Thursday, he said he was closing Venezuela's embassy in Washington as well as all of the country's consulates in the United States.
Guaido's swearing-in was the opposition's boldest challenge yet to the long-ruling Socialist Party and has given Maduro's adversaries an unprecedented diplomatic platform to press for change in a nation dogged by hyperinflation, rising malnutrition and political conflict. 
But Guaido now leads what amounts to a shadow government disavowed by the armed forces and with no influence over day-to-day administration such as importing and distributing food and medicine.
The 35-year-old industrial engineer said he had spoken on Thursday by telephone with supportive heads of state from around the world. 
""I just received a phone call from (Spain's Prime Minister) Pedro Sanchez and was able to describe the struggle we are leading together with all of Venezuela, to achieve a transition government and hold free elections,"" Guaido wrote via Twitter. 
His ascent was greeted with excitement by investors holding Venezuela and state oil company PDVSA bonds, which hit their highest level since 2017 despite being almost entirely in default.
Concerns about potential disruption of Venezuelan crude supplies gave support to global oil prices.
Oil revenues are crucial to the already crumbling Venezuelan economy and routing that money away from Maduro as the United State seeks to do would be a serious blow.
WHO IS LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT?
Guaido took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5 with a call for the armed forces to recognize Maduro as a ""usurper"" after his May 2018 re-election, widely viewed as fraudulent. 
Backing for him has come principally from the Western hemisphere. Venezuelan allies including Russia and Turkey - both important commercial partners - criticized Guaido's rise as a sign of U.S. interference.
The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Maduro's government, noted that Venezuelans had ""massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny,"" but stopped short of recognizing Guaido.
Maduro, in a rambling speech, dismissed Guaido's inauguration and said he himself remained the country's legitimate leader. 
He has relied extensively on the military to maintain power amid annual inflation of nearly 2 million percent and an exodus of Venezuelan refugees into neighboring countries.
Guaido has said Maduro's Jan. 10 inauguration to a second six-year term amounted to a usurpation of power. The vote was boycotted by Venezuela's main opposition parties, with Maduro's two most popular rivals banned from running and Socialist Party aggressive campaigning opponents called vote-buying.
Guaido and allies argue that the presidency is vacant as a result and that the constitution calls for the head of congress to assume the interim presidency in such a situation.
That still leaves Guaido struggling against a state unwilling to recognize him and security forces that could jail him, as they did his mentor Leopoldo Lopez - who is under house arrest for leading anti-Maduro protests in 2014.
""Can he name ministers? Ministers of air? Phantom ministers?,"" asked Maduro during a speech before the Supreme Court. ""Is he going to name commanders of military units? Will the armed forces obey his command? Never."" 
Protesters clashed with security forces on Wednesday night around the country and in both affluent and working class areas of Caracas, with some demonstrations spilling over into looting.
A total of 14 people have been killed in violence linked to this week's protests, according to local rights groups.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 07:49PM ET</span>","'El Chapo' trial reveals drug lord's love life, business dealings","By Brendan Pierson and Daina Beth Solomon
(Reuters) - On a typical day, Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman would wake at noon and make calls while strolling under the trees in the mountains of his native Sinaloa state, where he was in hiding, a witness recently testified at the kingpin's trial.
The infamous gangster's personal life and business dealings have gone on public display since mid-November at a courthouse in New York, where Guzman faces 17 criminal counts and a possible life sentence. 
U.S. prosecutors, who say Guzman amassed a $14 billion fortune by bribery, murder and smuggling drugs, have bolstered their case by calling to the stand law enforcement officers as well as Guzman's former associates, including one who says she was his lover and another whose brother was among his top allies.
The prosecution may rest as early as Monday, turning the case over to Guzman's defense lawyers, who claim the 61-year-old whose nickname means ""Shorty"" had a smaller role in the Sinaloa Cartel than prosecutors claim.
Here are some of the most colorful tales from recent weeks in the courtroom:
HIS OWN WORDS
- Guzman's voice was ""sing-songy"" with a ""nasally undertone,"" said FBI agent Steven Marston. In one recorded call, Guzman tells an associate, ""Don't be so harsh ... take it easy with the police."" The partner responds: ""You taught us to be a wolf."" 
- Text messages between Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel, often turned to family matters. ""Our Kiki is fearless,"" Guzman wrote in one, referring to one of their daughters. ""I'm going to give her an AK-47 so she can hang with me."" 
- After Coronel said she saw a suspicious car, Guzman wrote to her, ""You go ahead and lead a normal life. That's it."" Later he reminds her: ""Make sure you delete everything after we're done chatting.""
LOVERS AND BUSINESS
- Multiple ""wives"" visited Guzman when he was hiding in Sinaloa, said Alex Cifuentes, a former close partner. 
- Lucero Sanchez Lopez, a former Mexican lawmaker, told jurors she once had a romantic relationship with Guzman, who sent her to buy and ship marijuana. ""I didn't want for him to mistrust me because I thought he could also hurt me,"" she said. ""I was confused about my own feelings over him. Sometimes I loved him and sometimes I didn't.""
- Agustina Cabanillas, a partner of Guzman's who called him ""love,"" set up drug deals by passing information between Guzman and others. In one message, Cabinillas called Guzman a ""jerk"" who was trying to spy on her. ""Guess what? I'm smarter than him,"" she wrote.
HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION
- Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel fed bribes, some in the millions of dollars, to Mexican officials at every level, said Jesus Zambada, the brother of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, who worked alongside El Chapo and is still at large. 
- Beneficiaries included a high-ranking police official who fed Guzman information on police activities ""every day,"" said Miguel Angel Martinez, a former cartel manager. 
- Guzman once paid $100 million to former President Enrique Pena Nieto, Cifuentes said. Pena Nieto has denied taking any bribes.
- When imprisoned in Mexico in 2016, Guzman bribed a national prison official $2 million to be transferred to a different facility, but the move was unsuccessful. 
MURDER
- After a rival cartel member declined to shake Guzman's hand, he ordered the man killed, fueling a war between the cartels, Zambada said.
- When assassins reporting to Guzman killed a police official who worked for a rival, Zambada said, they lured him out of his house by pretending they had hit his son with a car.
- Guzman ordered Cifuentes to kill the cartel communications expert after learning he was cooperating with the FBI. But Cifuentes said he was unable to carry out the hit because he did not know the man's last name. 
- When Damazo Lopez Nunez, a top lieutenant to Guzman, told his boss that a Mexican mayor wanted them to ""remove"" a troublesome police officer, Guzman told him they should do her the favor because the mayor was a favorite for an upcoming state election, Lopez testified. He said Guzman told him to make the killing look like revenge from a gang member.
- Lopez also said Guzman's sons killed a prominent reporter in Sinaloa because he published an article about cartel infighting against their wishes.
- One of Guzman's former bodyguards, Isaias Valdez Rios, said he watched his boss personally kill three rival cartel members. Guzman shot one of them and ordered his underlings to bury the man while he was gasping for air. On another occasion, Guzman tortured two men for hours before shooting them each in the head and ordering their bodies tossed into a flaming pit.
SAFE HOUSES AND ESCAPES 
- For a period of Guzman's time as a fugitive in Sinaloa in northern Mexico, his posse lived in ""humble pine huts"" with tinted windows, satellite televisions and washer-dryers, Cifuentes said. About 50 guards formed three rings around the homes to keep watch.
- Guzman escaped into a tunnel hidden beneath a bathtub when U.S. agents raided one of his homes in 2014, said Sanchez, his lover. She followed Guzman, who was completely naked, into the passage, feeling water trickle down her legs. ""It was very dark and I was very scared,"" she said.

- Guzman's wife helped her husband tunnel out of a Mexican prison in 2015 by passing messages to his associates, Lopez testified. She unsuccessfully tried to help him duplicate the escape when he was captured the next year.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The head of a United Nations mission tasked with overseeing a peace deal in Yemen's Hodeidah port city plans to step down next month and will be replaced with a Danish official, U.N. diplomats said on Thursday.
Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert arrived in Hodeidah late last month to lead an advance team of monitors observing a ceasefire and redeployment of forces agreed by the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government forces. 
Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United Nations plans to replace Cammaert next month with Danish Major General Michael Anker Lollesgaard, who led a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali in 2015 and 2016. 
Lollesgaard - who, like Cammaert, will report to U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths - will oversee boosting the monitoring mission to up to 75 observers, a move that was authorized by the Security Council earlier this month.
It was not immediately clear why Cammaert was stepping down.
""As far as we know he is only resigning because he said he wouldn't do it very long,"" said a senior U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The ceasefire - agreed by the warring parties at talks in Sweden last month - has largely held but sporadic skirmishes have flared. The United Nations has struggled to implement the withdrawal of forces from both sides.
""If anything the ceasefire has held in substance longer than I think we might have thought, but it's obviously not easy, and it's very challenging ... because the parties have different interpretations of what was agreed in Stockholm,"" said the diplomat.
An armored car in Cammaert's convoy was hit by a bullet last week as he was leaving a meeting with representatives of the government of Yemen. No-one was injured and the United Nations said it did not know who fired the bullet.
The truce has averted a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and vital aid supplies. It is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis facing severe hunger in the poorest Arabian Peninsula country.
A military coalition led by neighboring Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back government forces. The U.N. and Western countries have criticized the coalition for killing a large number of civilians, including children.

The Gulf states accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, a charge Tehran and the group deny.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Protests raged across Sudanese cities on Thursday and another demonstrator died in the most widespread rallies of anti-government unrest that began last month. 
The 24-year-old man died from his wounds in Omdurman, a city across the Nile from the capital Khartoum, where crowds were railing against Sudan's three-decade ruler Omar al-Bashir.
That took the official death toll from unrest since Dec. 19 to 29, a government investigatory committee spokesman, Amer Mohamed Ibrahim, said.
Rights groups put the total at more than 40.
Trouble raged into the night in Omdurman, with smoke billowing over a street barricaded by steel poles, burning tires and tree branches.
In Khartoum, security forces fired tear gas at protesters in various neighborhoods, witnesses said. At night, smoke wafted over Khartoum, fires burned and a main street was blocked.
There were also protests in the eastern cities of Port Sudan and al-Qadarif, where hundreds gathered in the main market area, chanting ""Down, that's it! Freedom, freedom.""
Triggered by a worsening economic crisis, protests calling for Bashir to step down have spread into the most sustained challenge yet to his rule.
The opposition Sudanese Professionals' Association, a union group that has led calls for demonstrations, had urged protesters to rally from early afternoon and march to Bashir's palace on the banks of the Nile.
The group said on its social media sites that protesters had gathered in cities including Madani and Sennar south of Khartoum as well as smaller towns.
Many protests were reported in Gezira state and witnesses said demonstrators had blocked the main road in al-Nuba district, also south of Khartoum.
Security forces have used tear gas, stun grenades and live ammunition to disperse demonstrations, as well as arresting hundreds of protesters and opposition figures.

Authorities have blamed the unrest on ""infiltrators"" and foreign agents, and said they are taking steps to resolve Sudan's economic problems.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's new far-right government on Thursday gave hundreds more public servants the power to keep official records from the public for decades by labeling them ""secret"" and ""ultra-secret.""
Vice President Hamilton Mourao, standing in while President Jair Bolsonaro was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, signed the decree expanding exceptions within the 2011 transparency law.
Handed down as Bolsonaro declared a new era of transparency in Brazilian politics and business at Davos, the decree is likely to put more public records out of the reach of civic groups, journalists and ordinary citizens. 
""You need to have a balance between security and transparency,"" Mourao told reporters after the decree was published. ""This just reduces bureaucracy when you classify secret documents.""
""This decree is a step backward with respect to transparency, access to information and social control, and this decree simply must be revoked,"" said Gil Castello Branco, head of government transparency group Contas Abertas.
    The move modifies Brazil's 2011 Access to Information Law, passed to guarantee access to local, state and federal government records in the name of strengthening democracy.
The law created exceptions to protect highly sensitive materials, including ""ultra-secret"" information, which is withheld from the public for 25 years. Previously, the designation could only be made by the president, vice president, cabinet-level officials, military commanders and heads of permanent diplomatic and consular missions abroad. 
The new decree allows politically appointed civil servants, agency heads and top executives at public companies to make that designation. The decree also vastly expanded the circle of officials who can make the ""secret"" classification, which seals records for 15 years.
In total, the government gave more than 1,000 public servants greater discretion in shielding government activities from public view, according to Marina Atoji, who heads the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism.
""One way to guarantee that secretive classifications will be the exception is by limiting how many people have the power to make them. By radically expanding the number of people, this decree weakens that guarantee,"" said Atoji.

Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, has embraced an antagonistic relationship with the press and non-government organizations on the campaign trail and now in office, disparaging unfriendly outlets as ""fake news"" and threatening to cut public advertising in specific newspapers.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 03:39PM ET</span>",Pope says killing of women has become 'plague' in Latin America,"By Philip Pullella and Diego Oré
PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Latin America's leaders on Thursday to shun corruption and tackle gang violence, drug trafficking and the killing of women, which he said had become a ""plague"" in his native continent.
Francis, on the first full day of his trip to Panama for a Catholic youth festival, also addressed migration for the second straight day, saying more had to be done to overcome fears and suspicions because most migrants were seeking a better life for their families.
In a meeting with bishops from Central America, Francis said many young people found themselves ""boxed in and lacking opportunities, amid highly conflictual situations with no quick solution: domestic violence, the killing of women - our continent is experiencing a plague in this regard - armed gangs and criminals, drug trafficking ....""
At least 2,795 women were victims of femicide in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2017, according to government data provided to the UN’s Latin American economic commission, ECLAC.
In El Salvador this phenomenon is particularly acute, with a rate of 10.2 femicides per 100,000 women in 2017, ECLAC said.
The pope said families had been ""broken by an economic system that did not prioritize persons and the common good but made speculation its 'paradise'.""
The Vatican issued a statement saying the pope was following events in Venezuela.
In a separate address to Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and the diplomatic corps, Francis said the continent's young people were demanding that their political leaders live honestly, transparently, simply, and ""be opposed to all forms of corruption"".
Last year, a Transparency International report on corruption in Latin America showed that more than half of people surveyed in 20 countries believed their government was failing to address corruption and one in three said they had to pay a bribe for public services. 
Francis praised those in the Latin American Church, who, like assassinated Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, had tried to keep the truth alive ""in the face of injustice, the spread of poverty, and the abuse of power"".
Romero, a champion of the poor, became a human rights icon in Latin America when he was killed by a right-wing death squad in 1980 while he was saying Mass. He was made a saint last year.
Romero’s path to sainthood had stalled under two previous popes, reflecting concerns by some bishops in Latin America and the Vatican that he was overly political. But Francis speeded it up after his election as the first Latin American pope in 2013.
In the past, Francis criticized bishops who spoke badly of Romero even after his assassination, saying they had defamed and slandered him. On Thursday, Francis said Romero's name had become ""a dirty word"" for some. 

Francis told Reuters in June he had wanted to make a stop in nearby El Salvador during his Panama visit to pray at Romero's tomb. Francis later decided to make a longer trip to El Salvador sometime in the future.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions told Reuters on Thursday she will travel to Turkey next week to head an ""independent international inquiry"" into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at its consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2, provoking an international outcry. 
Earlier on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was time for an international investigation and that President Tayyip Erdogan had ordered preparations to be made.
""I will be heading an independent international inquiry into the killing of Saudi journalist Mr. Jamal Khashoggi, commencing with a visit to Turkey from 28 January to 3 February 2019,"" independent U.N. investigator Agnes Callamard said in an email reply to Reuters in Geneva.
Callamard said that she would evaluate the circumstances of the crime, and ""the nature and the extent of states' and individuals' responsibilities for the killing"".
""My findings and recommendations will be reported to the U.N. Human Rights Council at the June 2019 session,"" she said.
The inquiry was being conducted at her request and three experts would accompany her, with forensic expertise amongst other skills, she said, declining to name them for now.
There was no immediate word on whether the team had sought access to Saudi Arabia.
A Saudi public prosecutor's spokesman said last year that 21 Saudis were taken into custody in relation to the case, 11 of whom have been indicted and referred to trial. Earlier this month the prosecutor said it was seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 detained suspects. 
Callamard, a French academic who is director of the Columbia Global Freedom of Expression initiative at Columbia University in New York, reports to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva and has a global mandate to investigate executions.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 02:07PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Syrian Kurdish YPG expects negotiations with Damascus soon,"By Rodi Said
QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia believes talks with the government over the future of the northeast region will begin in days after a ""positive"" reaction from Damascus.
Any deal between the YPG and President Bashar al-Assad's state could piece together the two biggest chunks of a nation splintered by eight years of conflict.
Dialogue attempts have revived in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops from the Kurdish-led region.
""There are attempts to carry out negotiations ... the Syrian government stance was positive,"" the YPG commander Sipan Hemo told Reuters. ""We believe they will start in the coming days."" 
In a voice recording sent from his representatives late on Wednesday, Hemo said U.S. moves to withdraw were over-hasty and could not happen while the battle against Islamic State militants still rages. 
Syrian Kurdish leaders have sought Russian mediation for talks with Assad's state, hoping to safeguard their autonomous region when U.S. troops currently backing them pull out. 
They fear an attack by neighboring Turkey, which has threatened to crush the YPG.
On a recent visit, U.S. envoy James Jeffrey talked to him and other officials about both satisfying Turkey and protecting northern Syria, Hemo said.
U.S. arming of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which the YPG spearheads, has infuriated NATO ally Turkey. Ankara sees the Syrian Kurdish fighters as indistinguishable from the Kurdish PKK movement that has waged an insurgency inside Turkey. 
The Kurdish-led authority that runs much of north and east Syria presented a road map for an agreement with Assad in recent meetings with his key ally Russia.
Hemo said there had been no direct talks with the state since, but Damascus had received the proposal, which focused on preserving Kurdish and minority rights, including education, as well as self-rule.
Kurdish forces and Damascus have mostly avoided combat during the war. Assad, who has vowed to recover the entire country, has long opposed Kurdish ambitions for a federal Syria.
Short-lived talks between the two sides last summer went nowhere. 
Government officials were not immediately available for comment, but a minister last week expressed optimism.
""LONG WAR WITH DAESH""
Mixed messages from Washington have clouded Trump's abrupt announcement last month, which sparked concern among Western allies. The 2,000 American forces are still deployed in the SDF region, rich in oil, farmland and water - the biggest chunk of Syria outside state rule. 
""Implementing this (U.S.) decision to withdraw practically is not possible in the near term,"" Hemo said.
SDF fighters are now battling Islamic State remnants in an enclave in eastern Syria, after seizing vast swathes of land from the jihadists with U.S. help.
""Daesh is headed towards demise. There are many sleeper cells and there will be a long war with Daesh in this region,"" Hemo said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. 
He said any safe zone in northeast Syria, which Trump mentioned on Twitter, should be under U.N. auspices. The SDF has welcomed the possibility but said any such zone must keep Turkey out. 
""We want to be on good ties as neighbors, but the Turkish state does not accept this,"" Hemo said. ""If Turkey attacks our region, we will respond appropriately."" 
Ankara has drawn on Syrian rebel proxies to help fight the YPG in the northwest before and has vowed to march further east. 

Turkey's foreign minister said on Thursday his country has the capacity to create a safe zone in Syria but would not exclude other states that want to cooperate.

GAZA (Reuters) - Gaza's dominant Hamas group refused to let Qatar send in $15 million of aid on Thursday, part of a tortuous standoff involving Israel and rival Palestinian factions that has left thousands of civil servants there short of pay.
In November Qatar began a six-month, $150 million program to fund the wages and shipments of fuel for power generation in Gaza.
The staggered payments, widely seen as a Qatari bid to increase its regional role, need Israel's permission to get through - an involvement that has riled many among Hamas' Islamist leadership. 
Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, said on Thursday Israel had broken previous agreements brokered by Qatar and Egypt. He said Hamas had told Qatar's ambassador, Mohammed Al-Emadi, that it refused the money ""in response to the occupation policy"".
Gaza economist Mohammad Abu Jayyab said that he believed Qatar had told Hamas leaders that Israel had put new conditions over the mechanism for paying out the money. Israeli officials refused to comment.
POLITICAL FOOTBALL
The civil servants have also become a symbol of a bitter and protracted power struggle between Hamas, which has its power base in Gaza, and the western-backed Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.
The workers were hired by Hamas after it unexpectedly won elections in 2006 and seized military control of Gaza the next year.
But after years of Israeli-led blockades, successive wars and the continued failure of internal reconciliation efforts, Hamas was left with little in its coffers. With Hamas hardly able to pay its own employees, and Abbas refusing to, the workers were caught in the middle.
Qatar's intervention angered Abbas, whose strategy has been to pressure Hamas back to the negotiating table by slashing salaries, thereby worsening economic conditions in Gaza.
The Qatari largesse has also posed problems for Israel's government, which detests Hamas but does not want to see Gaza's economic problems spill over into violence against Israelis. 

Israel initially blocked the latest Qatari transfer, then relented on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government accepted a ""recommendation"" by the Israeli military to let the money in.

There have been no signs of life since the boy, Julen, fell into the borehole as his family walked through a private estate in Totalan in southern Spain. Rescuers found the well was blocked with earth, raising fears soil had collapsed onto the child.
""Members of the Mines Rescue Brigade sent from Asturias (region) have just accessed the vertical well to start excavation ... in the search for Julen,"" said regional government representative Alfonso Celis at the site.
Miners working in rotating shifts will dig a 4-meter passage with picks and pneumatic hammers from the bottom of the shaft towards the borehole, which is 100 meters (300 feet) deep and just 25 cm wide.
Children and families have been holding candlelight vigils across Spain in support of the missing boy and of the massive rescue operation, even as hopes of finding him alive have faded with each passing day.
Engineers and miners have worked for 10 days in a row but have run into various technical problems while drilling a shaft parallel to the well.
""No miner is left in a mine, and Julen is now considered a miner,"" Juan Lopez Escobar, one of the engineers in charge of the rescue operation, was quoted as saying by EFE news agency. ""Whatever may have happened, a miner is always pulled out.""
He told reporters earlier that digging the horizontal passage would be the most dangerous part of the effort. 

El Pais reported that Julen's parents suffered another tragedy in 2017 when their three-year-old son died suddenly after suffering a cardiac arrest while walking along a beach.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, a figurehead of Scotland's independence movement, denied committing any crimes on Thursday after he appeared in court charged with multiple sex offences including two counts of attempted rape.
Scottish prosecutors said Salmond, 64, had also been charged with nine counts of sexual assault, two counts of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace. 
""I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever,"" Salmond, widely credited with helping push support for secession to record levels, told reporters outside Edinburgh Sheriff Court following a five-minute hearing which media and public were not allowed to attend. 
""I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court,"" he added. ""I would love to say a great deal more but I've got to observe the rules of the court and in court is where I will state my case.""
Salmond was released on bail and it was not disclosed when further hearings would take place.
The combative politician led the devolved Scottish government for seven years until 2014. As leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he helped drive growing support for Scottish independence but Scotland ultimately voted to stay part of the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum. 
Last year, Salmond took legal action against the Scottish devolved government now led by his successor and protege Nicola Sturgeon over how it handled a complaints process against him in a sexual harassment case.
Salmond, who denied any wrongdoing, won a judicial review earlier this month on how that case was handled by the Scottish government when it conceded it had acted unlawfully in probing the harassment claims.
The case pitted the two most popular figures in the Scottish independence movement against one another, and some commentators believe it could weaken Sturgeon's leadership just as she seeks to start a new drive for secession amid the chaos of Britain's exit from the European Union.
A dispute has continued to simmer between two factions in the SNP around what Sturgeon knew about the case and when. An inquiry by the Scottish parliament is under way to discover more.

Sturgeon said the news of Salmond's charges would come as a shock to many, but that tight judicial requirements and the sensitivity of the case meant she could not comment further.

Yanukovich fled to Russia in 2014 following street protests against his rule. His successor, Petro Poroshenko, has adopted a pro-Western foreign policy, reversing Yanukovich's tilt towards Moscow.
""With his deliberate illegal actions, Yanukovich committed a crime against the foundations of the national sovereignty of Ukraine, namely state treason"", judge Vladyslav Deviatko said.
The judge said Yanukovich sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 1, 2014, asking him to use Russian army and police forces to restore order in Ukraine.
""With his deliberate actions, Yanukovich committed a crime against peace, namely aiding in the conduct of an aggressive war,"" judge Deviatko said.
Yanukovich left Ukraine after three months of protests during which more than 100 demonstrators were killed in clashes in the Ukrainian capital.
Yanukovich has previously denied the allegations made by prosecutors and blamed armed nationalist radicals for fomenting violence in the 2014 Maidan protests that prompted him to flee.
Yanukovich's lawyers said they would appeal the judgement.

The issue of preserving the pro-European vector of development will be one of the key debates in the upcoming presidential elections in which the current president Poroshenko and former associates of Yanukovich will most likely take part.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 11:32AM ET</span>",New Congo president Tshisekedi calls for unity after divisive election,"By Giulia Paravicini
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi called for national reconciliation on Thursday as he became Democratic Republic of Congo's president, succeeding Joseph Kabila in Congo's first transfer of power via an election in 59 years of independence.
""We want to build a strong Congo, turned toward its development in peace and security,"" he said to cheers from thousands of supporters on the lawn of the presidential palace. ""A Congo for all, in which everyone has a place."" 
The pageantry of the ceremony was briefly interrupted when Tshisekedi was taken ill during his inaugural address and had to sit down. But he returned to the podium moments after a brief pause, saying he was exhausted by the election and the emotion of the moment.
His spokesman later told Reuters that his bulletproof vest had been too tight. 
Tshisekedi's victory in the Dec. 30 election was marred by accusations he struck a backroom deal with the outgoing president to deny victory to another opposition candidate. Kabila and Tshisekedi's camps reject those allegations. 
Tshisekedi, wearing a blue suit and dark glasses, took the oath of office before his supporters, government officials and foreign ambassadors. 
However, in a sign of lingering doubts about the vote's credibility, Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta was the only foreign head of state present. 
Still, the imagery of one leader handing off the presidency to another as Kabila wrapped the presidential sash around his successor was striking in a country where previous power transfers have resulted only from coups, assassination or rebellion.
In his address, Tshisekedi called for ""a reconciled Congo"" following a contentious election that saw him narrowly defeat another opposition leader, Martin Fayulu, and Kabila's hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. 
DISPUTED RESULT
Fayulu said he won the election by a landslide, a claim backed by tallies from Congo's Catholic Church, which deployed 40,000 observers to the polls.
He told Reuters on Thursday that he would never work with Tshisekedi. ""Felix has to start by telling the truth,"" Fayulu said. ""He's not the president-elect. He is the president appointed by Kabila.""
Many African and Western countries, wary that a dispute could reignite unrest in the volatile central African country, have recognized Tshisekedi after Congo's highest court dismissed Fayulu's fraud complaints.
Tshisekedi's late father, Etienne, was one of Kabila's fiercest political rivals, losing to him in the 2011 presidential election. Supporters of his Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party were among the dozens killed by security forces in protests in response to Kabila's refusal to step down on time. 
At Thursday's ceremony, UDPS supporters dressed all in white cheered soldiers as they marched along the palace lawn, and longtime political foes sat together in the tribune. 
""I am happy today because Felix will change the country. He will give children free education and people food,"" said Nsangaa Tshibula, 39, whose white gown was decked in glittery beads. 
But Tshisekedi faces widespread suspicion outside the UDPS that his election win came through a secret deal with Kabila that will see the outgoing president continue to pull the strings behind the scenes. 
BREAK WITH THE KABILA YEARS?
Congolese sources in contact with senior government officials told Reuters that Fayulu won the election decisively, but that top officials ordered the electoral commission to award the vote to Tshisekedi after he struck a deal with Kabila.
Tshisekedi and Kabila's camps deny that, but Tshisekedi will find it difficult to shake Kabila's influence regardless. 
During his 18 years in power, Kabila installed loyalists throughout the federal bureaucracy, and his ruling coalition won a resounding majority in legislative elections, meaning Tshisekedi's prime minister will come from its ranks.
Kabila has refused to rule out a fresh run for president in 2023, when he will no longer be constrained by term limits.
That has left many Congolese wondering whether Tshisekedi's presidency will mark a meaningful break with the Kabila years, during which the economy grew at a healthy clip on the back of surging copper and cobalt production but failed to significantly dent endemic poverty. 
Congo remains deeply unstable years after the official end of a 1998-2003 regional war in the eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi that led to millions of deaths, most from hunger and disease. 
Dozens of militia continue to ravage those areas. Three days of ethnic violence last month in the normally peaceful west also killed nearly 900 people, according to the United Nations.
During the election campaign, Tshisekedi vowed to move the government for at least three months to the city of Goma, on the border with Rwanda, in a bid to reassert state control over that part of the country. 

But analysts say his perceived lack of legitimacy in some quarters after the disputed election could embolden armed challenges to his government.

The Jan. 23 letter did not provide the value of the deal, citing a 2014 court ruling that exempts such disclosures if it could harm companies' ability to compete.
Approval of the sale comes amid a halt in all weapons sales to Qatar's rival Saudi Arabia imposed by Berlin after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
RAM is a ship-based rolling airframe missile that protects naval vessels against missiles, aircraft, helicopters and other ships. The sale also includes 85 dual-mode radar and infrared seekers that guide the missile into its target.
The RAM system is manufactured and marketed by RAM-System GmBH, a joint venture of Germany's Diehl and European missile maker MBDA, and U.S. arms maker Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co. MBDA is jointly owned by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo.
The missile system will be exported to Qatar via Italy, while the seekers will be exported through the United States, Altmaier said in his letter.
Klaus Ernst, a member of the radical Left opposition party, blasted the German government's decision, given continued concerns about security and human rights in the Gulf region.
""It is irresponsible of the German government to continue to approve arms sales to crisis regions,"" Ernst said.
Germany last year announced plans to expand ties with Qatar, which pledged to invest 10 billion euros in the German economy.

The RND newspaper chain, which first reported the latest arms sale to Qatar, said the RAM system had previously been sold by Germany to Egypt, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.

Opposition politicians accuse John McCallum of political interference in the matter and insist he be fired. 
After Huawei Technologies Co Ltd chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested on a U.S. warrant last month, China detained two Canadian men on national security grounds.
""Our focus is entirely on getting those Canadians home safe ... and making a change would not help release those Canadians a day sooner,"" Trudeau told reporters in New Brunswick when asked whether he would recall or punish McCallum.
McCallum's comments to Chinese-language media, which were broadcast on Wednesday, were the most explicit sign yet from a Canadian official that Meng might not be extradited.
""Canada will always remain a country where the rule of law is at the very core of the judicial system ... which of course includes the capacity of people to defend themselves,"" Trudeau said in televised remarks.

McCallum, like Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, has stressed the importance of the long-term relationship with China. Before the dispute erupted last month Ottawa had been debating the merits of opening free trade talks with China.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - North Korea must make concrete pledges toward curbing its nuclear weapons program, such as dismantling its main nuclear complex and allowing international inspections to confirm the process, when leader Kim Jong Un meets U.S. President Donald Trump as soon as next month, South Korea's foreign minister said.
Kang Kyung-wha told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that she is optimistic that North Korea will agree to concrete steps toward abandoning its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, developed in violation of United Nations resolutions.
""The (North Korean) leader has promised to his people many times that 'I’m going to take this country toward economic development'. He has to deliver that, and he’s not going to get the kind of significant assistance unless he takes concrete steps toward denuclearization and somehow eases the sanctions regime,"" she said on Thursday.
""Given the strong political will on the part of the top leaders of the two sides... I think we will see concrete results.""
Trump and Kim held a historic first summit in Singapore in June. The White House said last week a second summit would be held in late February but did not say where.
On Thursday, North Korean state media said that Kim had ordered working-level preparations for his meeting with the American president, and that he ""will believe"" in Trump's ""positive way of thinking.""
Kang said there was ""broad agreement"" between Pyongyang and Washington on the timing and that a date could be announced ""very soon.""
Kim pledged at the first summit to work toward ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"", but discussions over how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered.
Washington is demanding concrete action toward denuclearization, such as a full disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities, before agreeing to key goals of Pyongyang - easing tough international sanctions and declaring an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War.
The two Koreas are technically still at war because the conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.
""COMPREHENSIVE DEAL""
Kang said she had been heartened by a recent flurry of diplomacy, which included a visit to Washington by Pyongyang's top nuclear negotiator to meet with Trump last week, and working-level talks held on the sidelines of a conference in Sweden over the weekend.
""I think the Sweden meeting was very useful,"" she said. ""So I feel much better about the situation.""
Despite the slow pace of talks since the June summit, North Korea and the United States could still reach a ""comprehensive"" denuclearization deal that includes Pyongyang declaring the extent of its nuclear arsenal, Kang said.
""Full disclosure has to be a part of the process,"" she said, while noting that the implementation of any comprehensive plan would be ""step by step"", with each side making corresponding concessions.
Asked about possible concrete steps North Korea could commit to in the next U.S. summit, Kang said Pyongyang for example could follow through on its earlier suggestions that it could shut its Yongbyon nuclear complex, as well as abolish key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts.
During his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last September, Kim said North Korea would allow experts to watch the closure of its missile engine testing site and launch pad in the northwestern town of Tongchang-ri. Should there be corresponding action from Washington, the North suggested it could also permanently disclose the Yongbyon facility.
""I think we need to take that word, and make sure that that progresses,"" Kang said.
She said North Korea has yet to take steps that would warrant lifting international sanctions, but that Washington could offer several incentives short of sanctions relief.
""We’ve been in close consultations with the U.S. at all levels to see what these steps could be – a big part of this would be security guarantees to North Korea,"" Kang said.
South Korea has proposed that the United States sign a declaration formally ending the technical state of war, increase humanitarian aid, and establish U.S.-North Korea liaison offices, Kang said.

""If we do see real steps that assure us that North Korea is definitely on the denuclearization track, I think we can start thinking about sanctions relief,"" she said. ""But before that, there are many other things that we can do.""

Security forces have been cracking down on violent demonstrations that erupted last week after President Emmerson Mnangagwa decreed a sharp increase in the price of fuel.
Rights groups say a dozen people have died in the unrest, though police put the figure at three.
In a echo of tactics used during the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe, soldiers have been accused of night raids, and beating residents and activists, in the townships.
Zimbabwe National Army spokesman Alphios Makotore said those involved were not bona fide soldiers.
""The Zimbabwe National Army has noted with concern allegations of misconduct and acts of violence by people purporting to be members of the organization,"" he said.
""The actions by these bogus elements have subsequently put the image of the organization into disrepute,"" his statement added, urging residents to report violations to military police.
Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe after a de facto coup in November 2017 and promised to break with his strong-arm politics, promised this week to investigate security services' actions against protesters. 
He wants dialogue with churches, civil society and the opposition. 
Soldiers continued to patrol in central Harare on Thursday.
Zimbabwe's Human Rights Commission has accused security forces of systematic torture. The opposition says it fears soldiers are able to shoot and kill without being held accountable, after an official inquiry said the army shot civilians to quell post-election violence last August.
With inflation at its highest since 2008 and a shortage of cash in circulation eroding spending power, the fragile state of the economy is at the heart of the country's political troubles.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>","Eight years after uprising, Egyptians say freedoms have eroded","By Mohamed Abdellah and Mahmoud Mourad
CAIRO (Reuters) - Everyday at sunset, Ahmed Maher, one of Egypt's best known activists, says good night to his family and heads to a Cairo police station to spend the night under police watch.
While what he describes as 'half an imprisonment' has disrupted his family life, career and education, Maher considers himself luckier than other activists of the 2011 uprising that ended autocratic president Hosni Mubarak's 30 years in power.
Like many young Egyptians who camped out for days at Cairo's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) in 2011, the 38-year-old Nobel Peace Prize nominee expected Mubarak's downfall to pave the way for more freedoms to allow the country to flourish.
Instead, Maher and other activists say things have gotten worse.
""No one imagined that the situation would be this bad,"" Maher, an engineer who is also studying for a degree in political science, told Reuters. ""Even the right to gather in a crowd or to express an opinion is not available."" 
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power determined to crush the Muslim Brotherhood after a year in office that saw the economy suffer, has also targeted secular activists, including many prominent figures of the January 25 uprising.
Many have fled the country, others are in prison while a third group have been cowed into silence.
Maher, freed from a three-year-prison sentence in early 2017 for breaking anti-protest laws, immediately began a three-year-probation period under which he must spend the night, from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m., at a police station.
Sisi supporters, who now celebrate the anniversary of the June 30, 2013 uprising that toppled Mursi, argue tough action was needed to rescue the economy and get rid of Islamists they accused of trying to take steps to retain power.
Egypt's economy has begun to turn around since Sisi came to office in 2014, but reforms adopted under a 2016 IMF loan that included devaluing the Egyptian pound and a gradual lifting of state fuel subsidies have also deepened poverty in Egypt.
WORST CRACKDOWN IN MODERN HISTORY
Rights activists say that Sisi has presided over the worst crackdown on freedoms in Egypt's modern history.
Thousands of activists, most of them Islamists but also including dozens of liberals and leftists, have been jailed under strict regulations imposed since 2013.
Sisi's admirers say ending years of lawlessness that began in 2011 needs firmness, pointing to repeated Islamist militant attacks on security forces and civilians.
Rights activists say that intellectuals, government critics and human rights campaigners have been rounded up on charges of belonging to ""terrorist organizations"" or publishing false news or disturbing public order.
They include Wael Abbas, an award-winning journalist, Hazem Abdelazim, a well-known Sisi supporter turned critic, and Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent blogger jailed for five years.
Ahmed Douma, another figurehead of the 2011 uprising, was sentenced to 15 years in jail earlier this month after he was convicted of rioting and attacking security forces in 2011.
""The whole world had thought that the youths of the revolution would play a role in running the country, like in any country that looks for qualified youths would,"" said Maher, who founded the April 6 Movement, a grassroots group founded in 2008 that had campaigned against Mubarak's rule. ""Sadly, there is a big hostility toward the youths,"" he added. 
Last September, 17 U.N. human rights experts criticized Egypt for its use of anti-terrorism laws to detain activists fighting for women's rights and against graft, torture and extra-judicial killings.
Israa Abdel Fattah, another member of the April 6 Movement, said that Egypt was worse off now than it was before the January 25 uprising. ""Egypt can change and everything will be good if it possessed one thing, and that's justice,"" said Abdel Fattah, who like many other activists is barred from traveling abroad.
Activists say the only positive result of the revolution, a two-term limit on presidential terms, could also soon be lost if Sisi supporters pursue plans to amend the constitution.
At a ceremony to mark Police Day, Sisi paid tribute to the January 25 uprising, but stayed silent when a speaker asked him to agree to remain in office for two additional four-year terms.
Anwar al-Hawary, former editor of the privately-owned al-Masri al-Youm newspaper, said Sisi appears to favor staying in power beyond a second term, warning that any such move would be ""illogical"".

""The country cannot cope with another uprising or a coup,"" he said.

CHESTERFIELD, England (Reuters) - As Britain grapples with whether to leave the European Union, some voters in an ancient English town have a message for the politicians in London: Do not betray Brexit.
The United Kingdom's labyrinthine crisis over EU membership is approaching its finale with an extraordinary array of options including no-deal Brexit, a last-minute deal, a snap election, or a delay and new referendum.
In Chesterfield, a leave-supporting northern town which could take an economic hit if Britain dropped out of the EU, some voters were clear they would prefer to leave without a deal and would turn away from politics if Brexit was thwarted.
""It's got to be no deal - and we are not all going to die and crumble. We are Great Britain remember!"" said Valerie Quigley, 70, a leave supporter who traditionally votes for the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Theresa May.
Quigley, who has owned a womenswear shop for 26 years, said May was doing a good job in tough circumstances.
""If somebody else thinks that they can do better than Theresa May then let them get on with it,"" Quigley said. 
""I think in Brussels and the EU they are scared to death that we are going.""
While an unscientifically small sample, responses in Chesterfield show the divide between the 17.4 million leave voters and an elite in London that mainly views Brexit as damaging.
May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership who won the top job in the turmoil following the 2016 Brexit referendum, has warned thwarting that vote will threaten social cohesion by undermining belief in British democracy.
SPLIT NATION
In a step that could overturn centuries of constitutional convention, some lawmakers want to grab control of Brexit from the government to prevent what they say would be an economically disastrous no-deal departure.
In 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed leaving the EU while 48.1 percent favored staying.
Polling shows the United Kingdom remains deeply divided, though a slim majority now favors staying.
Research indicates very few leave voters have changed their minds and that while some polls seem to indicate growing support for another referendum, results vary depending on the question's wording. 
In Chesterfield, a market town 150 miles (240 km) north of London which traces its history to Roman times and is famous for a crooked church, leave voters were clear about wanting a clean break with the club the United Kingdom joined in 1973. 
""We voted to either stay in the European Union or leave the European Union. There wasn't a box to tick for a deal. I voted to leave,"" said David Mawson, 51, who runs a mobility business. 
No deal means there would be no transition so the exit would be abrupt - the nightmare scenario for international businesses and the dream of 'hard' Brexiteers who want a decisive split.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said leaving the EU with no transition could be akin to the 1970s oil shock, though some Brexiteers say such forecasts are scare tactics.
Chesterfield's member of parliament, Toby Perkins of the opposition Labour Party, warned last year at a nearby Toyota factory that a no-deal Brexit would have a devastating impact on the car industry.
Nearly 80 people from Chesterfield are employed at the plant, Perkins said. Toyota has said a no-deal Brexit could temporarily halt output at the plant.
DEMOCRACY AT STAKE
Perkins, whose constituency has been controlled by Labour for much of the 20th century, voted to stay in the 2016 referendum, but voted against May's deal on Jan. 15.
Deborah Chattaway, a 52-year-old seamstress, voted Labour in the 2017 election but said she would not vote for them again. She voted to stay in the EU but fears a no-deal Brexit and so thinks Labour and other parties should rally around May.
""I think all the parties, Labour and the rest, they need to get behind Theresa May and get us a good deal for the country and let’s get it pushed through, best for everybody,"" she said.
But fears of ""betrayal"" are acute.
""If they go back on this vote, how can we ever have another vote about anything?"" said Mawson, who voted Conservative at the last election.
Jesse Lilley, 66, a former factory worker, used to vote Labour but feels it no longer represents the working classes. 
He wants to leave without a deal and is worried politicians will halt Brexit. 
""They are going to undo that Pandora’s box and they don’t know what is going to come out,"" Lilley said. 

""Betray them and then say we are going to have another election or another vote? People will just not bother. It will cause problems for the next twenty years.""

The special permission to use multiple-entry Syrian visas for access to Damascus was rescinded at the start of January with no explanation from the Syrian government, EU diplomats told Reuters, complicating efforts to distribute humanitarian aid to civil war victims.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>","From Italy and within, Macron assailed by political foes","By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - Populists and the far-right in Italy and France are mounting a multi-pronged assault on President Emmanuel Macron, hoping to unsettle his centrist, pro-Europe agenda ahead of European Parliament elections in May, while also shoring up their own bases.
Italy's two deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League and Luigi Di Maio of the populist, anti-establishment 5-Star movement, have sought to rile Macron on a host of inflammatory issues.
Salvini and Di Maio appear to believe that in attacking Macron, a strong Europhile, their core voters in Italy will be motivated. Macron has been upfront in framing the European election as a battle between anti-immigrant nationalists and pro-EU 'progressives' like himself. 
In the ballot, he hopes to carry the center and, along with allies, potentially build the largest bloc in the European parliament. The far-right and populists believe they may win a third or more of the vote, shattering traditional power bases. 
With vocal support for France's often violent ""Yellow Vests"" movement and suggestions that Macron's administration is driving neo-colonialism in Africa, the Italian duo have ignored the convention of not interfering in another country's politics.
The rise in tension shows how divisive the May 23-26 election is set to be, and hints at shifts in Europe's political landscape that resemble populism in the United States, with fringe parties looking to overturn centrists like Macron.
Macron and his ministers have mostly claimed the high ground, ignoring many of the Italian politicians' charges, while issuing flat responses to others.
But on Tuesday, angered by Di Maio's accusations that Paris is worsening poverty in Africa and encouraging migration to Europe, the French foreign ministry took the unusual step of calling in Italy's ambassador.
On Wednesday the foreign ministry went further, dismissing Salvini's claims that Macron is unpopular and his hope that Macron's En Marche party will lose in the European ballot.
""These unfounded statements should be read in the context of domestic Italian politics,"" ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said. ""They are unacceptable.""
In the National Assembly, Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said Salvini was playing to a domestic audience and would have no impact in France. ""We're not going to be drawn into a stupidity contest,"" she said.
Asked if Macron had spoken about Salvini and Di Maio at the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux replied: ""No, because we only discuss issues that are important to the country.""
While Salvini has long been an outspoken critic of Macron, the assault by Di Maio is relatively new and is a sign of the problems his 5-star movement is having domestically, where it has been falling in polls ahead of the EU vote.
5-Star is seeking new alliances within the European Union and sees France's ""Yellow Vests"", who have said they will run candidates in the election, as a potential ally. 
    ""Similar to other European governments, the French government is now mostly interested in protecting the interests of the elites and the privileged, but not of the people,"" Di Maio wrote earlier this month. ""Yellow Vests, don't give up!""
NOT ALL ABOUT MIGRANTS
Yet while Macron dismisses Salvini and Di Maio as meddling outsiders, he faces a similar assault at home from Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, who hopes to ally her party with Salvini's in the European Parliament. 
Le Pen, soundly defeated by Macron in the 2017 presidential vote, launched a campaign this month to turn the French against a new Franco-German treaty of unity and commitment to Europe.
In videos - including one on Twitter viewed 165,000 times - Le Pen claimed the treaty would involve France surrendering territory to Germany in the Alsace and Lorraine border regions, that French citizens there would have to learn German, and that Macron was considering sharing France's permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council with Germany.
The Aachen/Aix-la-Chapelle treaty signed on Tuesday included none of those things, but in an era when social media can have more impact than official documents, the Elysee Palace issued a firm rebuttal of Le Pen's claims.
""NON, Alsace and Lorraine will not be transferred to Germany,"" it said, using capitals several times.
Le Pen, whose party has taken a 9 million euro loan from a Russian bank and whose social media activity is frequently amplified by pro-Kremlin accounts, seems to be aiming to shore up her voter base, which worries about France giving up sovereignty and wants a greater emphasis on national identity.
In some opinion polls, Le Pen's party is marginally ahead of Macron's on Europe. If her vote is combined with other far-right parties in France, they are several points clear. 
But campaigning has not properly begun. Macron is spending the next two months conducting a nationwide debate to ""listen"" to French voters and respond to the ""Yellow Vests"", the most serious challenge his presidency has faced. 
For Dominique Moisi, a political consultant at the Montaigne Institute, the rupture between Italy and France is not just about the May election, but a more fundamental shift in ties between neighbors who helped to found the European project.
Moisi argues that France's greater closeness to Germany has left Italy feeling looked down upon, and that has fueled resentment, not just among populists and the far-right, but among Italian elites.
""Seen from Rome ... there's a very emotional feeling towards France, as if it has scorned and even abandoned Italy,"" he wrote this month. 
""From the crisis in Libya, a country Italy knows well, to the migration issue, Italians feel that at each turn they have been deliberately ignored by a country that increasingly, and with less and less justification, looks down on them.""
If true, Salvini and Di Maio may succeed in exploiting those sentiments by bashing France in the run-up to the May vote. For Di Maio, that effort is clear in his attempts to align his movement with the ""Yellow Vests"". 
Le Pen - who like Salvini has met Steve Bannon and taken advice on how he engineered Donald Trump's presidential victory - is taking a similar tack, albeit on different issues.
Where Le Pen and Salvini may fall down, according to Guillaume Liegey, a pollster who worked on Macron's 2017 campaign, is if they focus too heavily on immigration, which for Le Pen and Salvini has been a mainstay issue.
In an article in the Guardian this week, Liegey said polling by his group showed that mass migration was not the main concern of voters, who ultimately want to feel a sense of security and that they are being listened to.
Macron's ""grand debate"" may enable him to show that he is indeed listening to voters' concerns. There are already signs that his popularity ratings, once barely above 20 percent, have started to climb again although only by a few points.

""If the populist danger can be averted in Europe, a key part of the solution lies not in pandering to anti-migrant slogans but in working to burst the bubbles people are all too often locked into,"" Liegey said.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Aid curbs in Myanmar's Rakhine impact 'at least 50,000 people' - U.N.","YANGON (Reuters) - New government curbs on aid activities in Myanmar's western Rakhine State ""are affecting at least 50,000 people"", the United Nations has said in an internal note, highlighting the growing impact of recent fighting on the civilian population.
The Rakhine State government this month blocked non-governmental organizations and U.N. agencies from traveling to rural areas in five townships in northern and central parts of the state affected by conflict.
The International Committee of the Red Cross and U.N. World Food Programme were exempted from the ban on aid activity in the region, where fighting between government troops and autonomy-seeking ethnic Rakhine rebels has displaced thousands.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) summarized recent information gathered from aid organizations on the impact of the restrictions in the two central Rakhine townships of Kyauktaw and Ponnagyun.
UNOCHA circulated a note on the findings late on Wednesday to some U.N. officials and non-governmental organizations seeking comments and updates on the situation. Reuters obtained the note independently and reviewed it on Thursday. 
It said that the restrictions forced aid organizations to reduce or stop pre-existing programs, including the provision of healthcare, clean water, school construction and teacher training, among other activities.
For example, the agency said that in Kyauktaw ""mobile health services were to be provided in 15 villages, totaling around 17,000 people, involving around 1,600 people to be treated on average each month ... the provision of these services has now been put on hold"".
The affected activities included primary health care and malnutrition screening and treatment, it said. 
""In Ponnagyun, around 220 health consultations in rural areas of the township have been stopped, including emergency referral services,"" the agency said in the note. 
Fighting has forced about 5,000 people to flee from their homes and to take shelter in monasteries and communal areas across the region since early January, according to UNOCHA.
Myanmar's president, speaking in a rare meeting with the commander-in-chief this month, urged the military to ""crush"" the rebels of the Arakan Army. The president, Win Myint, is a loyalist of the de facto government leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Last week, the United Nations called on the government to allow ""rapid and unimpeded"" humanitarian access to the area.
""We are currently working to assess the impact that recent access restrictions could have on the delivery of pre-existing and ongoing humanitarian programs in the affected townships,"" said Pierre Peron, UNOCHA's spokesman in Myanmar in response to an email seeking comment on the internal note.
""This is an evolving assessment.""
He said the United Nations was ""liaising closely with the authorities in Rakhine State, who have now invited humanitarian organizations to individually apply for travel authorizations for specific activities"", adding he hoped authorities would respond ""quickly and positively"" to such applications.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not respond to calls seeking comment.
'READY TO RESPOND' 
The Rakhine municipal affairs minister, Win Myint, could not be reached for comment. He told Reuters earlier the restrictions had been put in place for ""security reasons"" and he did not know when they would be lifted.
Reuters contacted several affected NGOs seeking comment on the situation. One of them, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said: ""Along with most other organizations we do not currently have access to respond to the needs of the conflict-affected and displaced populations"".
""We have emergency supplies prepositioned and remain ready to respond if this situation changes,"" said Laura Marshall, the NRC's acting country director.
The affected aid groups published a statement on Tuesday expressing ""deep concern"" about the restrictions. 
Rakhine State has been roiled by successive rounds of violence in recent years. 
In 2017, an extensive military crackdown, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents, prompted about 730,000 Rohingya to flee westwards into neighboring Bangladesh.
The Arakan Army, the group behind the recent fighting, is demanding greater autonomy from the central government for the state, where the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine people form the majority of the population.
Arakan Army fighters killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts in early January, state media reported. 

An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in the north of Rakhine that also targeted civilians.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. and Taliban officials in Qatar entered a fourth day on Thursday, with the two sides trying to establish a mechanism for a ceasefire in the 17-year Afghan war and open dialogue between the insurgents and the Afghan government.
U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad's meeting with Taliban representatives was originally slated to run over two days, and its unexpected extension was a positive sign, according to two senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan who have been kept informed of the progress made in Qatar.
During the first two days, the talks focused on a roadmap for the withdrawal of the foreign forces and a guarantee that Afghanistan would not be used for hostile acts against the United States and its allies, according to one of Taliban leaders.
""The mechanism for a ceasefire and ways to enter into an intra-Afghan dialogue were the two other big topics that were supposed to be discussed on Thursday,"" he told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A third source based in the Gulf, who has close ties to the Taliban representatives, said the decision to extend the meeting in the Qatari capital Doha came after ""positive progress"" during the first two days.
Officials at the U.S. embassy in Kabul were not immediately available to comment on the diplomatic developments. 
Members of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council (AHPC), a body which oversees peace efforts but does not represent the government said they were hoping that positive news would emerge from Doha.
""When talks take a long time it means the discussion is in a sensitive and important stage, and the participants are getting close to a positive result,"" said Sayed Ehsan Taheri, the spokesman for AHPC in Kabul.
""I hope this meeting opens a way for an intra-Afghan dialogue, he said.
The Taliban who are fighting to oust foreign troops have repeatedly rejected the offer to hold direct talks with President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which they consider an illegitimate foreign-imposed regime. 
The U.S. and regional powers insist that the peace process should be ""Afghan-led and Afghan-owned"".
Diplomatic efforts to end the United State's longest running conflict intensified last year after the appointment of the Afghan-born Khalilzad to lead direct talks with the Taliban.
Khalilzad has held at least four meetings with the Taliban representatives. But there has been no let up in the violence, even as the two sides hold talks over meals in a hotel suite in Doha. 

And abiding fears about how Afghan government forces would withstand the Taliban threat without U.S. military support have been heightened by reports that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to bring home almost half of the 14,000 U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan.

Parliament is in deadlock over Britain's departure from the European Union after resoundingly rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May's plan last week, throwing up several outcomes, including leaving without a deal or a second referendum.
May has ruled out staging a second vote, saying parliament should respect the 2016 referendum when 52 percent of Britain voted to leave the EU. Corbyn also does not support a second referendum but says the option should remain on the table.
Supporters of a second referendum say it is the only way to break the deadlock in parliament by asking for the people to decide.
""The clock is ticking and at this late stage, I appeal to Jeremy Corbyn to do the right thing by the majority of our voters, our supporters and members and back a people's vote,"" Labour lawmaker Luciana Berger said.
Conservative lawmaker Sarah Wollaston said they could only force through a plan for a second vote if Corbyn supported such a move in the 650-seat lower house of parliament. 

""Without the unequivocal backing of the Labour leadership at the moment we would not have the numbers,"" she said.

The teenager, who as a minor was not named in the indictment, was one of five students from the occupied West Bank arrested following the October attack on 47-year-old Aisha al-Rawbi, who suffered a fatal head wound.
According to the indictment, the attack was motivated by hostility toward Arabs.
The teenager, who his lawyer said denied the charge of manslaughter with a terrorism context, was detained in custody pending a further court hearing.
The students, all under the age of 18, attended a seminary in Rehelim, a Jewish settlement near the Palestinian city of Nablus, Israel's domestic intelligence service had said after their initial arrest.

The West Bank sees frequent friction between Palestinians, who seek the territory for a future state, and Israel’s settlers, some of whom identify with radical Jewish groups.

Hanoi is preparing to receive Kim Jong Un for a state visit, two sources told Reuters on Jan. 17, while officials and diplomats said Vietnam was keen to host a second summit between Kim and Trump.
""It is up to the United States and North Korea to decide on the location and the timing of the summit,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told a regular news conference on Thursday. 
Trump and Kim held a historic first summit in Singapore in June. The White House said last week a second summit would be held in late February but did not say where.
Vietnam has repeatedly said that it is willing to play an active part in dialogue between the United States and North Korea.
Hang said Vietnam had no information about a summit or a possible state visit by either Trump or Kim, but it would be able to accommodate them if asked.
""We are very confident in our ability to host international events in Vietnam, as we successfully held the APEC summit in 2017 and, other international events,"" said Hang.
Vietnam hosted the 2017 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the central city of Danang and, in September last year, the capital, Hanoi, played host to the World Economic Forum. 
Both events were attended by several high-profile world leaders, and both cities have been widely touted as possible locations for a second summit between Trump and Kim. 
There has also been speculation about other possible venues, including Bangkok, Hawaii, or a return to Singapore.
North Korean state media reported on Thursday that Kim had expressed satisfaction about the results of talks last week between Trump and North Korea's top nuclear negotiator, and Kim spoke highly of Trump.

Kim ordered working-level preparations for a second North Korea-U.S. summit, media said.

The trial of Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 26, was suspended in December as her lawyers argued with prosecutors over access to statements made by seven witnesses. It was not clear when the trial would resume.
Siti Aisyah is charged along with Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 30, of poisoning Kim Jong Nam with liquid VX, a banned chemical weapon, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017.
Defense lawyers say the women thought they were playing a prank for a reality TV show and were tricked by North Korean agents who are still at large. 
Siti Aisyah was set to take the stand this month after the court ruled last August that prosecutors had established a case against the two women.
But the trial was suspended after Siti Aisyah's lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, appealed a court ruling denying him access to statements given by seven witnesses to police. 
Gooi said the documents were vital to his client's case as five of the witnesses had gone missing.
Malaysia's Court of Appeal on Thursday overturned the court ruling and ordered the statements to be given to the defense team within two weeks, Gooi told reporters.
Prosecutors have appealed the decision, he said, which will likely further delay the trial. 
""The prosecution has requested for a stay of the order as well as a stay in the proceedings of the trial,"" Gooi said.
Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family's dynastic rule of North Korea. 

Some South Korean lawmakers say the regime of his half-brother, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had ordered his execution. Pyongyang has denied the accusation.

Duduzane Zuma faced charges of corruption and conspiracy to commit corruption related to his dealings with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers accused of using their relationship with former president Zuma to win state contracts.
The Guptas and Zumas deny wrongdoing.
Zuma appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Johannesburg which confirmed that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had withdrawn the case pending further evidence.
The NPA's failure to build a case against Duduzane Zuma is a setback for its promised fight against graft.
Jacob Zuma's successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, has staked his reputation on rooting out corruption since becoming president in February.
The Guptas have denied there was anything untoward in their relationship with former president Zuma, but their ties are being investigated in an inquiry that could take months, or even years, to be concluded.
The Guptas' whereabouts are not publicly known.

Duduzane was also due to appear at Randburg Magistrate's Court in Johannesburg in March to face charges of culpable homicide over a fatal car crash in 2014, when his Porsche 911 collided with a minivan taxi, killing one woman and seriously injuring another who later died in hospital.

After U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said he and Trump had discussed Turkey setting up a 20-mile-deep safe zone in Syria along the border.
Cavusoglu told broadcaster A Haber that nothing was yet certain about the planned safe zone, but that Ankara and Washington's views were in line, aside from a couple of points.
""We could establish a safe zone on our own but we will not exclude the U.S., Russia or others if they would like to cooperate,"" Cavusoglu said.
Speaking after Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow on Wednesday, Cavusoglu said Ankara and Moscow were ""on the same page"" regarding a Syrian political solution aside from the issue of whether President Bashar al-Assad should stay in office. Moscow backs Assad while Ankara wants him gone.
Cavusoglu said Turkey was in indirect contact with the Syrian government, but did not elaborate.
Cavusoglu also said Turkey and the United States had started discussing who will be in the administration of Manbij, a Syrian town currently controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
Turkey regards the Kurdish YPG militia as a terrorist group and Erdogan said on Monday Turkey would not allow the secure zone that Ankara is considering setting up to become a base for militants.

Cavusoglu said the U.S. special representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, will visit Ankara on Thursday and hold talks with Turkish officials.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 03:55AM ET</span>",Maduro rival Guaido claims Venezuela presidency with U.S. backing,"By Angus Berwick, Mayela Armas and Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, winning backing from Washington and parts of Latin America and prompting socialist Nicolas Maduro, the country's leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump formally recognized Guaido shortly after his announcement and praised his plan to hold elections. That was followed by similar statements from Canada and a slew of right-leaning Latin American governments, including Venezuela's neighbors Brazil and Colombia.
Lawmakers in Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, provided support to its military, and become a lender of last resort as the economy implodes, denounced the declarations.
Lower parliamentary house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called the steps to remove Maduro illegal, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. A second lawmaker, Franz Klinzevich, said Moscow could wind up its military cooperation with Venezuela if Maduro was ousted.
In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said recognizing a leader other than Maduro might cause ""chaos"".
In Paris, a presidency official said France was consulting with its European partners about the situation.
At a rally on Wednesday in the east of the capital Caracas that drew hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Guaido accused Maduro of usurping power. He promised to create a transitional government that would help the oil-rich nation escape its hyperinflationary economic collapse.
""I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation,"" 35-year old Guaido, the head of the opposition-run congress, told an exuberant crowd.
Guaido's declaration takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognized abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions.
In a televised broadcast from the presidential palace, Maduro accused the opposition of seeking to stage a coup with Washington's support.
""We've had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it! Here is a people willing to defend this land,"" said Maduro, flanked by Socialist Party leaders. 
Any change of government will rest on a shift in allegiance within the armed forces. So far, they have stood by Maduro through two waves of street protests and a steady dismantling of democratic institutions. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Venezuelan military to protect ""the welfare and well-being of all Venezuelan citizens,"" and said Washington would take ""appropriate actions"" against anyone who endangered the safety of U.S. personnel.
The United States would conduct its diplomatic relations with Venezuela through ""the government of interim President Guaido,"" he said.
Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Wednesday that the armed forces did not recognize a self-proclaimed president ""imposed by shadowy interests ... outside the law."" Military top brass indicated their continued support for Maduro in tweets.
BROKEN STATUE
In a potent symbol of Venezuelan anger, demonstrators in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz on Tuesday toppled a statue of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. They broke the statue in half and dangled part of it from a bridge.
Maduro took power in 2013 after his mentor Chavez died. As the oil price sank and revenues dried up, the social welfare programs designed by Chavez faltered. Venezuela spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis, with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year.
But Maduro nevertheless started a second term on Jan. 10, following a widely-boycotted election last year that many foreign governments described as a sham.
In the Chacao district of eastern Caracas, a traditional opposition bastion, a dozen protesters spoke of a renewed confidence in dislodging Maduro and predicted a new wave of demonstrations. 
""The struggle will be long,"" said Ciro Cirino on Altamira plaza, minutes after police on motorbikes charged a crowd of several thousand protesters, firing tear gas to disperse them.
""The police push us back... and we keep going back. We are going to be here until there is a change,"" said Cirino, a 35-year-old computer programmer.
""We're hungry. Look how skinny I am: there's no food in my house,"" said another protester holding a petrol bomb, who declined to give his name ""We have to get rid of Maduro.""
Some 3 million Venezuelans have fled abroad over the past five years to escape widespread shortages of food and medicine.
Eight people have so far died across Venezuela in clashes with police this week, according to local officials and rights groups. 
Venezuela's constitution says if the presidency is determined to be vacant, new elections should be called in 30 days and that the head of the congress should assume the presidency in the meantime.
However, the pro-government Supreme Court has ruled that all actions taken by the National Assembly congress are null and void and the government has jailed dozens of opposition leaders and activists for seeking to overthrow Maduro through violent street demonstrations in 2014 and 2017.
As pressure mounts on Maduro both internally and externally, the Trump administration is considering sanctions on Venezuelan oil as soon as this week, according to sources. 
The South American OPEC country has the largest crude reserves in the world and is a major supplier to U.S. refiners, though output is hovering near 70-year lows and reaction in the oil markets was muted on Wednesday.

Local bonds rebounded, with Venezuela's benchmark 2027 bond  trading above 31 cents on the dollar for the first time since May 2018.

Sultan Abdullah, 59, ruler of the central state of Pahang, will formally take over the throne on Jan. 31 for a five-year term, the keeper of the rulers' seal said in a statement.
Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy with the king assuming a largely ceremonial role, including acting as custodian of Islam in the Muslim-majority country. The king's assent is needed for the appointment of a prime minister and various senior officials.
Malaysia's nine royal households take turns to provide a king, who is chosen through a vote in a Council of Rulers, made up of the nine households, most of which are led by a sultan.
The king is elected for a five-year term.
The head of the Pahang royal family was next in line in take over from the former king, Sultan Muhammad V, who is the head of the state of Kelantan.
Sultan Muhammad abdicated this month after just two years on the throne, the first time a monarch had stepped down before completing their tenure. 
No reason was given for his decision, which came after images purporting to show him getting married in Russia appeared on social media in December. Posts identified his new wife as Oksana Voevodina, who won a Miss Moscow contest in 2015.
The new king, Sultan Abdullah, succeeded his ailing father as ruler of Pahang last week.
His ascent to the Pahang throne, was seen as a sign that he would take over as the new monarch. 
Sultan Abdullah is on the non-executive supervisory council of football governing body FIFA. He is also the president of the Asian Hockey Federation.

LAGOS (Reuters) - The leading female candidate in Nigeria's presidential election said on Thursday she had withdrawn from the race weeks ahead of the poll to help build a coalition to provide a viable alternative to the country's two main parties. 
Former government minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in 2014, said on Twitter that she had been in talks for three months with other candidates about a coalition.
Nigeria's presidential election is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16. The main candidates in the race to head Africa's top oil producing country are the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president who is representing the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). 
""I have decided to step down from the presidential race and focus on helping to build a coalition for a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the 2019 general,"" said Ezekwesili in a tweet.
Ezekwesili was not considered to be among the frontrunners in the race. Analysts see President Buhari and Abubakar as the only genuine contenders due to the financial power and patronage networks provided by their parties. 
The PDP ruled from 1999, when civilian rule began, until Buhari's 2015 election win with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. The main contenders ahead of February's poll have been in the public eye for decades - Buhari was a military ruler in the 1980s and Abubakar was vice president from 1999-2007. 
Ezekwesili, a former government minister, is a founder of the civil society organization Transparency International. She was considered for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her anti-corruption work.
She is known more recently for her work as co-founder of 'Bring Back Our Girls', a campaign which seeks to raise awareness about some 270 girls who were kidnapped from their school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 by Boko Haram.

Many of the girls managed to escape in the hours following their abduction or have been released in the last few years, but about 100 are still missing and their condition is unknown.

The countries have been at loggerheads since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The call was the latest indication of attempts to improve relations, which began with the reopening of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Baghdad in 2016.
""His Highness ... expressed ...full support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Iraq and its support for its permanent security and prosperity,"" a statement from Abdul Mahdi's office said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that the ""backstop"" provision in the agreement for Britain's withdrawal from the bloc could not be time-limited, since that would defeat its purpose of guaranteeing no hard Irish border.
His comments, made on Germany's DLF public radio, undermine the hopes of some in London that Prime Minister Theresa May could win pro-Brexit legislators for her deal by securing a time limit to the no-border commitment.
Barnier said the withdrawal agreement, roundly rejected by Britain's parliament two weeks ago, was the best one available given the ""famous red lines"", including an end to freedom of movement and to single market membership, that May had set out to define the future relationship.
Barnier, who is due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks in Berlin on Thursday, said that the commitment, seen by Dublin as an essential guarantor of peace on the island, had to be credible.
Another option being floated by some in London, for the border issue to be regulated in a separate bilateral deal with Dublin, was also impossible, since the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would in future be an EU frontier, he said.
""We have to maintain the credibility of this reassurance,"" he said. ""It cannot be time-limited... It's not just about Ireland.""
The Irish Independent newspaper said on Thursday that hundreds of Irish police officers could be deployed to guard the border if Britain left without a deal. It cited a meeting of Police Commissioner Drew Harris with senior staff on Wednesday.
He added that if Britain's red lines changed, there would be scope for changes to the political declaration on the intended future relationship between Britain and the EU that accompanies the withdrawal agreement.
""If something changes with the red lines, then we are ready to talk about that,"" he said. ""We can't make any compromises on the fundamental principles. We can't dilute the single market or split the EU.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A former Chinese diplomat who has Australian citizenship is being held in residential detention in China, government ministers said, and Canberra was disappointed in how long it took Beijing to notify them after the man went missing.
Australia said on Thursday author Yang Hengjun was detained shortly after he flew in to the southern city of Guangzhou from New York last week, but it did not believe his detention was the result of rising tensions between China and the West.
Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said Australia, under existing diplomatic conventions, would normally expect to be told of such a case within three days. Yang went missing on Friday and Canberra was not told until four days later, he said.
""Obviously that is disappointing and we'll be raising that ... with Chinese government officials,"" Pyne told reporters in Beijing, where he arrived on Thursday for previously scheduled talks.
""He's being held in residential surveillance, which we would normally describe as home detention ... my understanding is it's in Beijing,"" he said.
China has so far not commented publicly about Yang's case.
Tensions have risen in recent weeks after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Those arrests were widely seen in the West as retaliation by Beijing for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei Technologies executive, in Canada on Dec. 1. She is accused of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said staff from Australia's embassy met Chinese officials on Thursday to seek answers and, while details were limited, she said there was no evidence that it was linked to Australian criticism of Beijing's detention of the two Canadians.
""At this stage there is no evidence of such a connection ... but I'd be concerned if there was an indication of that,"" she told reporters in Sydney.
""We are calling on the Chinese authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with transparently and fairly,"" Payne said.
'NOT SAFE'
Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, said he asked Yang to avoid traveling to China because of the tensions.
""I tried to persuade him not to go. I didn't think it would be safe for him because of the situation with Huawei but he believed that he would fine as he had been there so many times,"" Feng said.
The Australian government was first alerted that Yang had gone missing after friends said he had not been reachable for several days.
Australia joined international condemnation of the arrest of the two Canadians but Yang has long been in the sights of Chinese authorities. He has criticized what he described as Chinese interference in Australia.
Yang was also reported missing while in China in 2011, emerging several days later. Two sources familiar with the details said he had been detained but agreed to say he was unwell.
However, Yang is not seen as a radical dissident.
Deng Yuwen, a Beijing-based political analyst who knows Yang, told Reuters in a message that he did not know the reason for Yang’s detention but that his WeChat accounts had been deleted. 
""He has basically not publicly released any political essays in recent years,"" Deng said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent since coming to power in 2012, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained. Dozens have been jailed.
Pyne arrived in Beijing on Thursday for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, and other senior officials. His visit was arranged in a bid to repair ties damaged by Australian allegations in 2017 that China was meddling in its domestic affairs.
Analysts said Yang's arrest would add to pressure on Canberra to rebuke its largest trading partner.
""Australia can't hide from this, it will need to respectfully protect its citizens,"" said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.

""This detention marks the new normal in the bilateral tension, which will be constant low-level tension,"" he said.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 01:29AM ET</span>","China could gain, U.S. lose from Japan-South Korea feuds: Japan PM adviser","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Beijing could gain and Washington lose if feuding persists between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, a foreign policy adviser to Japan's premier said on Thursday after the latest row involving a Japanese patrol plane and South Korean warship.
Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have chilled due to intensifying rows over their wartime history, including Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula, threatening regional efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear program.
Adding to the tensions are tit-for-tat allegations of risky moves by each country's military.
In the latest episode, South Korea's military said on Wednesday that a Japanese military plane had made a low altitude flight over a South Korean navy vessel in waters off the Korean peninsula.
Japan said Seoul's allegation was inaccurate.
""The country whose national interests in the region will be most damaged if our two countries' ... bilateral ties are damaged is the United States of America,"" Katsuyuki Kawai, a special foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, told Reuters.
China stands to gain influence over the Korean peninsula if Seoul leaves the ""liberal democratic camp"" exemplified by U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperation, Kawai said, a scenario he said was now being dubbed ""Korexit"".
""Korexit is a nightmare,"" Kawai said.
Wednesday's episode follows a December row over a Japanese complaint that a South Korean destroyer locked its targeting radar on a Japanese surveillance plane. Seoul rejected the accusation.
Relations have also deteriorated since South Korea's top court ruled last year in favor of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japanese firms for wartime forced labor.
The Japanese government says all wartime reparations were dealt with in a 1965 treaty that had normalized ties between the two neighbors.
Kawai said he saw no easy solution to the tensions with Seoul, which he predicted were likely to worsen ahead of the 100th anniversary of the March First Independence Movement against Japanese colonial rule.
""It's a deadlock,"" he said.
U.S President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama sought to improve ties between Seoul and Tokyo in 2014 by engineering a trilateral summit between Abe and then-South Korean president Park Geun-hye.

But Kawai said changed circumstances, including Trump's focus on a planned second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the conservative Park's replacement by left-leaning Moon Jae-in, made a similar intervention difficult.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>","South Sudan embraces old enemy Sudan, now rocked by protests","By Katharine Houreld and Denis Dumo
UNITY OILFIELD, South Sudan (Reuters) - Embattled Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is receiving words of support from some unlikely places as he faces deadly protests calling for him to step down. 
South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 following decades of brutal fighting marked by the mass abduction and enslavement of children, scorched earth ethnic cleansing and famines. 
Yet now the former arch-enemies describe themselves as the best of friends, bound together by a desperate need for oil revenues and peace to allow them to flow.
""When your interest is so intertwined, you are like a conjoined twin,"" South Sudan's oil minister, Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth, told Reuters in the capital of Juba. ""For us, the solution is not to remove Bashir, the solution is to improve the economy."" 
On Monday, Gatkuoth and his Sudanese counterpart jumped over a slaughtered cow, part of a traditional ceremony of welcome marking the start of increased production at Unity Oilfield near the two nations' joint border, where less than a decade ago they fought tank battles against each other.
Some buildings were still pockmarked with bulletholes, and a large dark stain marked a place where a pipeline had been hit. 
The north-south rapprochement comes as violent protests ripple across Sudan, demanding an end to soaring prices and Bashir's 30-year rule. But although South Sudan spent decades fighting Bashir, the idea that he might fall worries many of his former foes.
South Sudan has just emerged from its own five-year civil war. Some from the south fear chaos in the north could derail their own peace deal, which Sudan helped broker and guarantee. 
In return for peace, Sudan gets money. Landlocked South Sudan has most of the oil, but Sudan has the pipeline and port it needs to export it. 
Sudan receives roughly $9-$11 for each barrel of South Sudan's oil that flows through its pipeline.
The arrangement marks an abrupt departure from years of animosity. 
""Both (sides) have previously armed rebels against each other,"" said Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a think tank. ""Times have changed."" 
PEACE TALKS
South Sudan's civil war broke out two years after independence and has been punctuated by atrocities, famine and failed peace deals. But the latest agreement, signed in September, is largely holding.
That's partly because Khartoum persuaded South Sudanese rebels it had previously backed to sign. 
East Africa needed the civil war to end. More than a million South Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda, and more than 850,000 live in Sudan.
Bashir moved the peace talks from Ethiopia to Khartoum, then midwifed an agreement that called for demobilizing, retraining and integrating fighters from all sides. 
""Talks went on day and night for three months and the Sudanese were always with us trying to break the deadlock,"" said Puot Kang Chol, who heads the youth league of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition, which has just been fighting South Sudan's government. 
OIL DIPLOMACY
Now, for the first time, South Sudan's leaders trust the north: They know Bashir needs their oil. Sudan even helped fix the south's broken wells, said oil minister Gatkuoth. 
""Before, Sudan sought to take advantage of our vulnerabilities,"" said Majak D'Agoot, who was deputy head of Sudan's intelligence service before independence and then served as South Sudan's deputy defense minister. ""But we are now on an equal footing."" 
Sudan has long battled rebels on its peripheries - in Darfur and elsewhere. But protests igniting the heart of the nation are an existential threat, D'Agoot said. 
""If you shore up Bashir, the protests will not stop,"" he said. ""Push him out, and the Islamists will move in.""
That worries southerners, given Sudan's borders with Egypt and Libya and its proximity to Yemen, all countries where Islamic State has been active, D'Agoot said. South Sudan is largely Christian; Sudan is mostly Muslim. Bashir's attempt to impose Islamic sharia law was one reason the south seceded.
The protests have gathered pace over the past month, but their organizers are not holding out much hope for support from their southern neighbors. 
""While Bashir may be their enemy in the past, a lot of changes took place for him to be closer now,"" said Amjed Farid Eltayeb, activist and spokesman for the Sudan Change Now movement, which is involved in the current protests and seeks democratic transformation in Sudan. ""I don't think they will really support his removal from power.""
Mindful that a new government in Khartoum might be less friendly, the South Sudanese authorities are careful not to offer any sign of encouragement to the protesters. 
The government-run Media Council warned local journalists in a letter this month that the protests are ""internal issues affecting a friendly nation"" and said ""the media in South Sudan should not write or broadcast instigative statements and comments about it."" 
South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, sent a high-level delegation to Sudan to express solidarity. 
""Relations between Sudan and South Sudan are at their most cordial since independence,"" presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said. ""We look forward to continuing to partner with Bashir.""
But if Bashir goes, officials were keen to say, the South Sudanese government will work with whoever the Sudanese people choose to lead them. 
The first thing Juba will watch for is whether the powerful intelligence chief, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, also known as Salah Gosh, remains. 

Gosh was even more central to South Sudan's peace deal than Bashir himself, Boswell said.

There has been tension between Iran and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision last May to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
""Marzieh Hashemi has been released from her detention without charge and is with her family in Washington D.C.,"" state television said, quoting a statement issued by the family soon after she was freed on Wednesday. 
""They still have serious grievances and they want assurances that this won’t happen to any Muslim – or any other person – ever again."" 
Hashemi will stay in Washington DC for a protest on Friday and she urged protesters in cities across the world to stick to their plans for the protest, Press TV said in a statement. 
Hashemi, 59, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at St. Louis Lambert International Airport and transferred to a detention center in Washington D.C., where she was held for two days before managing to contact her family, Press TV said.
U.S. federal law allows the government to arrest and detain a witness if it can prove their testimony is material to a criminal proceeding and it cannot guarantee their presence through a subpoena.
Hashemi was born Melanie Franklin in the United States and changed her name after converting to Islam. She received Iranian citizenship after marrying an Iranian. She had traveled to the United States to visit her family, Press TV said. 
Several Iranian dual nationals from Austria, Britain, Canada, France and the United States have been detained in the past few years in Iran on charges such as espionage and collaborating with hostile governments.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 11:33PM ET</span>",Indonesia frees Christian politician jailed for blasphemy,"DEPOK, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday released the popular former governor of Jakarta from jail, after serving a reduced two-year sentence for blasphemy against Islam, a case that exposed deep religious divides in the world's largest Muslim-majority country.
An ethnic Chinese Christian, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, 52, lost a 2017 bid to be re-elected governor over charges of insulting the Koran that brought hundreds of thousands of Muslim protesters to the streets, led by hardline Islamist groups.
""My dad's a free man! Thank you everyone for the support,"" his son, Nicholas Sean, said on social media app Instagram, alongside a selfie with his father.
Months of protests and a polarizing election preceded Purnama's jailing in May 2017, raising concerns over the erosion of Indonesia's long-held reputation for pluralism and tolerance, and the creeping influence of Islam in politics.
""(Purnama's) prosecution showed non-Muslims and many Muslims that the freedoms of expression and religion in Indonesia are tenuous,"" New York-based Human Rights Watch said.
Purnama's troubles started with comments that political rivals were deceiving people by using a verse in the Koran to say Muslims should not be led by a non-Muslim.
Later, an incorrectly subtitled video of the comments went viral, eventually leading to his defeat at the polls and his imprisonment on charges of blasphemy. 
As a figure with a no-nonsense reputation for cutting through red tape while in office, he remains popular with progressive Indonesians. 
""We support him, not because of his religion or beliefs, but because of his good work,"" said one of this Muslim supporters, Siti Afifah, who had waited outside the prison for his release. 
But Ahok, as he is popularly known in Indonesia, is unlikely to re-enter politics any time soon, media say.
His representatives say he is considering launching a talk show and running his family's oil trading business.
Last week, in a letter from behind bars, Purnama said he now wanted to be known by his initials ""BTP"", and apologized to those hurt by his remarks when in office.
He also urged supporters to exercise their right to vote in April's presidential election, which many fear may also be tainted by the religious and racial tension that marred the Jakarta governor race two years ago.
President Joko Widodo - once a steadfast ally of Purnama's - is running for re-election against retired general Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo endorsed the massive protests against Purnama two years ago and backed the winning ticket in that election.

A court-appointed medical panel concluded last week that Fujimori, 80, was healthy enough to be forced from the local hospital where he was rushed for treatment in October, right after a judge annulled a pardon granted to him in 2017.
Fujimori, a rightwing populist who led Peru from 1990-2000, has said for years that he suffers from life-threatening health problems, including heart issues, that should exempt him from prison. 
His critics say he is exaggerating and should not receive special treatment.
Before being driven by police back to a jail on the outskirts of Lima, Fujimori posted a picture of himself looking weary and disheveled. ""The end of my life is near,"" Fujimori said on Twitter next to the picture.
But the medical panel found him to be in stable condition and he was discharged by the hospital on Wednesday. The white truck he was transported in was followed by local media, which showed him sitting next to his son Kenji.
The head of Peru's penitentiary institute said Fujimori will have access to a doctor during the day and round-the-clock nurses.
Fujimori's supporters had cheered when he was pardoned a little over a year ago by former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who said he did not want Fujimori to die in prison.
But the so-called humanitarian pardon was widely seen as political payback as it came days after Fujimori's supporters in Congress saved Kuczynski from near impeachment.
Since then, Kuczynski has resigned over graft allegations he denied and the pardon was overturned by a Supreme Court judge.
Fujimori's daughter, opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, was jailed in October pending trial over money launder allegations she denies. In recent months, several lawmakers have resigned from her party, which won a majority of seats in Congress in the 2016 election.
The Fujimoris, whose forebears migrated from Japan, have said they are the victims of political persecution, but have not provided any evidence to back up the claim.
Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2009 for commanding death squads that massacred civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his government. He was later found guilty of corruption.
His supporters credit him with ending a severe economic crisis and quashing leftist rebels who started a violent conflict that claimed 69,000 lives.

The 21-year-old suspect, identified as Zephen Xaver, called 911 dispatchers and said he had shot five people inside the bank, according to authorities.
When police entered the bank, the gunman had barricaded himself inside but eventually surrendered, the Sebring Police Department said in a statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Police did not offer any details about a possible motive.
""Today has been a tragic day in our community,"" Hoglund said. ""We've suffered significant loss at the hands of a senseless criminal doing a senseless crime.""
No information has been released about the victims, who were the only people in the bank at the time of the shooting, police said.
A spokeswoman for the bank, Sue Mallino, said, ""We are working closely with officials and seeking to take care of everyone affected at our Sebring, Florida branch.""
A spokeswoman for Stevens-Henager College in Utah said Xaver was an online student from September to December before he voluntarily withdrew. 
Xaver lived for a time in northwest Indiana, local news in Indiana reported, citing social media accounts associated with the same name. 
Xaver was hired in November to work at Avon Park Correctional Institution, a Florida Department of Corrections prison, before he resigned earlier this month, FloridaToday.com reported, citing state officials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors have stepped up efforts to pressure witnesses to testify against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, WikiLeaks said on Wednesday, in connection with what it said were secret criminal charges filed by the Trump administration.
WikiLeaks did not mention any names in its public statement. But Assange's lawyers identified some of those contacted in a document asking the human rights arm of the Organization of American States to demand that the charges be unsealed.
Reuters obtained excerpts of the document filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and spoke to one of the persons named.
President Barack Obama's administration extensively investigated Assange and WikiLeaks after it published hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables and secret documents detailing U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The administration ultimately decided not to prosecute, however, on the grounds the group's work was too similar to journalistic activities protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Late last year, a court filing by prosecutors in an unrelated case referred to a sealed American indictment of Assange. Prosecutors said the filing was made in error and declined to confirm whether any charges had been filed.
Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks during his 2016 presidential campaign for publishing material about Hillary Clinton. Not long after Trump took office, however, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, now Secretary of State, publicly called it a ""non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."" 
Assange, an Australian national, has taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation that was eventually dropped.
A spokesman for the federal prosecutors' office in Alexandria, Virginia, which has taken the lead for several years in investigations into WikiLeaks, did not respond to a request for comment on this story. 
According to the document filed to the human rights commission, one of the people contacted by Alexandria prosecutors was Jacob Appelbaum, a Berlin-based U.S. computer expert and hacker.
Appelbaum told Reuters that while prosecutors offered him broad immunity from prosecution, he had no interest in cooperating or testifying before a grand jury.
Another potential witness targeted by U.S. prosecutors was David House, a Massachusetts computer programmer, the document said. House was involved in setting up a group to support Chelsea Manning, a U.S. soldier who passed on military communications to WikiLeaks and was jailed by U.S. authorities. 
House could not be reached. The American Civil Liberties Union which represented him in connection with the Manning case did not respond to requests for comment.

The Justice Department also contacted American activist and computer scientist, Jason Katz. Katz, who has lived in Iceland since 2011, did not respond to a request for comment sent to that country's Pirate Party, of which he was a founding member.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 09:35PM ET</span>",Mexico says will not accept return of at-risk U.S. asylum seekers,"By Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two U.S.-Mexico meetings have been held to work out details of a new plan to return across the shared border migrants seeking U.S. asylum, but Mexico will not accept anybody facing a credible threat back home, a Mexico Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
In a major policy change, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said on Dec. 20 it would send non-Mexican migrants who cross the U.S. southern border back to wait in Mexico while their U.S. asylum requests are processed.
At the time, Mexico said it would accept some Central American asylum seekers for humanitarian reasons, in what many saw as an early concession to Trump by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1.
Trump is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the Mexican border, triggering a 33-day U.S. government shutdown which has left 800,000 federal workers without pay.
In an interview on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco said Mexico cannot accept the return of migrants who are ""in danger.""
""If they return people that are vulnerable, that have a founded fear of persecution in Mexico, or people that require some special attention, we don't have resources to address that,"" he said.
Velasco did not say how Mexico and the United States would determine which asylum seekers were at risk in Mexico. Last year about 93,000 people sought asylum at the southern border, up 67 percent from 2017, according to U.S. government data. 
Serious doubts exist over whether Mexico can keep Central American asylum seekers who are fleeing poverty and crime safe, especially in border towns that are often more violent than the cities they left. Authorities are investigating the recent deaths of two Honduran teenagers kidnapped and killed in the border city of Tijuana.
It is unclear how Mexico plans to house what could be thousands of asylum seekers for the months, or years, it takes U.S. immigration cases to be heard. A backlog of more than 800,000 cases is pending in immigration courts.
Velasco said Mexico's interior and foreign ministries had held two meetings since the announcement in which the two sides discussed details such as at what time and in what ports of entry asylum seekers would be returned to Mexico.
""We are going to accept certain people, with a notification to appear before a court in the United States. Now we are explaining who those certain people are. We are trying to understand how they would return them. Under what conditions."" 
In a move that may make it easier for Mexico to accept Central Americans returned by the United States, Mexico has started handing out ""humanitarian"" visas to Central American migrants. Holders of the one-year visas can apply for a work permit.
Mexico's Immigration Office said it has received more than 10,000 requests for humanitarian visas, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
""We are registering their entry into Mexico and giving them a legal status in Mexico,"" said Velasco.

No date has been set for the United States to start returning migrants to Mexico, Velasco said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday, signaling potential new sanctions against the country's vital oil sector as it recognized Venezuela's opposition leader as interim president.
With street protests against Maduro under way across Venezuela, President Donald Trump said the United States recognized Juan Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly congress, as the country's leader and called socialist Maduro's government ""illegitimate.""
In response, Maduro said he was breaking diplomatic relations with the United States and giving U.S. embassy personnel 72 hours to leave Venezuela. 
The United States, however, rejected Maduro's move to cut ties, saying it did not think he had the authority to sever ties and it would conduct relations with a government led by Guaido.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned Maduro and his loyalists that Washington was ready to ramp up oil, gold and other sanctions and take unspecified actions ""if they choose to harm any of the National Assembly members or any of the other duly legitimate officials of the government of Venezuela.""
Asked whether he was considering U.S. military intervention, Trump told reporters: ""We're not considering anything, but all options are on the table.""
Venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging Guaido to assume the presidency since Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on Jan. 10, following a widely boycotted election last year that many foreign governments characterized as fraudulent.
Formal U.S recognition of Guaido could be complicated, however, by questions of how to deal with Venezuela's U.S.-based diplomats and who would now control its bank accounts and other U.S. assets, which include Citgo, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].
The senior administration official told reporters that Washington now regards Guaido and the National Assembly as the ""legitimate decision-makers"" in transactions between the United States and Venezuela and that there would be a ""whole bunch of consequences,"" but declined to elaborate.
U.S. recognition of Guaido could backfire if Maduro, who accused the opposition of attempting a coup, used it as a pretext to detain Guaido or other opposition figures.
After Trump's announcement, most major Latin American countries made similar moves recognizing Guaido, and a Canadian official said Ottawa would also follow suit. But leftist-governed Mexico said it continued to recognize Maduro as president.
""@NicolasMaduro has undertaken a fight with the U.S. & international community he has no chance of winning,"" U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said in a message on Twitter.
Rubio, who led a delegation of Florida lawmakers to discuss Venezuela with fellow Republican Trump on Tuesday, is considered to have played a major role since Trump took office in convincing him to take a tougher stand against Maduro.
NEW OIL SANCTIONS
Multiple sources said the Trump administration could impose new U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry as soon as this week.
U.S. officials are considering a range of potential measures, including restricting U.S. imports of Venezuelan oil or even a full ban, but no final decisions have been made, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Two other sources briefed on the matter said the Trump administration informed U.S. energy companies of its deliberations.
The decision on whether to go ahead could depend on how harshly Maduro cracks down on protesters and how he responds to Guaido's swearing-in, several of the sources said.
Even then, the administration would likely hold further discussions that could delay any final move, one source said.
The Trump administration has been increasingly frustrated with existing sanctions on Venezuela, which have spared oil exports so far. Targeting oil shipments to the United States could choke off significant revenue to the OPEC member nation.
The United States has held off on broad, oil-related measures, mindful of the potential not only for deepening the hardships of the Venezuelan people but also the risk of causing problems for U.S. companies and consumers.
U.S. refiners such as  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and PBF Energy Inc (N:PBF) have had discussions about the possibility of such sanctions with the Trump administration in recent weeks.
Venezuelan crude exports to the United States last year fell 15 percent to the lowest annual average in nearly three decades, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Still, some U.S. refineries have equipment specifically designed for heavy grades of crude like those from Venezuela. They imported about 500,000 barrels per day last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 08:41PM ET</span>",Like a son but cheaper: harried South Koreans pamper pets instead of having kids,"By Hayoung Choi and Minwoo Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Kang Sung-il buys Sancho, his Pomeranian, a toy every business trip and this Lunar New Year holiday will dress him up in a new $50 suit to visit 'grandma', Kang's mother.
Kang and his wife say children are too expensive and bring too much pressure. Instead they have opted to shower Sancho with love and gifts.
They are not alone. South Korea's pet industry is booming, fueled by the same factors that have made the country's birth rate, at 1.05 births per woman, the lowest in the world: the high cost of education and housing as well as extremely long working days.
""Social pressures in South Korea are such that parents are required to provide resources for decades from private schooling to tutoring to art classes,"" said Kang, a 39-year old manager of a pet funeral home.
He says he found it hard to imagine being able to afford all that but is happy to spend about 100,000 won ($90) a month on Sancho.
On top of education expenses, an average South Korean household must budget roughly 12.8 years of income to buy a mid-range home, compared to 8.8 years in 2014, data from KB Kookmin Bank shows. Adding to their stress, South Koreans work the third most hours per year among OECD nations, lagging just Mexico and Costa Rica.
""The pet population is growing as more people choose not to have babies or even not to marry,"" said Kim Soo-kyung, manager at Samjong KPMG Economic Research Institute.
Pet-owning households have surged to 28 percent of all South Korean households in 2018, compared with 18 percent in 2012, government data shows.
That in turn has spurred a flourishing pet care industry whose offerings include tailored pet diets and high-priced photo shoots. Pet-related startups are also in vogue with venture capitalists.
The South Korean pet-related industry was worth 2.7 trillion won ($2.4 billion) last year, and that could more than double in size by 2027, according to the Korea Rural Economic Institute.
PET PROFITS
Firms seeking to profit from the boom include Pet Pick, which produces tailored food for over 10,000 animals. It is one of four pet startups to receive investments from GS Home Shopping, an online retailer that is part of the GS Holdings Corp conglomerate.
""We only use high quality ingredients, such as salmon and cranberry so our products are more than twice as expensive as regular dry pet food,"" Pet Pick co-founder Park Eun-byul said at the firm's Seoul factory.
""Many of our customers are millennials, who treat pets as their babies and are willing to pay more,"" Park said.
Leading venture capital fund, Korea Investment Partners, invested in two pet startups in 2018 - Bacon, which makes toys themed for holidays such as Christmas or Halloween, and Pet Friends, which promises to deliver pet products within one hour. The fund plans to invest in Picnic, which sells hand-made pet food, later this year.
Established firms are also cashing in. Meritz Fire & Marine Insurance saw more than 6,000 customers sign up in three months with a revamped pet insurance product launched in October, compared with roughly 100 per year for its earlier insurance program.
Sales of pet products at CJ ENM's TV and online shopping division rose three times last year, with a cactus-shaped water purifier for cats priced at over $100 doing particularly well.
""It's twice as expensive as an ordinary purifier but we sell dozens every day,"" said Lee Da-woon, who procures pet products for the online mall.
Pet funeral services are also increasingly popular and the home where Sancho's owner Kang works, now holds more than 10 services a day, compared with 3-5 when it opened two years ago.
In Namyangju, just outside Seoul, Lee Jae-hwan goes for a walk every day carrying an urn with the ashes of his dog Kkotgae, continuing the routine they used to share.
""I've always introduced Kkotgae as my only son, the most loved one in the world,"" 51-year-old Lee said in a tearful interview at home, next to a ceremonial table with photos, some food and burning incense. 

""He never saw the ocean. I wish we had visited together.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un spoke highly of U.S. President Donald Trump, state media said on Thursday, and expressed satisfaction over the results of talks between officials from both countries about a second summit between Kim and Trump. 
Kim said he would trust Trump's approach, the North's official KCNA news agency said, weeks after Kim warned North Korea could seek a ""new path"" if U.S. sanctions and pressure continued. That suggested Kim was focused on the next meeting with Trump to produce results.
""Kim Jong Un said that we will believe in President Trump's positive way of thinking, wait with patience and in good faith and, together with the U.S., advance step by step toward the goal to be reached by the two countries,"" KCNA said. 
It said Kim expressed ""large satisfaction"" at receiving a ""great"" letter from Trump and a briefing about the results of the negotiations from the North Korean delegation that visited Washington last week but did not elaborate. 
Kim ordered working-level preparations for the second North Korea-U.S. summit to be done well, KCNA said. The White House said last week a second Trump-Kim summit would be held in late February but did not say where.
That follows their landmark first summit in Singapore last June, which produced a promise to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Progress since then has been patchy. 
Kim has indicated to South Korean President Moon Jae-in he would undertake a ""groundbreaking"" denuclearization measure, South Korean newspaper DongA Ilbo reported on Thursday.
The newspaper, citing an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the U.S.-North Korea situation, said the same had been made clear to Trump during senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol's Washington visit last week.
North Korea has hinted, for example, at the possibility of agreeing to the U.S. demand for verification of denuclearization efforts before it discards its Yongbyon nuclear facilities.
In turn, the United States has mentioned potential measures such as easing limits on oil imports, a conditional restart of the Kaesong industrial zone in North Korea, and opening a liaison office in Pyongyang, DongA reported.
'NO RUSH'
DongA also said that, according to several South Korean government sources, talks between officials from North Korea, the United States and South Korea near Stockholm this week appeared to have been constructive in setting some of the agenda for the second Trump-Kim summit. 
The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the DongA report. 
The White House said after Trump met Kim Yong Chol, the North's chief nuclear negotiator, last week that economic sanctions against Pyongyang would be maintained despite agreeing to the second summit.
Trump has said there is ""no rush"" and ""no time limit"" on denuclearization negotiations, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has given varying statements about the degree of Washington's patience.
Pompeo said after the Singapore summit the United States hoped to achieve ""major disarmament"" by North Korea by the end of Trump's current term in office in January 2021. He has subsequently said he would not put a timeline on talks.
He told Fox News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday there had been progress in stopping North Korea's nuclear and missile-testing programs. 
""Chairman Kim continues to assure the President of the United States he is intent on denuclearization and I hope that at the end of February, when the two leaders get together, we can make a substantial step along the way,"" Pompeo said.

He said on Tuesday he saw an important role for the private sector in helping to develop North Korea if progress was made.

Lee Hsien Yang's comments come amid a bitter family dispute over the house of their father Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, and ahead of the vote, due by early 2021, but which the prime minister has suggested could be this year.
His ruling People's Action Party, which has governed the city-state since independence more than half a century ago, with its share of the vote never having dropped below 60 percent, now holds all but six of the 89 elected seats in parliament.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis wasted no time wading in on the standoff over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall on Wednesday as he started his trip to Panama, saying on the plane from Rome that hostility to immigrants was driven by irrational fear.
In a brief conversation between the pope and journalists on the flight, one reporter described the barrier that juts out into the Pacific Ocean between the two countries in San Diego, California, as a ""folly"".
Francis, who has made defense of migrants a key part of his papacy, responded: ""Fear makes us crazy"".
President Donald Trump, with whom the pope has sparred before on immigration, has triggered a U.S. government shutdown over demands for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the United States' southern border.
Immigration is expected to be one of the main themes of Francis's six-day trip. The pope met eight refugees in Rome before heading to the airport for his 13-hour flight to Panama for World Youth Day.
Since mid-October, thousands of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, have traveled north to the United States through Mexico in caravans, some walking much of the way.
Many are seeking asylum, saying they suffer from rampant crime and bleak opportunities in their native countries.
""Nobody wants to leave their country but young Salvadorans are doing it searching for opportunities, employment, security,"" said Edwin Valiente, a 28-year-old architecture student who came to Panama from El Salvador for Francis' visit.
Francis, on his first trip to Panama and the first by a pope since 1983, was greeted at the airport by President Juan Carlos Varela and thousands of cheering children.
World Youth Day has been dubbed the ""Catholic Woodstock"", a jamboree where young people celebrate their faith and discuss social issues. It is held in a different city every three years.
About 150,000 have registered for this year's event, being held in Latin America for only the third time since Pope John Paul instituted it in 1985.
Several hundred thousand people are expected at the final Mass at a park on Sunday that will be open to all visitors and citizens of the country of 4 million people, which is about 89 percent Catholic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sons of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman murdered a journalist well known for his coverage of drug cartels, a former associate testified at Guzman's U.S. trial on Wednesday.
Damaso Lopez Nunez, a former top lieutenant to Guzman, made the accusation in Brooklyn federal court under cross examination by one of Guzman's lawyers. The lawyer, Eduardo Balarezo, had asked Lopez whether his own son, Damaso Lopez Serrano, might have been involved in the May 2017 murder of Javier Valdez.
Valdez, known for his signature straw hat, was the founder of the RioDoce online newspaper and author of the book ""Narcoreporting"" about the dangers faced by journalists covering Mexico's drug war. His murder provoked public outcry about cartel violence.
RioDoce reported last year that Lopez Serrano was likely behind the killing.
Lopez said neither he nor his son had anything to do with Valdez's murder. He testified that Guzman's sons killed Valdez for publishing an article about drug cartel infighting against their wishes.
Guzman, 61, was extradited to the United States in 2017 and has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. His lawyers have claimed he was framed by another powerful drug trafficker, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada.
Acccording to media reports, Guzman has fathered as many as 15 children. Lopez did not say which sons murdered Valdez, but he previously testified that four - Ivan, Alfredo, Ovidio and Joaquin - were involved in the cartel.
Lopez, 52, is serving a life sentence in U.S. prison for drug trafficking and has said he is cooperating with prosecutors in the hope of getting the sentence reduced. He has testified that he began working for Guzman in 2001 and is godfather to one of his former boss' twin daughters. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Lopez testified that Guzman's wife, Emma Coronel, played a key role in plotting her husband's 2015 escape from a Mexican prison and tried to help him escape again after he was recaptured the following year.
Lopez told jurors that while Guzman was held in Mexico's Altiplano prison in 2014 and 2015, he plotted his boss' escape with Coronel and Guzman's sons, with Coronel passing messages to and from Guzman.
Lopez said the sons bought a plot of land near the prison from which to tunnel into Guzman's cell. Guzman escaped through the finished tunnel in 2015.
Guzman was recaptured in January 2016. Lopez said Coronel told him the following month that Guzman, then at Altiplano, wanted to duplicate his earlier escape.
That plan was thwarted when Guzman was moved to another prison in Ciudad Juarez, Lopez said, and a $2 million bribe to a national prison official to get him moved back was unsuccessful. Lopez did not identify the bribed official.
Coronel has never been charged with a crime.
When Lopez first stepped up to the witness stand on Tuesday, he looked at Guzman and bumped his fist to his chest. Asked by one of Guzman's lawyers on cross-examination Wednesday why he made the gesture, Lopez answered, ""Because I love him.""
Nonetheless, Lopez said, ""the circumstances"" compelled him to testify.

""I chose to think about my family,"" he said.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament approved the 2019 budget early on Thursday after an hours-long vote, ending weeks of deadlock over allocations to different provinces and privatization of state projects.
Parliament did not vote as planned on three cabinet posts that remain empty, however, leaving Iraq with an incomplete government months after a general election.
The budget projected oil exports of 3.88 million barrels per day, up from 3.8 million bpd for the previous year, at a price of $56 per barrel, an increase from the $46 the 2018 budget was based on.
Iraq's 2019 budget of 133 trillion dinars ($112 billion) included payment of salaries for the Peshmerga, the military force for the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, a move that lawmakers said might help ease tension between Baghdad and Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region.
The 3.88 million bpd of oil exports includes 250,000 from the Kurdish region. Exports from northern Kirkuk resumed after a year-long halt in November.
Iraq's oil exports from its southern Basra fields account for more than 95 percent of the OPEC producer's state revenue.
Kurdish lawmakers welcomed the move to pay salaries of their forces, even though these are not under the direct command of the Baghdad government.
""We are satisfied with the budget after approving the salaries for Peshmerga and the region's civil servants,"" Kurdish MP Aram Balati told Reuters.
Last year the budget cut the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) share from the 17 percent the region has traditionally received since the fall of Saddam Hussein, following a failed bid at full Kurdish independence from Baghdad in October 2017.
Lawmakers from southern predominantly Shi'ite Muslim provinces had bickered over budget allocations.
The vote had been delayed partly by those disputes and by a face-off between two Shi'ite-dominated political groupings which still cannot agree on the remaining cabinet appointments.
Lawmaker Mohammed Tamim said the budget's approval would ""help stabilize Iraq's economy and pave the way for the country's rebuilding.""

Iraq's infrastructure is wrecked after years of war against Islamic State and alleged corruption that has left thousands of people without power and water.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 06:25PM ET</span>",U.S.-backed forces about to end Islamic State's last enclave in Syria,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces are on the verge of eliminating Islamic State militants' last remaining enclave in Syria near the border with Iraq after a four-month devastating bombing campaign that has left hundreds of civilian casualties, residents and rebels said on Wednesday.
The capture of the village of Baghous comes after a string of other villages fell in recent days to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia alliance with aerial bombing strikes by the U.S.-led coalition.
The SDF, who launched a major offensive last September to remove the militants from their last pocket, were at first bogged down by fierce resistance, but advanced last month when they finally took the town of Hajin, the main urban stronghold in the enclave.
The SDF has now only a seven-kilometer stretch that separates them from full control of the entire east of the Euphrates River region, former residents and insurgents from the area say. 
Islamic State lost nearly all the territory it once held in Syria last year in separate offensives by the U.S.-backed SD and the Russian-backed Syrian army.
The conquest of the last pocket near the Iraqi border marks a major blow, leaving the militants scattered in sparsely populated desert areas in eastern Syria.
To compensate for the loss of territory, the ultra-hardline militants are now expanding hit-and-run assassinations of SDF fighters and commanders and attacks on checkpoints, security analysts say.
""The militants are changing tactics and adopting guerrilla methods and will be now using hundreds of their sleeper cells to wage deadly attacks,"" Sheikh Faisal Marashdah, a tribal leader, said.
Former residents in touch with relatives said at least 1,000 civilians left the enclave in the last 48 hours and handed themselves over to the Kurdish-led forces.
Among them were around 150 foreign fighters enlisted with the militants and their families. Kurdish sources said they were taken to an undisclosed high-security camp further north for screening. 
Resistance by an estimated several thousand militants fighting to the end collapsed after weeks of aerial bombing of the area that left many of the towns and villages in their hands on the banks of the Euphrates in ruins.
Residents and local activists have accused the U.S.-led coalition of indiscriminate bombing that they blame for killing dozens of civilians since the start of the campaign. The Pentagon says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing raids and investigates any allegations.

Scores of princes, top officials and businessmen were held in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November 2017. Critics decried the campaign as a shakedown and power play.
Dabbagh is chairman and chief executive of a family conglomerate, and for years headed the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, which aims to attract foreign investment to the country.
The others released this week, according to the sources who requested anonymity, are Hani Khoja and Sami al-Zuhaibi. They are co-founders of the consultancy Elixir, acquired in 2017 by McKinsey, which the Saudi government has contracted to help design economic and social reforms that Prince Mohammed is pushing to end dependence on oil revenues.
The men could not be reached, and the Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported their release.
The allegations against them and the terms of their release remain unclear. The public prosecutor has not provided an update on the anti-corruption campaign in nearly a year, deepening uncertainty in the local and international business communities.
Most of those detained were freed within a few months after reaching settlements the authorities said would net more than $100 billion. Some were reportedly tortured, which the government denies.
More people were later arrested and some are still believed to be detained, including former Economy Minister Adel Fakieh, Saudi Binladin Group Chairman Bakr bin Laden, and Saudi-Ethiopian billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi.
Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg in October that only eight people were still being held, and the finance minister told Reuters last month that cash settlements had generated some $13 billion in 2018 and would net ""not significantly"" less this year.
One former detainee, billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, has said he reached an agreement with the government for his release, without disclosing details.
Another, former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, was appointed foreign minister last month. A Saudi official told Reuters at the time of his release that Assaf had been cleared of any wrongdoing and without making any payment to the state.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top prosecutor on Wednesday called for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's government to respect the land rights of 900,000 indigenous citizens, which have been threatened by a wave of land invasions since he took office.
Bolsonaro has said he will not allow new reservations and he put indigenous land decisions under the Agriculture Ministry, a move that many saw as putting farmers' interests above those of native groups, who often making competing claims on land.
Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge said indigenous land rights were guaranteed in Brazil's constitution and the new government must explain its intentions because the international community is concerned about the future of Brazil's indigenous peoples.
""There can be no backsliding on public policies toward the indigenous people,"" she said at a conference attended by representatives of some of Brazil's 305 native tribes, advocacy groups and a dozen European nations.
Bolsonaro has said Brazil's tribes live in poverty and should be allowed to engage in commercial activities to improve their quality of life, including receiving royalties from mining companies operating on their land. Indigenous groups say such development threatens native cultures and languages.
Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who attended the event, defended Bolsonaro's plan to allow large-scale commercial farming on reservations, which is currently illegal. 
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, urged the Bolsonaro administration to comply with international agreements signed by Brazil that guarantee protections for native groups.
Indigenous people make up less than one percent of the nearly 211 million population and most live on reservations accounting for 12 percent of Brazil's territory, mainly in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
Joenia Wapichana, the first indigenous woman to be elected to Brazil's Congress in October, said Bolsonaro was inciting violence and hatred against her people.
""The invasions of indigenous land is a crime and the government has a constitutional obligation to stop them,"" she told reporters. She said the National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI), a government agency, has had its funds cut and deprived of tools to defend indigenous peoples.
A spokeswoman for Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias, who skipped the event because of last-minute rescheduling, said moving the land issues section of FUNAI to the ministry did not impinge on the constitution or any laws.

Dom Roque Paloschi, president of the Indigenous Missionary Council advocacy group, said farmers, loggers and miners in Rondonia state ""feel encouraged to invade indigenous land by this government"" and Bolsonaro's rhetoric about natives' excessive land claims.

Libya has been in conflict and chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with competing governments and armed groups vying for control. 
""The fact is that Salame has turned into an opponent ... and has become part of the Libyan crisis,"" LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said, adding that the deployment to the main southern city of Sabha would boost security for populations and oilfields. 
""Ghassan Salame should remember that this is a holy national duty and we will not leave Libya to be like Lebanon, a country of militias and multiple authorities,"" he told reporters in the eastern city of Benghazi.
Salame is from Lebanon.
Mismari said the U.N. official was surrounded by ""graduates"" of Tora Bora, the Afghan mountain hideout once used by the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The U.N. mission did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Salame has been trying to persuade Haftar and the other major Libya players to hold national elections. Haftar is linked to a eastern parallel government opposing the internationally recognized administration based in Tripoli.

The United Nations has been endeavoring to stabilize Libya since 2011 but has no peacekeeping troops on the ground.

Trump, struggling to get a request through the U.S. Congress for money to build a southern border wall, expressed frustration about governments in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador not helping the United States on the migrant problem.
""Honduras is doing nothing for us. Guatemala is doing nothing for us. El Salvador is doing nothing for us. And we pay them hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but we're going to be stopping pretty soon. In fact, we're looking at it right now,"" he said.
The Trump administration's proposed budget request for fiscal year 2019 included $45.7 million for El Salvador, $69.4 million for Guatemala and $65.8 million for Honduras, according to the Congressional Research Service. The amounts all represented a double-digit reduction from the previous year's funding.
Trump said he believed the three countries could ""very easily"" stop immigrant caravans from forming.

""I actually think they encourage the caravans because they want to get rid of the people from the country, and certain people,"" Trump told reporters during a meeting on immigration with members of his administration and high-profile Republicans.

Like other Arab countries, Morocco recalled its ambassador in Syria in 2011 after the outbreak of the anti-government protests.
""There should be an Arab coordination concerning Syria's return to the Arab League,"" Morocco's Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita told Al Jazeera TV channel. 
Morocco's foreign ministry was not immediately available for further comment.
Syria's membership of the Arab League was suspended in 2011 in response to the government's violent crackdown on protesters. For Syria to be reinstated, the Arab League must reach a consensus.
Arab states, including some that once backed rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, are seeking to reconcile with him after decisive gains by his forces in the war, aiming to expand their clout in Syria at the expense of non-Arab Turkey and Iran.
The Moroccan position on Syria comes after Lebanon's caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil called last Friday for reinstating Syria into the Arab League.
In December, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus marking a diplomatic boost for Assad from a U.S.-allied Arab state that once backed rebels fighting him.
The following day, Bahrain said its embassy in Damascus and the Syrian diplomatic mission in Manama had been operating.
Kuwait said it remained committed to the Arab League's decision and would reopen its embassy in Damascus once the organization allowed it.

Earlier in December, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir became the first Arab head of state to visit Damascus since the start of the Syrian conflict, flying into Damascus airport.

The protests, named after high-visibility vests French drivers are required to keep in their cars, started out in mid November against fuel tax hikes that have since been scrapped.
They quickly spiraled into a broader movement against the political elite and inequality, triggering some of the capital's worst street violence in decades.
""The citizen movement ... has shown the need to transform the anger into a political project capable of giving answers to the French people who have supported it,"" the loosely grouped movement said in a statement.
The movement, which so far has been loosely organized without a leadership structure, could take 13 percent of the vote in May, according to a Elabe poll on Wednesday for BFM TV. 
That would put it behind President Emmanuel Macron's party Republique en Marche (Republic On the Move) party with 22.5 percent and the far right Rassemblement National (National Rally) -- formerly the National Front -- with 17.5 percent.

Macron's party has recently seen a rebound in its poll scores in a sign of public approval for a harder stance he has taken against the protesters following a string of riots that left many store windows smashed and cars burnt.

His calls came after suspected ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) cadets assaulted members of the newly formed opposition United Transformation Movement and forced a woman to take off a UTM-branded T-shirt on Sunday, local media reported. 
The president ""has noted with great concern various acts of violence perpetrated with the probable intention of stirring disorder in the country as we approach the May general elections"", presidential press secretary Mgeme Kalilani said. 
The statement said the president would not tolerate ""any acts deliberately calculated at humiliating women on the political space and creating politics of anarchy"".
Malawians are set to go to the polls in May to elect a president, a parliament and ward councillors.
Mutharika, president since 2014, has been tipped to be re-elected, but regular allegations of corruption could hobble his campaign in the impoverished southern African nation where reports of government graft have become routine. The government denies allegations of corruption.
Mutharika directed the police to act decisively on ""any rogue elements"" who were promoting or perpetrating violence and said he would deploy ""any means necessary"" to ensure that the country was peaceful before and after the vote.
DPP spokesman Nicholas Dausi was quoted in local media on Tuesday as saying the party was waiting for a full investigation to determine whether the perpetrators of the T-shirt incident were DPP members. 

""There are instances where other parties wear ruling party uniforms when perpetrating violence. So let's wait for a full investigation,"" he said.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Congo's Kabila says he is 'without regret' ahead of power handover,"By Stanis Bujakera
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's outgoing President Joseph Kabila said he would hand over power on Thursday ""without regret"" and called on Congolese to support his successor, Felix Tshisekedi. 
Kabila has governed the vast central African country since succeeding his assassinated father in 2001 at the age of 29, in the midst of a regional war that led to millions of deaths. 
His refusal to quit power when his final term officially expired in 2016 led to deadly protests, but he finally agreed last year to step down following an election meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence. 
The Dec. 30 poll produced an unexpected winner in opposition leader Tshisekedi. Its credibility has been heavily questioned with the runner-up saying he actually won a landslide victory and accusing Kabila and Tshisekedi of a stich-up.
Kabila's and Tshisekedi's camps deny there was a deal or that results were rigged.
""Respectful of the constitution, I am going to hand over power tomorrow, without regret,"" said Kabila, wearing a black suit and tie and sporting his trademark salt-and-pepper beard, in pre-recorded remarks broadcast on national television.
""I invite you to massively support (Tshisekedi) as you have supported me,"" he said. 
He credited himself with accomplishments including reunifying the country and curtailing inflation. 
Still, his successor will assume power in one of the world's least developed countries, despite its copious output of copper, cobalt and other lucrative minerals. 
Tshisekedi, son of the late opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, is due to take power on Thursday in a ceremony at the presidential palace around mid-day. Many Congolese question whether he will be able to act independently, both because of question marks about a possible deal and the substantial influence Kabila's ruling coalition is set to retain. 
In legislative elections held alongside the presidential vote, Kabila's coalition won about 70 percent of national assembly seats, meaning the prime minister will come from its ranks. 
The federal bureaucracy and security services remain stacked with Kabila appointees, and he has refused to rule out running for president again in 2023 when he will no longer be constrained by term limits.
In his remarks, Kabila called for ""a coalition for a strong and prosperous Congo"" and one that would defend the country against ""predatory forces"" after its mineral riches. 
GROWING ACCEPTANCE 
Despite doubts about the election's credibility, Tshisekedi has won growing international acceptance in recent days by Western and African countries who fear that a protracted dispute could further destabilize Congo. 
On Wednesday, the United States voiced support for Tshisekedi, a sharp reversal from one of the countries most critical of the election, deploring a lack of transparency and even threatening sanctions. 
""The United States welcomes the Congolese Constitutional Court’s certification of Felix Tshisekedi as the next President,"" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said. 
""We are committed to working with the new DRC government ... We encourage the government to include a broad representation of Congo's political stakeholders and to address reports of electoral irregularities."" 
Neighbors Angola and Congo Republic also congratulated him.
Angolan President Joao Lourenco wished Tshisekedi ""success in carrying out the noble and difficult task entrusted to him by the Congolese people"". Angola is a longtime Kinshasa ally but relations were strained during a two-year delay in the election.
The statements came despite major flaws in the poll noted by domestic monitors, including outright vote tampering. Congo's Catholic Church, which deployed 40,000 election observers, found that runner-up Martin Fayulu actually won in a landslide.
Congolese sources in contact with senior officials told Reuters that Fayulu, also an opposition leader, had won decisively, but top officials instructed the electoral commission to award the vote to Tshisekedi, seen as more open to compromise with Kabila and his allies. 
The African Union, which last week expressed ""serious doubts"" about the credibility of the results, said on Tuesday it would work with Tshisekedi's government but declined to congratulate him, as did the European Union. 

Several other African governments have congratulated Tshisekedi, including South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi and Egypt.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>",Italy's prime minister promises to change Italy in two years,"By Alessandra Galloni
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - - Six months since entering politics, government and the international arena, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took to the stage of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday to talk up his administration's populist vision.
In a flurry of meetings, interviews and a speech, Conte, a Florence law professor, railed against the damage globalization had wrought on the middle classes and noted how disappointed Italians are with the European Union.
He said his government planned a massive upgrade of its physical and digital infrastructure, and played up a newly unveiled income-support program, saying it would help lift 5 million Italians out of poverty.
""Financial stability is very important, but more important is social stability and working...for the needs of the people,” Conte said in an interview.
In a subsequent speech, delivered in English with a smattering of Italian, he said Italy was focused on one thing: the “PEOPLE” (noted in capital letters in a handout of his official speech to the press).
""We are radical, but we are radical because we want to bring power back to where it was supposed to be, according to our Constitution, its people,"" said Conte, who was plucked from obscurity to lead the euro zone's third largest economy.
But by his own admission, Conte's government -- which comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League -- does not enjoy universal international goodwill.
The 54-year-old prime minister said his administration didn't ""have the trust of the international press"". He also rued that his government had a reputation for inaction, saying: ""It's not true. We are doing thousands of things.""
His more outspoken ministers have battled Brussels over EU budget restraints and have repeatedly denounced French President Emmanuel Macron, accusing him of sucking the wealth out of Africa and promoting an elitist vision of Europe.
Conte has often sought to play the peacemaker, but has struggled to overcome the strident voices of his deputy prime ministers -- League leader Matteo Salvini and 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio.
UPHILL
Reflecting his lower profile, Conte spoke before a thinly populated auditorium at Davos on Wednesday, hours after it was jam-packed for the address of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Conte was also not introduced by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who had earlier chaired the speeches of Merkel and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
In the corridors of the conference center, one European prime minister quipped that he wouldn't visit Italy until it ""changed its government"".
Italy's economy is also on an uphill trajectory. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its estimates for Italy's growth in 2019 to 0.6 percent, compared to the government's 1 percent target.
And Italy risks overstepping hard-fought agreements with the European Union over deficit targets too, but Conte urged investors to give his government more time to measure the effects of its growth agenda.
""Our reform plan will bloom in the spring,"" he said.
""I am convinced that by the end of the year we will have an incredible acceleration of growth and you'll see that at the end of the year we will surpass, by a large margin, the one percent growth laid out in our budget."" 
He also predicted that the spread between Italian and German bond yields, a gauge of market confidence, would rapidly fall from just above 250 basis points at present to some 150 points.
In the interview, Conte added that Europe faced an uncertain future, with many unresolved issues ""dragging on"", particularly on immigration where he said the EU was exposing its weakness.
But to young Italians who have emigrated in droves in recent years in search of jobs, he promised a Renaissance back home based on investments in digital enhancements -- although he did not give details. 
It cost Italy 80,000 euros ($91,000) to put someone through university, Conte said. ""So a young person who is trained in Italy and then leaves represents a huge economic loss.""
""We are really changing Italy,"" he said. ""Give me one or two years, and you will find another Italy.""

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The United States has assured Afghanistan's government that any U.S. troop pullout would not affect the combat abilities of remaining forces, Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said on Wednesday.
Abdullah said news last month that President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw 5,000 U.S. troops had caused unease in the government, which is battling resurgent Taliban forces who control broad swathes of the country outside the main cities.
Since then, however, U.S. officials had told the Afghan government that no final decision had been made, and that Washington remained committed to supporting Afghan defense and security institutions, he said. 
""Of course initially it came with some concerns for all of us,"" Abdullah told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. 
""Later on, through engagement with their envoys and representatives we learned that even if the (U.S.) withdraws, it would be partial, it would not have an impact on the combat abilities,"" he said. 
He did not say how the United States, if left with fewer than 9,000 troops, would still be able to maintain multiple missions including training Afghan forces, advising them in the field and waging air strikes against the Taliban and other militants.
Trump has been impatient for progress in ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan, where more than 2,400 U.S. forces have died.
The United States sent troops to Afghanistan after the al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, and overthrew its Taliban rulers, who had hosted Osama bin Laden's organization.
At its peak the U.S. deployment involved more than 100,000 troops, but Washington withdrew most in 2014 and now has around 14,000 troops in the country as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants.
""The presence will not come to an end - only if there is peace in Afghanistan,"" Abdullah said. ""So those details which came out later on kept us assured to some extent.""
Abdullah, who is standing in Afghanistan's presidential election in July, defended his alliance with General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who has been accused of serious human rights abuses. He said Dostum's Junbish-i Milli party had strong support in northern Afghanistan.
""You cannot ignore part of the population because there are allegations against this person or that person,"" he said. ""We can’t just wish people away.""
Abdullah is challenging President Ashraf Ghani, who defeated him in a 2014 election which Abdullah said was marred by fraud. They later agreed to form a national unity government with Ghani as president and Abdullah as chief executive officer.

This year's vote ""has to be clean,"" Abdullah said. ""The flaws of the previous election have to be corrected. Am I absolutely confident that this will be transparent as we would expect? That’s difficult to judge at this stage.""

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William revealed on Wednesday that ""not one celebrity"" had originally wanted to join a mental health campaign he started in 2016 with his wife Kate and brother Harry.
""We went out to a lot of people and nobody, before we started, was interested in being a part of 'Heads Together' – because it was mental health,"" he said, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. 
William, who is second in line to the British throne, also opened up about his experiences of dealing with trauma during his daily work in the air ambulance, which he retired from two years ago.
Remembering a particularly affecting incident, he said: “I know if I hadn’t taken the action I did then, I would have definitely gone down a slippery slope and I would have been dealing with mental illness on a different level.""
His fellow panelist, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, praised the prince for speaking out about mental health issues.
Ardern, at 38 the world’s youngest female head of government, has said she will introduce New Zealand's first ‘well-being budget’ to gauge how policy impacts the quality of people’s lives.
""I think unfortunately one of the sad facts for New Zealand is that everyone knows someone who has taken their own life. We're a small country, less than 5 million people, but last year more than 600 people committed suicide,"" she said. 
""I’ve lost friends and I wouldn't have to look far in my cabinet to find others who have as well,"" Ardern added.
William, who has previously warned British men of the dangers of keeping a traditional ""stiff upper lip"" at times of stress, said he thought his country’s difficulties with expressing emotions came from a wartime generation who passed on a tendency not to talk about problems. 

Asked what he thought leaders should do to tackle mental health issues, William told the Davos crowd: ""I think more leaders need to talk about it.""

The outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever in the eastern provinces of North Kivu and Ituri is already the second-largest in history with 713 confirmed and probable cases and 439 deaths. 
It is surpassed only by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, which involved over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths and led to substantial investments in a vaccine and treatments for the virus. 
Health officials have struggled to bring the current outbreak, Congo's tenth since 1976, under control, largely due to widespread militia violence in eastern Congo which has hampered the response. 
The health ministry said in a daily bulletin that nine of the new cases were in the health zone of Katwa, just outside Butembo, a city of several hundred thousand people near the Ugandan border that has emerged as the outbreak's new epicenter. One other case was in Butembo. 

The ministry also announced six new deaths of confirmed cases as well as the recovery of one patient.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday after which the Russian leader said the two men had discussed how they planned to stabilize the situation in Syria's Idlib province. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier on Wednesday that the situation in the region, where Moscow and Ankara have tried to create a de-escalation zone, was rapidly deteriorating and that it was almost under the full control of Nusra militants.
Putin said the Russian and Turkish defense ministers had already held talks on specific action that the two countries would take in Idlib and that the measures, which he didn't describe, would now be implemented. 
""Unfortunately there are many problems there and we see them,"" said Putin, standing alongside Erdogan.
He said Turkey was doing a lot to try to remedy the situation, but that more action by both Ankara and Moscow was required to ""liquidate the actions of terrorist groups."" 
Putin said he had agreed to host a summit soon where Russia, Turkey and Iran would discuss the situation in Syria. He did not name a date for the summit, but said he and Erdogan had agreed on its provisional timing. 

The Russian leader also complained about the difficulty of forming a U.N.-sponsored constitutional committee for Syria, saying that France, Germany and Britain had blocked the proposed make-up of the committee in December, a move he said had come as a surprise for Moscow.

""A party is represented here today that disparages those (democratic) values and downplays the crimes of the National Socialists,"" Charlotte Knobloch, a Holocaust survivor and President of the Jewish Community in Munich, told the regional assembly.
All but four AfD lawmakers in the Bavarian lower house stood up and left the hall as legislators from the other five parties applauded Knobloch.
The AfD, which has always rejected charges of racism, entered the Bavarian parliament for the first time in a regional election last year, winning 22 seats to become the fourth largest party, on a par with the centre-left Social Democrats.
The rise of the AfD, which has representatives in all of Germany's 16 regional assemblies, has alarmed Jewish leaders who accuse it of contributing to a rise in anti-Semitism.
The AfD also entered the lower house of the federal parliament in Berlin, the Bundestag, for the first time in a national election last year, drawing support from a broad array of voters angry with Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost a million, mainly Muslim asylum seekers.
""HATE AND EXCLUSION""
""The so-called AfD bases it politics on hate and exclusion and doesn't abide by our democratic constitution,"" Knobloch said in her speech, given in remembrance of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis.
Katrin Ebner-Steiner, the AfD's parliamentary leader in Bavaria, defended her colleagues' protest walkout.
""It is scandalous that the president of the Jewish community in Munich abused a memorial service for the victims of Nazism to defame the whole AfD and its legitimate and democratically elected faction using evil blanket insinuations,"" she said.
Knobloch later told Reuters she was not surprised when AfD lawmakers walked out on her speech.
""The supportive reaction from the democratic factions made me really happy,"" she wrote in an email. ""Democrats in our country must stand against the AfD also in the future."" 
German politicians in June rebuked AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland after he said Hitler and the Nazis ""are just bird shit in 1,000 years of successful German history"".

Two years ago, Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD's leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, triggered anger after he told supporters that Berlin's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was a ""memorial of shame"" and that history books should be rewritten to focus more on German victims.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The countries overseeing the long-stalled peace talks between Colombia's government and longtime ELN insurgency were divided on Wednesday over Havana's refusal to extradite 10 rebel leaders following a bomb attack in Bogota last week that killed 21 people. 
Colombia President Ivan Duque reactivated Interpol red notices against the leaders from the National Liberation Army (ELN) after the car bomb blast at a police academy in the capital city, whose victims were mostly young police cadets.
Guarantors Cuba and Norway do not support extradition, while Chile said on Tuesday it does. Venezuela and Brazil have not yet commented. 
Growing fears that Colombia may now face a fresh wave of bombings have scuppered hopes that talks might resume in the near future.
Cuba has condemned the bombing but said it would follow protocols agreed at the start of negotiations in 2017. These provide security guarantees for guerrilla commanders to return to Colombia or Venezuela within 15 days of an end to talks and bar military offensives for 72 hours. 
The rebel leadership has remained in Havana, where the talks were taking place. 
Norway said on Tuesday it also backed use of the protocols.
Duque has said the protocols do not apply since his government never participated in talks. Some analysts say the country will be obliged to accept the protocols despite the change in presidential administrations. 
""What I ask of (Norway) and all the governments is that they understand that what happened last week was not a divergence of opinions, what happened was an international crime that ended the lives of many undefended, unarmed youths,"" Duque told journalists at the World Economic Forum. 
Duque had refused to restart the negotiations, begun by his predecessor, until the ELN freed all hostages and stopped criminal activities.
Though the notoriously decentralized ELN claimed responsibility and called the attack a legitimate attack of war, its leaders in Cuba have said they were not involved.
Last week ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas drove an SUV packed with 80 kilograms (176 lbs) of explosive pentolite onto the grounds of the police academy.
The subsequent explosion killed 20 cadets between the ages of 18 and 23 and Rojas himself.
Though bombings were common during the height of the Andean country's 50-year internal conflict, recent rebel attacks have largely focused on oil infrastructure.
Police stations were targeted in a series of ELN bombings in early 2018 and one of Bogota's most upscale malls was bombed in 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - An attempt by British lawmakers to prevent a no-deal Brexit was gaining momentum on Wednesday after the opposition Labour Party said it was highly likely to throw its parliamentary weight behind that.
The United Kingdom, facing the deepest political crisis since World War Two, is due to leave the European Union at 2300 GMT on March 29 but has no approved deal on how the divorce will take place.
Prime Minister Theresa May is battling to break the deadlock after last week's crushing defeat of her two-year attempt to forge an orderly divorce raised the prospect of an exit without a deal.
In a step that could overturn centuries of constitutional convention, some lawmakers are trying to grab control of Brexit from the government in an attempt to prevent what they say would be an economically disastrous no-deal departure.
Labour is likely to back one such attempt, an amendment proposed by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper that could result in May being given until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament or face lawmakers voting on delaying Brexit. 
John McDonnell, the second most powerful figure in the party, told the BBC the amendment was sensible and that Labour was ""highly likely"" to back it. At least nine Conservative lawmakers have also publicly said they will support it, suggesting it has a good chance of passing.
Sterling jumped to a 10-week high against the dollar, rising to $1.3079, on bets that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided if parliament exerts greater control over the process.
As the United Kingdom's tortuous crisis over EU membership approaches its finale, the possible outcomes for the world's fifth largest economy still include a no-deal Brexit, a last-minute deal, a delay or a snap election.
LONDON CALLING?
But the EU, whose members are also worried by the prospect of a disorderly Brexit that would cost jobs in major economies such as Germany, cautioned that no-deal was still the default scenario until London proposed something else.
""Preparing for a no-deal scenario is more important now than ever, even though I still hope that we can avoid this scenario,"" EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told a gathering of employers and labor organizations in Brussels.
""Opposing no-deal will not stop no-deal from happening,"" he said, adding it would be necessary for the British to find a majority in favor of another solution to a disorderly exit.
Europe's most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said she wanted an orderly Brexit but that it was in London's hands.
May has said thwarting Brexit would threaten social cohesion because it would undermine faith in British democracy, while police have said the ""febrile"" atmosphere could be exploited by far-right extremists.
Another alternative is that May gets enough concessions from the EU to win over rebels in her Conservative Party as well as the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government. 
Some said they could be won over if May secures concessions on the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to keep the border open between the British province and Ireland if a future trade deal falls short.
""I think there is good news for us to hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable,"" lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said. ""But ... it is not there yet and until it is, people like me will vote against.""
DELAYED BREXIT
Parliament will vote on Jan. 29 on different options put forward by lawmakers, potentially opening a way out of the stalemate.
A Labour spokesman said the party would ""look at all mechanisms to take no deal off the table and to give parliament more of a say in this process"" and that leader Jeremy Corbyn was meeting Cooper on Wednesday to discuss the amendment.
If the Cooper amendment is passed, it would effectively give parliament the power to set May a deadline of Feb. 26 to get a deal through parliament.
If May fails, parliament would be given a vote on asking the EU for a postponement of the Article 50 deadline to prevent Britain leaving without a deal on March 29. It proposes a nine-month extension, to Dec. 31.
If Britain asked to delay its departure under Article 50 of the EU treaty, the other 27 members of the bloc would need to unanimously approve such a move, something EU officials say would be likely to be granted.
May told parliament the move would not solve the issue of the impasse in parliament over the way forward.

""What we have seen is amendments seeking to engineer a situation where Article 50 is extended - that does not solve the issue, there will always be a point of decision. The decision remains the same: no deal, a deal or no Brexit,"" she said.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Why Davos is talking about the fight between two absentees,"By Simon Robinson
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The two most powerful men in the world are not in Davos this year, but they remain impossible to escape.
In a sweeping speech at the World Economic Forum two years ago, President Xi Jinping argued that China was free trade's greatest champion. Any attempt to stop the flow of capital, technology, goods, industries or people between economies ""is simply not possible,"" he said. 
Then in January last year, President Donald Trump arrived at the Swiss ski village to deliver his own ""simple message: There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business."" 
Washington was committed to free trade, he said. But ""we cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.""
Neither leader mentioned their superpower rival. But it was clear that in setting out their boundaries for how global trade should work, they were talking to each other. 
If the last year is anything to go by, neither much listened. And the fallout from their falling out is why there's so much talk about Xi, Trump and trade at this year's Forum. 
Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, told the audience at one session that some countries – she did not name which – were starting to pull away from the rules-based multilateral system built up over the past few decades. ""If that is no longer the mainstream, we could be in trouble,"" she said. 
Kevin Sneader, Global Managing Partner at McKinsey & Company, said that trade was just ""one aspect of a broader tension between the U.S. and China.""
Already, the trade war between the two biggest economies in the world has begun to crimp global growth, to reshape supply chains and corporate planning, and to hit countries from Canada to Singapore. The International Monetary Fund trimmed its growth forecasts on the eve of this year's Davos meeting, while a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs.
In the real world, the effects have been felt for months.
Take Foxconn (TW:2354), which assembles Apple (O:AAPL) iPhones in China but now says it is considering building factories in Vietnam and India to help mitigate any impact from the trade war.
Or automakers, who are busy changing where they build certain models to account for increased tariffs.
Or countries such as Australia, whose currency, winemakers and home owners are all feeling the chill of the economic battle.
People want to know ""how much has the economy slowed and from a trade perspective what are these tariffs and what impact are the trade discussions really having,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) CEO Michael Corbat in an interview with Reuters.
THE VIEW FROM WASHINGTON AND BEIJING
The U.S. delegation stayed at home this year thanks to the government shutdown. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke via video link. He began by describing China as belligerent toward its neighbors and ""embracing totalitarianism"" at home, but went on to say that Washington's issues with Beijing could be resolved if China accepted the principles of fair and open trade and protection of intellectual property.
A U.S. official, speaking in Washington a few days before the Davos conference, said that Trump's message at the event last year still applied. A lot of progress had been made, he said, citing the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico as one example.
The imposition of tariffs on China had got Beijing talking, he argued, a major development since last year's Davos.
In China, views are divided.
Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said the trade war may ultimately push China to open up further - even if this would not be easy.
When Xi spoke at Davos two years ago, he ""was paying more attention to politics."" The trade war could force China to focus on economics, he said.
However, a senior analyst at a major Chinese state-owned company told Reuters that Xi could never back down when confronted with U.S. demands for reform. Such a move would be more politically dangerous than navigating an economic downturn, the analyst said.

""If the Chinese government kneels down to the American president, it will give rise to intense dissatisfaction from the people, and it would be a major political loss within the government.""

881,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Next U.S.-North Korea summit must give concrete results: Seoul,"By Soyoung Kim and Alessandra Galloni
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - A planned second summit next month between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un must ""deliver concrete results on denuclearization"", South Korea's top diplomat said on Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the two leaders should make ""really great big strides"" on the road to denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula, in line with international demands.
Trump and Kim met in Singapore last June for an unprecedented summit, producing a promise to work toward ""complete denuclearization"" of the peninsula, but the two sides have since struggled to agree how to implement the pledge.
Critics of U.S. efforts say that summit only boosted Kim's international stature while doing little to curb Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal that now threatens the United States.
After Trump met Pyongyang's top nuclear negotiator, Kim Yong Chol, in Washington on Friday, the White House announced that the second summit would take place in late February.
The two sides have given no sign of having narrowed their differences over U.S. demands that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and Pyongyang's demands for a lifting of economic sanctions and a formal end to the Korean War.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, given the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
The North Korean envoy's recent visit to Washington has put nuclear talks ""back on track"", Kang said in Davos. Details of the second summit would continue to be negotiated despite a partial government shutdown in Washington, she added.
Trump did not elaborate on the country chosen to host the summit, but Vietnam has been considered a leading candidate.
Earlier on Wednesday, Kang met with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum to discuss the planned second summit between Washington and Pyongyang, Seoul's foreign ministry said in a statement.
Kono agreed that ""concrete results"" will have to be made toward denuclearization, while stressing that Japan expects close communication and coordination with South Korea on the nuclear negotiations regardless of ""several pending issues"" between the neighbors, the ministry said.
The two U.S. allies share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.
The rows between the neighbors flared again in late October when South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401) must compensate South Koreans for their forced labor during World War Two. Japan maintains that the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, and has denounced the ruling as ""unthinkable.""
Wartime history has long been a stumbling block for relations between the neighbors, sparking concern about regional efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear program.
In the latest escalation of tensions, a Japanese patrol aircraft made an ""intimidating"" pass over a South Korean warship on Wednesday, in what South Korea's military said was a ""clear provocation"" toward a friendly neighbor.

Kang expressed ""regret"" over the incident and urged defense authorities from the two countries to resolve the issue soon, the foreign ministry said.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",Germany seeks extension of EU's migrant deterrent sea operation,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN/ROME (Reuters) - Germany said on Wednesday it was pushing for a solution to disputes over the distribution of migrants rescued at sea so Europe's naval security mission can continue beyond March.
The European Union launched ""Operation Sophia"" in 2015 to counter migrant smugglers in the Mediterranean and reduce arrivals. But its future is uncertain given Italy's insistence that those rescued be distributed among EU countries instead of being brought mostly to Italian ports.
With management of the migrant crisis damaging unity in the 28-nation bloc, the EU in December extended the Rome-based mission by three months to give time for a solution. 
But EU sources say that will be tough.
""We must find a solution at the European level that extends beyond March 31,"" said German government spokeswoman Martina Fietz. 
By strengthening the coastguard of Libya, from where most migrants have in recent years attempted the perilous journey to Europe, the operation has pared arrivals from more than a million in 2015 to a tenth of that in 2018.
Despite that, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has pushed to change the mission's mandate, which dictates that people saved at sea must be delivered to the closest and safest ports, in most cases Italy.
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said the German navy had rescued a total of 22,000 migrants at sea since 2015, but had recently been sidelined by Italian commanders.
""For three quarters of a year, the Italian command has been sending our navy to the most remote areas of the Mediterranean where there are no smuggling routes and no migrant flows so that the navy has not had any sensible role for months,"" she said.
Berlin this week decided not to replace its ship the Augsburg when its tour ends on Feb. 6, although it said another vessel would be standing by in the North Sea if needed.
According to Italian defence ministry figures, Operation Sophia had rescued only 106 migrants in the past seven months, while Libya's coast guard has picked up 13,000 in the same period. 
Salvini told reporters Italy would continue to support the mission until March 31 while continuing to insist on new rules ensuring migrants also go to other states. 
""It's not Italy that is leaving the Sophia mission,"" he said, in an apparent reference to Germany's decision not to replace the Augsburg in the Mediterranean for now.

In Brussels, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU's Commissioner for Migration, said he believed the operation was valuable and should continue, though its fate was largely in Italy's hands.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: The cash crunch behind Zimbabwe's violent protests,"By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti-government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel.
Lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people, wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations. Zimbabwe's Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) accused security forces of systematic torture.
Critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterized the 37-year regime of former leader Robert Mugabe, who was forced from power after a coup in November 2017.
The crisis will not be easy to fix. There is a severe shortage of dollars, fuel and medicines, while inflation hit 42 percent in December, the highest in a decade. Foreign investors are, by and large, staying away.
WHAT SPARKED THE LATEST CLASHES?
Everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals. In the past two months, the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods, including medicines, food and fuel.
Motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations, where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line.
On Jan. 12, Mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to $3.31 per liter from $1.32 from midnight, but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash U.S. dollars.
It was the final straw for some Zimbabweans, and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement.
Some residents say that while calm has returned, soldiers have continued to beat up civilians.
Many people blame Mnangagwa for failing to fulfill his pre-election promises to kick-start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong-arm rule of his predecessor.
GENESIS OF CASH SHORTAGES
The country abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before. In its place, the government adopted the U.S. dollar and other currencies including sterling and the South African rand.
People hoped the move would spell the end of spiraling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless.
But over time, supply of the U.S. and South African currencies dried up, so in November 2016 authorities in Harare launched a surrogate currency - paper 'bond notes' designed to ease acute hard currency shortages.
The notes, which now have a total face value of $400 million, are backed by a $500 million loan from the African Export and Import Bank, the central bank has said. They are used like cash.
Officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1:1, on the street $1 fetches up to 3 bond notes, reflecting the ongoing shortage of U.S. dollars and people's desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency.
A dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as $30 in bond notes. Companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits.
""ZOLLARS""
When the bond note was introduced, dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value.
Government borrowing via Treasury Bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold.
It is these electronic dollars, theoretically worth $10 billion and nicknamed ""zollars"" by economists, that are raising fears that Zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade.
Zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments.
Zollars remain officially pegged at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, but on the black market $1 is now worth $4 zollars. That has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments.
Zimbabwe's foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks' cover for imports, central bank data show.
The government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves. But Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said Zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months.
HOW ARE BUSINESSES AFFECTED?
Companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment, forcing them to buy dollars on the black market.
Civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country. Only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies, charities, or large international corporations are paid in U.S. dollars.
Last October, the central bank ordered banks to create separate U.S. dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas, which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar. 
The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch. The group said its members had a backlog of $480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers. 
Cooking oil and soap maker Olivine Industries said on Saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers $11 million.
Zimbabwe's largest brewing company Delta Beverages, part-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened.
WHAT'S NEXT?
Mnangagwa, a former spy chief installed after Mugabe's removal in a coup in November 2017, was elected in July amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for Zimbabwe, and has said his nation is ""open for business"".
But critics say the man nicknamed ""The Crocodile"" is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms, including repealing Mugabe-era laws that restrict the media.
Mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions against officials from the ZANU-PF ruling party, top military figures and some government-owned firms, which were imposed during Mugabe's rule for what Washington called violations of human rights and democracy.
The IMF has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country's reform program unless its $2 billion arrears with the World Bank, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank are paid.
Harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a program allowing the IMF to monitor its economic reforms, although it does not entail funding from the lender.

Analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now, but more clashes were expected unless Mnangagwa's administration could find a solution to the cash shortages.

Karins' coalition consists of five of the seven parties in parliament, excluding only the pro-Russia Harmony party and the Union of Greens and Farmers.
The U.S.-born Karins, 54, said his government aimed to clean up Latvia's financial system, mired in money-laundering scandals, and to tackle corruption. 
Latvia's central bank governor is awaiting trial on charges of accepting a bribe, which he denies. One of the biggest banks, ABLV, went into liquidation last year after U.S. authorities accused it of laundering vast amounts of money for clients in the former Soviet Union.
""This is actually a threat to our whole society. We need to address this threat,"" Karins, a former economy minister and linguistics professor, said in a speech to parliament before the vote confirming him as prime minister.
October's general election delivered a highly fragmented parliament and Karins' New Unity, holding just eight seats out of 100, is the smallest of seven parties.
The Harmony party, which is supported by ethnic Russians who make up a quarter of Latvia's population, is the biggest party with 23 seats, but other parties have shut it out of power.

Israel has repeatedly attacked what it describes as Iranian targets in Syria and those of allied militia, including Lebanon's Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describes the effort as an open-ended campaign to push back arch-foe Tehran.
The strikes have long caused friction between Israel and Russia, which apart from Iran is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's other major foreign backer.
Israeli officials have spoken in the past of an agreement with Moscow under which they have made clear their strikes on Syria would not threaten Assad, while Russia has promised to help limit Iranian influence near the Israeli frontier. A hotline set up since 2015 is aimed at ensuring Russian forces in Syria are not surprised by Israeli attacks.
""The practice of arbitrary strikes on the territory of a sovereign state, in this case, we are talking about Syria, should be ruled out,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, in answer to a question from Russian news agency TASS about recent Israeli air strikes on Syria. 
She said such strikes added to tensions in the region, which she said was not in the long-term interests of any country there, including Israel.
""We should never allow Syria, which has suffered years of armed conflict, to be turned into an arena where geopolitical scores are settled,"" TASS cited her as saying.
Her comments follow Israeli strikes in Syria on Monday. Israel did not immediately respond.
Earlier on Wednesday, Netanyahu signalled that the Syria sorties would continue. 

""The IDF (Israel Defence Force) is the only military that is fighting the Iranian army in Syria,"" he said during a visit to an Israeli army base. ""I am certain in our ability to defeat the enemy.""

886,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 07:57AM ET</span>",Asylum applications in Germany fall for second year in a row,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Fewer people applied for asylum in Germany last year, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Wednesday, putting the second yearly slide in a row down to restrictive measures introduced by the government after a record influx in 2015.
Immigration remains a contentious topic in Germany, four years after Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome a record 890,000 asylum applicants, mainly Muslims fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The latest figures show that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has met its target to limit the number of asylum seekers to between 180,000 and 220,000 a year.
About 162,000 asylum applications were registered in 2018, a 13 percent drop from the 186,000 requests recorded a year earlier.
The applicants included 32,000 infants under the age of one who were born in Germany to asylum-seeking mothers, Seehofer said.
Syrians remained by far the largest group of applicants with 46,000, followed by Iraqis and Afghans, who numbered 18,000 and 12,000 respectively. 
Seehofer almost brought down Merkel's coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD) last year with demands for stricter controls on Germany's border with Austria, the main gateway for migrants.
Both Merkel's conservatives and the SPD were punished in a 2017 election by voters angry about their welcoming asylum policies, which propelled the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party into the Bundestag lower house for the first time.
The government has tried to cut asylum arrivals with restrictive measures such as limiting to 1,000 a month the number of people who can join their loved ones in Germany under family reunification laws for refugees.
Germany has also been granting asylum to fewer applicants. Last year around 35 percent of applications were positive, down from 43 percent in 2017.

But the main reasons for the gradual drop in arrivals are down to factors beyond Germany's control, including a drop in the level of violence in Syria and Iraq.

(Reuters) - Iowa's ""fetal heartbeat"" law, the most restrictive abortion ban in the United States, was declared unconstitutional Tuesday, as it violates the Iowa state constitution, a state judge ruled.
Iowa's Republican-controlled legislature passed the restriction in May 2018, outlawing the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected, often at six weeks and before a woman realizes she is pregnant.
In the ruling, posted online, District Court Judge Michael Huppert wrote, ""It is undisputed that such cardiac activity is detectable well in advance of the fetus becoming viable."" 
A fetus that is viable outside the womb, usually at 24 weeks, is widely considered the threshold in the United States to prohibit an abortion.
The district court decision is a victory for supporters of abortion rights, but abortion opponents have vowed to take the fight to Iowa's appellate courts, the Des Moines Register and other media reported.
The legislation is aimed at triggering a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision which established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, activists on both sides of the issue previously told Reuters.
Iowa state Sen. Janet Petersen of Des Moines, the Democrats' leader in the Iowa Senate, praised the ruling.
“The extreme law should have been overturned, because it restricted the freedom of Iowa women and girls to care for their bodies, and it forced motherhood on them,"" she told the Register. ""The governor and legislative Republicans should stop attacking women’s health care.""
Proponents of the law had expected a long court fight.
The ultimate goal, abortion opponents have told multiple media outlets, is to get the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has become more conservative under President Donald Trump.
When the Iowa law was first passed, Republican state senator Rick Bertand of Sioux City told Reuters, ""We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v. Wade - 100 percent.""

888,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>","Caracas Spring? Not so fast, Venezuela's armed forces say","By Brian Ellsworth and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - Buoyed by a telegenic new congressional chief, Venezuela's opposition is daring to hope that President Nicolas Maduro's days in office could be numbered, but the unpopular leader's bedrock base - the armed forces - shows few signs of erosion.
Opposition sympathizers, rallying around opposition leader Juan Guaido, are holding open air town-hall meetings that buzz with excitement about the legislature's recent challenges to the legitimacy of Maduro, who this month began a new term widely slammed as illegitimate. 
Bolstered by the United States and numerous Latin American neighbors promising to back the opposition in seeking a transition, the Guaido-led congress last week declared Maduro a ""usurper"" and asked foreign governments to freeze bank accounts controlled by his government.
But with the legislature stripped of its powers by a pro-government Supreme Court and few signs that the military high command is prepared to abandon Maduro, the spring in the opposition's step and investor exuberance it has sparked may prove premature.
""The military leadership is faithful to Maduro and will continue to be until he's gone,"" said one active duty high-ranking military officer, who asked not to be identified.
An attack on a Caracas military output by two dozen low-ranking National Guard officers on Monday morning sparked opposition hopes of an uprising, but the incident was snuffed out quickly.
""A sergeant at a National Guard outpost is not to me important, what would be important is a situation like that in a major unit or a battalion,"" said Rocio San Miguel, a military expert with non-profit group Citizen Control. 
Congress has declared Maduro illegitimate and promised a transition to a new government, bringing new energy to an opposition that has kept a low profile since protests in 2017 that left 125 people dead but failed to shake Maduro.
The excitement has spread from the streets of Caracas to the trading rooms of Wall Street, where investors have driven up the prices of the country's defaulted bonds on hopes for a new government that will be more likely to resume debt payments.
Guaido got another U.S. vote of confidence on Tuesday as Vice President Mike Pence issued a video message of support for those protesting against Maduro.
AMNESTY PROPOSAL
Soldiers have many reasons to be angry.
Military installations are steadily decaying along with the rest of the country, and salaries quickly disappear amid 2 million percent annual inflation.
More than 4,000 low-ranking officers deserted last year, according to official documents seen by Reuters.
Opposition legislators are developing an amnesty proposal meant to coax disgruntled military leaders into turning on Maduro, based on what they say are conversations with active officers who are eager for change.
Cliver Alcala, a retired army general who was close to late socialist leader Hugo Chavez but fell out with the ruling Socialist Party in 2016, said the disputed inauguration has damaged Maduro's image among troops. 
""The barracks are not totally convinced that Maduro really is president,"" said Alcala in a telephone interview from Colombia.
But Maduro has worked hard to keep the military on side, well aware of its crucial role.
He has put officers in charge of key posts in the government and state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], while offering lucrative oilfield services contracts for military-linked firms.
And authorities have pursued military personnel suspected of plotting against the government, which human rights groups say has led to torture of suspected dissidents and abuse of family members.
The armed forces will also be sensitive to the lessons of the 20th century. Promises of a military ""quick fix"" to political instability in Latin American countries including Brazil and Chile gave rise to dictatorships that lasted for as long as 21 years and were later demonstrated to have abysmal records on human rights.
And so, the armed forces have remained silent as the economic collapse has left millions struggling to eat.

Military leaders are ""not in the slightest bit concerned about maintaining their professional commitments,"" said the high-ranking military officer. ""They're concerned about protecting themselves.""

Washington has threatened to pull out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), alleging that the new Russian missile, the Novator 9M729 (called SSC-8 by NATO), violates the pact, which bans either side from stationing short and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe.
Russia says the missile's range puts it outside the treaty altogether and is not as long as Washington alleges, meaning that it is fully compliant with the INF. It has accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty it wants to leave anyway so as to develop new missiles.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a news briefing on Wednesday that Washington had made it clear through diplomatic channels that its decision to exit the pact was final and that it was not open to dialogue.
Russia displayed the missile system after the briefing anyway and broadcast the event on state television. 
A top military official told the briefing the cruise missile was a modernized version of Russia's 9M728 missile. 
The newer version had a maximum range of 480 kilometers - 10 kilometers less than the 9M728 - which meant it was fully compliant with the INF treaty, Lieutenant-General Mikhail Matveyevsky, head of Russia's Missile Troops and Artillery, said.

The impasse sets the stage for Washington to begin pulling out of the pact on Feb. 2, a move likely to raise questions about the future of other arms control agreements between the two countries.

Talks between the two sides took place in Jordan last week. Both parties need to agree on lists of prisoners to be swapped.
""We expect that in 10 days time the final signing will have happened,"" the head of the government delegation to the prisoner-exchange talks, Hadi Haig, told Reuters by telephone.
The United Nations is pushing for the exchange and a peace deal in Yemen's main port, Hodeidah. That could open the way for more talks between the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government on ending the country's civil war.
The swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at December's U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, held amid Western pressure to end the conflict. The fighting has lasted nearly four years, killed tens of thousands and brought 10 million people to the brink of famine.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that it hopes to see ""progress in the coming days"" and urged the warring parties not to let the opportunity slip away.
""This is a crucial moment for the people of Yemen,"" Red Cross regional director Fabrizio Carboni said in a statement issued at a press conference in the Houthi-held capital, Sana'a. 
The ICRC said it was preparing for the swap by increasing staff numbers and arranging medical support. It was also preparing two planes to carry detainees between Sana'a and Sayoun, a town under the control of the Hadi government.
The conflict pits the Houthis against Yemeni forces backed by a Sunni Muslim coalition, which are trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Hadi was ousted from power in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sana'a.
The conflict began after pro-democracy unrest forced the former president, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh, to step down in 2012. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government, but the Houthis drove him into exile, prompting the coalition to intervene in Yemen in 2015.

The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran and say their revolution is against corruption.

Parliament opened a two-day debate on ratifying the so-called Prespes Agreement, a U.N. mediated deal between Athens and Skopje changing the latter's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The deal, aimed at settling a 28-year old dispute between the two countries over the use of the term ""Macedonia"", has triggered strong opposition among many Greeks, angered at what they see as an attempt by their neighbors to appropriate Greek identity. 
Parliament is expected to ratify the name accord as Leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appears to have secured the support of at least 151 lawmakers in the 300-seat house.
However, the latest opinion poll conducted for Proto Thema newspaper on Jan. 20 showed 66 percent of respondents against the agreement.
Tens of thousands of people rallied against the settlement in Athens on Sunday, arguing that it leaves room for territorial claims over Greece's largest northern province of Macedonia.
""This is a historic deal which solves a national issue which has lasted for 30 years,"" said Sia Anagnostopoulou, a lawmaker from the ruling Syriza party during the opening of the two-day debate expected to culminate in a vote late Thursday at the earliest.
Greek parliamentary endorsement of the accord is needed for the ex-Yugoslav state to eventually join the European Union and NATO, organizations where Greece is a member and has veto rights - like other members - on who gets to join. 
George Koumoutsakos, parliamentary spokesman for opposition New Democracy, criticized the government for settling on a 'nationally damaging' deal and forfeiting its bargaining power. New Democracy has been critical that the deal grants Macedonian ethnicity, and recognizes the existence of a Macedonian language.
""You gave, with your signature, consents and concessions which no government ever did in the past,"" Koumoutsakos said.

Tsipras scraped through a confidence motion in parliament last week following the departure of his right-wing coalition allies Independent Greeks (ANEL) which were against the accord.

DAVOS (Reuters) - As businessmen and bankers sip their morning coffee in a hotel lobby, admiring the Swiss Alps, a disturbing scene is unfolding in the car park below: men with guns are ordering people onto their knees and stealing their watches.
""A Day in the Life of a Refugee"", an hour-long simulation that aims to give people a taste of being an asylum-seeker, has been held for the past 11 years at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. Its organizers say it has never been needed more than now.
With anti-immigration policies gaining major support across Western countries, the aid group that runs the simulation wants politicians, officials and chief executives attending Davos to understand the issue from the frightening perspective of a refugee.
""It's more effective now, the message,"" said Sally Begbie, director of Hong Kong-based Crossroads Foundation. ""We bring it to Davos because there are people making policy here. We want to give them a brief opportunity to step in a refugee's shoes.""
Summit organizers have also included refugees in the main program -- a long-term resident of a Kenyan refugee camp is a co-chair this year. But beyond Davos, refugee groups say doors are closing, especially in Europe.
On Tuesday, the United Nations criticized European nations for not allowing boatloads of migrants to disembark at safe ports and of relying instead on Libya's coastguard to return them to the dangerous North African country.
    Among asylum-seekers who managed to reach Europe before the ports closed, many have found work but others are finding it increasingly difficult. In Italy, the government has made a new law making it harder for asylum-seekers to get work.
In a migrant camp in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, Syrian asylum-seeker Mustafa Othman complains of little to do.
    ""I have done nothing,"" he said, adding that he had failed his first goal on arriving in Europe: ""to help my family, to do something for them"". The 33-year-old left his native Aleppo in 2012 and says he suffers depression, fearing deportation.
A former engineering student who speaks several languages, he helps out at the migrant center and assists aid groups.
Many other migrants, however, have found work and a new life, especially in Germany where official data issued in April 2018 showed a growing number are finding jobs.
One of those is 25-year-old Afghan migrant Quadratullah Hotak who made it to Germany before a huge 2015 migrant influx to Europe that has fueled support for populist parties across the continent and led to an anti-immigration backlash.
Hotak is a trainee at Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in Cologne and says his dream is to get a master craftsman certificate, become a Ford employee and ""start a family and have a good future"".
Since Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to welcome almost one million asylum seekers, there are growing fears that Germany cannot cope with new arrivals.
In the Davos car park, though, a group of aid workers are trying to persuade those who make official policy -- as well as executives who collectively hire hundreds of thousands of people worldwide -- to make the case for continuing to accept refugees.
""I was very moved by it. It will stay with me for ever,"" said an executive from U.S. tech firm Hewlett Packard, one of 26 people who went through the refugee simulation on Tuesday.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>","Japan's Abe to put trade, climate at center of G20 agenda","By Leika Kihara
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday he will seek to use his chairmanship of the Group of 20 leading economies to rebuild trust in the global trade system.
His speech to the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps was significant at a time when a bitter Sino-U.S. trade dispute is one of several factors threatening to bring about a sharp slowdown in global growth.
""Japan is determined to preserve and committed to enhancing the free, open, and rules-based international order,"" he told delegates.
""I call on all of you ... to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade. That should be a system that is fair, transparent, and effective in protecting intellectual property rights and also in such areas as e-commerce and government procurement.""
With the French, British and U.S. leaders cancelling their visits because of more pressing concerns at home, Abe is one of only three Group of Seven leaders attending the annual event in Davos, where business executives are worried about the damage that populism and trade protectionism are inflicting on the global economy.
Abe said Japan, as chair of this year's gathering of the Group of 20 (G20), will also seek to spearhead discussions on climate change and ways to facilitate use of digital data while protecting intellectual property.
The comments underscore Japan's hope to rally support from some of its G20 counterparts in pushing for a multilateral approach in solving trade frictions.
That could help Tokyo fend off pressure from Washington to open up its politically sensitive agriculture market and take other steps to fix bilateral trade imbalances, analysts say.
Japan has to be consistent on the need to promote free trade ""and shouldn't change this stance even if the United States is always talking about doing a bilateral deal,"" said Takeshi Niinami, head of brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd [SUNTH.UL] and an economic adviser to Abe.
Australia, Singapore and other Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries could help Japan make free trade a key topic of debate at the G20, he told Reuters.
At his previous Davos visit in 2014, Abe pledged to pull the economy out of stagnation with his ""Abenomics"" mix of fiscal spending, ultra-easy monetary policy and steps to boost Japan's potential growth via labor market reform and deregulation.
Five years later, the boost to growth from Abenomics is fading, inflation remains far below the Bank of Japan's target and critics point to a lack of progress on deregulation.
Abe sought to counter such criticism, saying that through job-creating policies he had demolished ""a wall of despair and pessimism on Japan"" that had existed five years ago.
He said Japan hoped to build a G20 consensus on the need to reduce plastic waste flowing into the oceans, and coordinate on global usage of digital data without infringing on personal privacy and intellectual property.
""I must say that spending money for a green earth and a blue ocean, once deemed costly, is now a growth generator,"" he said.
""Decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem. We policy makers must be held responsible to make it happen, as I will be stressing in Osaka this year.""
People close to the premier have said Abe is keen to use the G20 summit in Osaka, western Japan, in June to boost his poll ratings ahead of an upper house election looming mid-year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A Japanese patrol aircraft made an ""intimidating"" pass over a South Korean warship on Wednesday, in what South Korea's military said was a ""clear provocation"" toward a friendly neighbor.
The aircraft made its flight just over the South Korean navy vessel in waters off the southwest coast of the Korean peninsula, even after the aircraft determined the ship's identity, the South Korean military said.
""Today's low-altitude flight was a clear provocation against a ship of a friendly country, and we cannot help but doubt Japan's intentions and strongly condemn it,"" General Suh Wook, of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news briefing. 
South Korea's defense ministry said it called in a defense official from Japan's embassy to lodge a protest.
""If this behavior is repeated again, we will sternly respond according to our military's rules of conduct,"" Suh said.
Japanese government and defense force spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, as saying he was aware of the South Korean announcement and it was important the two countries maintained communication.
The two U.S. allies share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.
The rows over wartime history have long been a stumbling block for relations between the neighbors, sparking concern about regional efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear program.
Wednesday's encounter follows a December feud over a Japan complaint that a South Korean destroyer locked a targeting radar on a Japanese surveillance plane. 
South Korea denied it, saying the plane needlessly approached the ship, which was on a normal rescue mission.
There have been two other flights by Japanese aircraft near South Korean vessels since Friday, which prompted a South Korean request to Japan to top such incidents, Suh said.
Defense officials from the two sides have been meeting but Japan had decided to halt the talks, Japanese media reported on Monday. 

The two countries' foreign ministers are due to meet later on Wednesday on the sidelines of an international conference in Davos, Switzerland.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>","Braving dangerous waters, Iranians seek a better life in Britain","By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LIVERPOOL (Reuters) - The traffickers told Fardin Gholami that a fishing boat would take him from France to England at midnight, but when he and five other Iranian asylum seekers got to the beach, all they found was an inflatable dinghy with nobody to sail it.
Gholami had paid 16,000 euros to human traffickers to take him from Kamyaran, in western Iran, to Britain. But on the seashore near Calais he realized he and his compatriots would now have to fend for themselves.
""They showed us a red light on the horizon and said we should sail toward that,"" said Gholami, 31, one of hundreds of Iranians who have risked their lives to cross the English Channel.
The Channel is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, and the migrants' inflatable boats are not equipped to cross it, especially in treacherous winter weather.
""Sometimes there were big ships. It was scary. We knew if we crashed into them, that would be the end of us,"" he said.
Mohammad Salehi Bakhtiari, 47, crossed the Channel in October. ""The waves were coming from all directions. It was a nightmare. We saw death many times in the four hours it took to cross. Those four hours felt like four months,"" he told Reuters. 
More than 500 migrants - mostly Iranians, some of them children - attempted to travel to Britain in rubber dinghies in 2018, four out of five of them in the last three months of the year. Some were turned back to France.
British Home Secretary Sajid Javid cut short a family holiday to address the issue. Britain has doubled the number of patrol boats in the Channel to four, along with a naval ship.
One month after he was arrested near the port of Dover, Gholami lives in a hostel in Liverpool, temporary accommodation provided by the government while his asylum claim is being processed. 
His roommate, Babak Hajipour, 40, also crossed the Channel in December. ""We thought that if we did not succeed we would die and it would be over once and for all,"" he said. 
British media described the Iranian exodus as a final effort to reach Britain before it leaves the European Union. But all the asylum seekers that Reuters spoke to said Brexit was not a factor for them. One had not even heard of it.
Gholami, a teacher, left Iran after his environmental activist friends were arrested and he feared he would be too.
Bakhtiari, an electricity project manager, spent two years in prison for distributing information about labor rights in factories. He fled the country while on temporary release.
Hajipour, a plumber and electrician, left after being beaten by police on the street for wearing shorts. 
""I think sanctions, the economic situation on Iran, and mixing religion with politics are the main reasons why people are leaving the country,"" he said.
He hoped eventually to bring his family to Britain, including his 7-year-old daughter. ""She will not have a bright future in Iran,"" Hajipour said.
DEAD END
Other Iranian asylum seekers in Europe and Turkey told Reuters they decided to leave Iran after giving up hope in the face of growing economic and political difficulties.
Last summer, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement to restrict Tehran's nuclear program, imposing sanctions that caused prices to soar in Iran.
In 2018, more than 21,000 Iranians left the country to seek asylum in Europe, Turkey, the United States, Canada and Australia, United Nations figures show.
Iran's Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Major General Mohammad Baqeri, said: ""Foreign enemies are encouraging young people to leave Iran and turn their backs on the values of the Islamic Revolution, persuading people that resisting superpowers will lead to war.""  
In the third quarter of 2018, the number of Iranian asylum seekers in Britain increased more than 30 percent from the previous year. The Home Office said most asylum applicants last year came from Iran. 
""Here and maybe in other countries, there are more Iranian refugees than Syrians,"" Gholami said.
""The situation in Iran is worse than a country at war. Especially recently, because of the country's nuclear ambitions, the economic situation has deteriorated and I think there will be a new wave of Iranian economic refugees,"" he said. 
A 37-year-old Iranian, who asked not to be named because he feared for the safety of his family in Iran, said he sold his house to come to Britain.
""I never dreamed of coming to Europe. I had a decent life in Iran, a car, a small factory with workers.""
He said he felt humiliated queuing for food in Liverpool, where he receives 35 pounds a week from the British government. But a bus ride in the city costs 2.50 pounds and he has to pay more than 30 pounds for an internet connection on his phone to talk to his family back home.
There, a worker earns only enough in a day to buy half a kilo of meat. ""Because of sanctions, people are at a dead end,"" he said.
AFFLUENT BUT WITHOUT HOPE
Economic hardship might have triggered an exodus from Iran, but Roya Kashefi of the Association of Iranian Researchers believes Iranian refugees should be considered political, not economic migrants.
""Iranian asylum seekers are mostly middle class and educated. Some are affluent enough to pay $16,000 to human traffickers,"" said Kashefi who works with the Home Office on Iranian asylum seekers. 
In Calais, Maya Konforti, secretary of the Association l'Auberge des Migrants, believes Iranian asylum seekers resort to extreme measures like sewing their lips together, hunger strikes, or crossing the Channel in small boats, because of their middle class background.
""They had a decent life, from a financial point of view, in Iran, while living conditions in Calais are horrendous. They were used to living in a house, and here they have to live in a muddy tent in the cold. So they cannot stand it,"" Konforti told Reuters. 
""They tell us staying in Calais is like dying one day at a time. They are ready to try anything. They say OK, boats. We don't care. We take the risk, we might die, but at least we will die quickly."" 
The number of Iranians in and around Calais began growing in late 2017 after Serbia scrapped visa requirements for Iranian citizens, opening up an easier route to the European Union.
Serbia canceled the initiative 14 months later after 1,100 Iranian sought asylum there. Others moved on.
One Tehran resident told Reuters that many young people and families wanted to leave for a better life. 
His first attempt in June to reach Europe via Russia failed after almost a month on the road.
""The human traffickers asked us for more money. We didn't have any, so they took our mobile phones and left us in the middle of the road. We really struggled to return to Iran.""

He is saving money for his next journey to Europe through Turkey.

BAQA AL-GHARBIYYE, Israel (Reuters) - The family of an Israeli student who was killed in Australia made final preparations her funeral on Wednesday as her body arrived back in her home town.
Mourners gathered along the sandstone walls of Aiia Maasarwe’s old school in Baqa Al-Gharbiyye near Haifa in northern Israel. Relatives and neighbors filed into her family’s home to offer condolences.
Near the family's front gate in the close-knit Arab town, relatives and neighbors had hung signs in Arabic saying “Stop picking our flowers”. The family said that was a reference to violence against young women. Municipal offices shut down for the day.
Maasarwe, 21, was killed while walking home after a night out with friends in Melbourne, where she was studying. A student at Shanghai University, she had been on a six-month exchange program at Melbourne’s La Trobe University. 
Her body was found by passersby early on Jan. 16 near the university's Bundoora campus in the northeast of Australia’s second-largest city. 
Her death has fueled outrage in Australia, where thousands marched over the weekend calling for safety for women.
It was the second time in seven months that a young woman had been killed on her way home at night in Melbourne, which has an active night life and is popular with overseas university students.
A family member said Maasarwe was talking on the phone to her sister back home in Israel when she was attacked, and that she often made such calls to make her feel safer while walking home late at night. 
Her uncle, Abed Katane, said she had chosen the university “because she’d never heard any problems about Melbourne” or other Australian cities.
“She had to decide between New York and Melbourne, and called me to ask what I think,” he said.
“We both felt that Australia is more quiet, and its people more well-behaved. Our opinion turned out for the worse.”
Maasarwe’s death has shocked Baqa al-Gharbiyye, a densely populated community which lies next to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Its 30,000 residents are members of Israel's Arab minority.

A 20-year-old man who has been charged with murder was remanded in custody on Monday. The case was adjourned until June, according to a spokeswoman for the Melbourne Magistrate Court.

Relations between Italy and France, generally close allies, have worsened since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition government in Italy last year and took aim at pro-European Union Macron's En Marche (On the Move) party.
""Macron may no longer be our interlocutor (in the future),"" Salvini said in an interview with state-owned radio RAI. ""His support is less than 20 percent. I hope the French people can shortly make different choices,"" he said, referring to the May European elections. 
On Monday, France summoned Italy's ambassador after Salvini's fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa and generating mass migration to Europe.
On Tuesday, Salvini said France was not interested in stabilizing war-torn Libya, a staging point for smugglers who send migrants toward Europe on unsafe boats, because French energy interests there clash with Italy's.
Salvini, who is the leader of the League party, also said he is not concerned about the effect the dispute will have on the government's effort to save troubled airline Alitalia.
Italian newspapers have reported that the French-Dutch airline Air France-KLM is in talks with Rome to take a stake in the carrier.
""There are other (players) in a position to take a share of Alitalia's capital,"" Salvini said.

BEIJING/SHENZHEN (Reuters) - About a dozen Chinese labor activists and university students have either gone missing or been detained by police this week, sources told Reuters, amid a deepening crackdown on activists seeking improved rights for factory workers.
A loose but active coalition of workers, activists and students across China has since July 2018 faced off against police, with dozens detained over their support for workers who protested after being blocked from forming a labor union with leaders of their choice.
The clampdown has spread to top universities, with some students being detained and, they say, threatened by police.
Three students and two recent graduates of Peking University, known informally as Beida, and a student from Renmin University have been missing for more than 24 hours, according to a post from a solidarity group, released online late on Tuesday. 
A spokeswoman for Beida declined to comment.
In the southern province of Guangdong, two labor activists went missing and three were detained on suspicion of ""disrupting public order"" or ""picking quarrels"", according to Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labor rights group.
It was unclear if the two sets of detentions were related. The Public Security Ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
The students, all members of a group that has been calling for the release of those detained, had been hiding out after releasing statements on Monday decrying police use of ""confession"" videos from some of those detained, according to a source who had been in contact with the students.
Friends of those featured in the videos told Reuters that the versions of events given by the activists were radically different from how they recalled the incidents, and called some of the claims an attempt to ""invert black and white"".
Police have previously detained some students for a few hours before releasing them, but some of those who have been picked up have not been released, the source added, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
A Beida student Zhan Zhenzhen, for example, has been missing since early January, after the school said he had been expelled for taking part in ""unapproved"" events, the source said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is investigating the whereabouts of a Chinese-Australian man, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said on Wednesday, after a newspaper report raised fears that the dissident former diplomat has been detained in China. 
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday that friends feared Yang Hengjun, an author and former Chinese diplomat who is now an Australian citizen, had been detained because he had not been reachable for several days.
His disappearance comes at a time of high tension between China and some parts of the West after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Those arrests were widely seen in the West as retaliation by Beijing for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei Technologies executive, in Canada on Dec. 1. She is accused of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Two friends contacted by Reuters said they had reported Yang as missing to DFAT. They said he had been missing since he flew from New York to Guangzhou in southern China on Friday.
One of those friends, Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, said Yang had been scheduled to fly on to Shanghai but never arrived. 
""I believe he is in custody of the Ministry of State Security in Beijing,"" Feng said.
China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked about Yang's disappearance, told a regular briefing that she had ""no understanding"" of the situation.
China's Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
A DFAT spokeswoman confirmed the department was investigating but did not identify Yang by name.
""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is seeking information about an Australian citizen who has been reported missing in China,"" the spokeswoman said.
A source familiar with the investigation said Australia made contact with Chinese officials overnight to ask about Yang's whereabouts.
Australia joined international condemnation of the arrest of the two Canadians but Yang has long been in the sights of Chinese authorities. He has criticized what he described as Chinese interference in Australia.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent since coming to power in 2012, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained. Dozens have been jailed.

Phan Van Binh, 47, was accused by the court of working for a California-based group called the Provisional National Government of Vietnam, which opposes the ruling Communist Party, the ministry said in a statement on its official news website.
""Binh's activities were serious violations of the law which undermined national unity, infringed upon national security, and went against the national interest,"" the ministry said, citing state prosecutors present at the one-day trial in the central province of Khanh Hoa.
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
Binh uploaded posts to his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account that ""smeared the image of Ho Chi Minh, and the leaders of the party and the state"", the ministry said in its statement, referring to the Vietnamese revolutionary leader and founding president.
Binh's Facebook posts ""distorted the Party's history and guidance, and the state's policies and laws, with the aim of overthrowing the people's administration,"" the ministry said.
A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Reuters was unable to identify and contact Binh's lawyers.
Telephone calls to the court went unanswered.
The Provisional National Government of Vietnam, which is listed by the Ministry of Public Security as a ""terrorist organization"", did not respond to a request for comment.
The organization's leader, Dao Minh Quan, assigned Binh to recruit people into joining the group by using his telephone to show videos created by the organization to his neighbors, the ministry said.
Facebook is widely used in Vietnam and serves as the main platform for dissidents. This month, Vietnam accused Facebook of violating a new cybersecurity law by allowing users to post anti-government comments.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean activist pastor Evan Mawarire will ask the High Court on Wednesday to free him on bail after his detention on subversion charges following violent protests over a fuel price hike that sparked a brutal security crackdown.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa promised action on Tuesday in response to a widely condemned clampdown on civilians in which at least three people were killed and scores wounded during unrest ignited by his decision to raise the price of fuel by 150 percent. https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hq1WRf
Zimbabwe's Human Rights Commission accused security forces of systematic torture, offering the starkest indications yet that the country was reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterized Robert Mugabe's 37 years in power. Mugabe was forced from office after a coup in November 2017.
Residents in two Harare townships and a neighborhood in the second city, Bulawayo, said patrolling soldiers beat up residents on Tuesday night, continuing a trend seen since the protests started. Armed soldiers are providing security for a subsidized state bus service.
Mawarire, who rose to prominence as a critic of Mugabe and led a national protest shutdown in 2016, is charged with subverting the government and inciting public violence. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
He was tried on similar charges in 2017 but was acquitted for lack of evidence.
His lawyer, Tonderai Bhatasara, said a judge was due to hear the case at the High Court from 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Wednesday. Mawarire was not expected to attend the hearing.
A lawyers' group expressed concern that the courts were denying bail to anyone charged with public violence and, in some cases, were fast-tracking trials, threatening the right to fair hearings.
As the court prepared to hear Mawarire's case, Mnangagwa was due to swear in Kumbirai Hodzi as prosecutor general, government officials said.
Hodzi raised eyebrows when he told the interviewing panel that he took instructions from the executive when deciding who to prosecute, leading to opposition accusations that the prosecutor general's office was not independent.
Last week's protests and security crackdown brought into focus Zimbabwe's political and economic crisis, exposing deep-seated anger over the direction of the economy.

Mnangagwa promised during campaigning for the July 2018 presidential vote to repair the economy and break with Mugabe's politics. However, critics say Zimbabwe has fallen back into a familiar pattern.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea failed to notify a U.N. sanctions committee when it sent about 300 tonnes of petroleum products to North Korea in 2018, the website NK News reported on Wednesday, suggesting South Korea was slipping on sanctions.
South Korea has urged the partial easing of U.N. Security Council sanctions at a time of improving ties with the North, as the United States continues to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 
""Seoul has chosen to implement UNSC sanctions on North Korea on a selective and often inconsistent basis,"" NK News, a group that follows North Korea, said in a report on its website, citing its analysis.
South Korea sent 342.9 tonnes of petroleum products to North Korea in 2018, according to the South's Ministry of Unification, but NK News said the shipments were not reported to the United Nations.
South Korea's government said on Wednesday it was ""complying with the framework of sanctions on North Korea"" while pursuing exchange and cooperative projects with the North.
""We only used petroleum products to carry out joint inter-Korean projects, and our view is that this does not harm the purpose of sanctions on North Korea,"" the foreign ministry said. 
The U.N. Security Council said the monthly reports of petroleum shipments to North Korea showed that only China and Russia had submitted the required reports in 2018.
Under UNSC resolution 2397, adopted in 2017, member states must notify a sanctions committee every 30 days of the amount of refined petroleum products supplied, sold or transferred to North Korea.
The U.N. sanction allows up to 500,000 barrels (73,087 tonnes) of refined petroleum products per year from all U.N. member nations to be supplied, sold or transferred to the North.
Most of the petroleum products shipped to the North in 2018 were used for North-South family reunions in August, and joint projects such as a railway survey and the remodeling of a liaison office in Kaesong in the North.
About 32.3 tonnes were returned to the South, the Unification Ministry said. 

South Korea said in November it had received sanctions exemptions from the UNSC for a joint railway survey, the first step toward reconnecting rail and road links cut during the 1950-53 Korean War.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Wednesday presented a controversial bill to lawmakers that prescribes jail terms of up to three years for disrespecting the Chinese national anthem, a move critics say raises fresh fears over freedom of expression in the city.
Chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism in the former British colony at a time of heightened tension between democracy activists and forces loyal to Beijing, with some in Hong Kong even advocating independence from China.
Besides imprisonment, the measure would fix a maximum fine of HK$50,000 ($6,370) for those who publicly and intentionally disrespect the anthem, the ""March of the Volunteers"".
It also extends to schoolchildren, including pupils of international schools, who would be legally required to learn the anthem. 
""I think teachers would feel worried about this proposal, because if we allow this government to pass a law to instruct the teachers what to teach, well, this time it is for the national anthem, maybe next time it could be other things,"" said secondary school teacher Simon Hung, 36. 
Small groups of pro-democracy and pro-Beijing protesters taunted each other outside the Legislative Council, shouting and chanting through loud hailers.
Waving the red Chinese flag, pro-Beijing demonstrators held up banners that read: ""Safeguard national dignity"" and ""Support the national anthem law,"" while democracy activists held placards that said: ""Unsung freedom."" 
Booing the anthem at soccer matches in Hong Kong has emerged as a form of political protest in the past few years, seized upon by young people keen to demonstrate their frustration at Beijing's perceived creeping influence.
The global financial hub returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of expression.
The anthem proposal is expected to pass easily when it comes to a vote - probably before the summer - as the opposition does not have enough seats to block routine legislation. 
Hong Kong has already outlawed the desecration of national flags and emblems, which can attract jail terms of three years. 
Calls for outright independence are a red line for China's Communist Party leaders, who deem Hong Kong an inalienable part of the nation.
But many young people in Hong Kong have become increasingly angered by what they see as China's encroachment on the city's culture and autonomy, with some advocating ""localism"", or a Hong Kong identity, rather than a Chinese one.
""We have no sense of belonging to China at all,"" one football supporter told Reuters. ""Even people I know who are born since 1997, they still think they are HongKongers, but not Chinese."" 

In 2017, mainland China adopted a law banning disrespect for the anthem. A similar measure is being reviewed in Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to Chinese rule in 1999.

Authorities in the nation of 260 million are battling a lack of recycling culture or environmental awareness to achieve an ambitious target of a 70 percent cut in marine plastic debris by 2025, despite having devoted $1 billion a year to the task. 
""Every time it rains and floods, the whole village goes down to help with the trash and clean the river,"" said Marzuki, a resident of Tarumajaya, on the banks of the Pisang Batu river that carries along waste from villages upstream.
""We never get tired of it, but the trash never stops coming.""
Yet the river is just one of many thickly carpeted with trash formed mostly of plastic waste, of which Indonesia churns out about 3.2 million tonnes each year, with nearly half ending up in the sea, a 2015 study in the journal Science showed.
The archipelago of more than 17,000 islands is estimated to be the world's second-largest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans after China, the study added.  
""Even though we've brought an armada of 25 garbage trucks that take three turns every day, the reality is...we haven't cleared even half of it,"" said Suseno, the village security chief in Tarumajaya.
As Java struggles with its rivers, the resort island of Bali this year banned the use of plastic bags by large supermarkets and grocery stores, a measure it aims to widen to smaller shops.
Yet that caused its own backlash.
""I've seen people protest because they didn't get plastic bags after they shop,"" said one supermarket shopper, Thomas Wibowo, while adding that he understood the need to cut back. 
""But if we are suddenly forbidden from using plastic, as Indonesians, we'd be shocked.""
The risks to marine life were graphically highlighted last November, when a dead sperm whale on a beach was found to have 6 kg (13lb) of plastic waste in its stomach.
""I think this is also a global issue, not just a national problem,"" said Ida Bagus Rai Dharmawijaya Mantra, the mayor of Bali's capital of Denpasar.

""I've seen that a lot of citizens are accepting and helping of this movement, including tourists. They too want to help replace plastic bags.""

The incident on Saturday saw counter-terrorism officials open fire on a car they said was being used by an Islamic State leader in the province, Zeeshan Javed. He was killed along with three passengers - grocery store owner Mohammad Khalil, his wife and their 12 year-old daughter.
However, the official account of the incident was disputed by witnesses, including Khalil's three other children, who survived the attack and discredited by video footage widely circulated on social media.
The latest in a long series of episodes of alleged police brutality sparked protests in Lahore and drew condemnation from politicians including Prime Minister Imran Khan, who promised a clean up of the Punjab police.
Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat said the provincial government had removed the head of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and three other officials who will all face disciplinary action.
""Initial report of the Joint Investigation Team for the Sahiwal encounter reveals that the CTD officials were responsible for killing Khalil and his family, who were innocent,"" Basharat said.

The five officers who shot at the car in Sahiwal town will be charged with murder and tried in an anti-terrorism court, he told reporters.

The United States has accused Meng Wanzhou of misrepresenting the company's links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The arrest soured ties between Canada and China, which subsequently detained two Canadians and sentenced a third to death. 
The U.S. statement came a day after a report that Canada's ambassador to the United States said his government was told Washington planned to proceed. 
""We will continue to pursue the extradition of defendant Ms. Meng Wanzhou, and will meet all deadlines set by the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty,"" Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in a statement.
""We greatly appreciate Canada's continuing support of our mutual efforts to enforce the rule of law.""
Huawei Chairman Liang Hua told media at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday that the company was following the issue closely and wanted a quick resolution of the case, but had no direct contact with authorities.
The United States must file a formal request for extradition by Jan. 30. Once it is received, a Canadian court has 30 days to determine if there is enough supporting evidence and the Canadian justice minister must issue a formal order. 
Canada has not asked the United States to drop its bid to have Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou extradited, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told Bloomberg TV in an interview.
""CONTAINING"" HUAWEI
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces U.S.-led allegations that its devices present a national security risk. Huawei says such concerns are unfounded.
In an editorial on Wednesday, the state-run China Daily newspaper said Canada was helping the United States try to limit China's technological advance by ""containing"" Huawei.
""If Canada does continue to do what is required of it by the U.S., it will certainly see its relations with China, including its trade relations, further deteriorate,"" the newspaper warned.
Canada had the choice not to carry out the extradition of Meng on what were trumped-up charges, it added. 
It said there was no connection between Meng's arrest and China's detention of two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security.
China would ""respond"" to U.S. actions, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday, when asked whether China would retaliate against the United States if Meng was extradited. But she did not elaborate. 
In an article on Monday, a former head of Canada's spy agency said the country should ban Huawei from supplying equipment to its 5G networks. China's ambassador has threatened repercussions if Ottawa blocks Huawei.
""We've talked about it with Germany because we have a good relationship with Germany and our European partners generally, and Germany is having some deliberations of its own too,"" Freeland said on Tuesday, regarding possible curbs on Huawei's access to 5G networks. 
The German government is debating whether to follow the United States and allies like Australia in restricting Huawei from accessing its next-generation mobile networks, business daily Handelsblatt said.

Huawei will allow foreign officials to visit its labs, Liang said on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Reports of drone sightings in northern New Jersey temporarily halted arrivals at Newark Liberty International Airport on Tuesday, but normal operations had since been resumed, officials said.
A spokesman from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier said flights into Newark - the 11th busiest U.S. airport - were briefly suspended after two drones were seen flying at 3,500 feet over nearby Teterboro Airport, a small regional airport about 17 miles away that mostly handles corporate jets and private planes.
The federal agency said information about the drone sightings was turned over to law enforcement. 
The FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center briefly issued a ground stop at Newark citing ""drone activity,"" according to a document posted on its website.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates both the Newark and Teterboro airports, later said on Twitter that normal operations had resumed and that it was coordinating with the FAA and law enforcement authorities as they investigate the incident.
United Airlines, the largest carrier at Newark, said it was aware of the reports of drone activity and was working with the airport and the FAA. It said the impact on its operations had been minimal.
The issue of drones impacting commercial air traffic has taken on new urgency after reports of drone sightings in the United Kingdom impacted air travel.
Earlier this month, flights from London’s Heathrow airport were halted for about an hour after a drone was sighted near Europe’s busiest air hub.
Gatwick Airport, London’s second busiest airport, was severely disrupted in December when drones were sighted on three consecutive days, resulting in about 1,000 flights being canceled or diverted and affecting 140,000 passengers.
Both airports responded to the Gatwick incident by ordering military-grade anti-drone technology.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed rules that would allow drones to operate over populated areas and end a requirement for special permits for night use, long-awaited actions that are expected to help speed commercial use.
The Trump administration noted there are nearly 1.3 million registered drones in the United States and more than 116,000 registered drone operators. But officials say there are hundreds of thousands of additional drones that are not registered.
The U.S. Congress last year gave the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security new powers to disable or destroy threatening drones after officials raised concerns about the use of drones as potential weapons.
In September 2017, a small civilian drone struck a U.S. Army UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York. The helicopter landed safely but there was some damage.

The Saturday night killing in the northern city of Ibarra and the ensuing attacks on Venezuelans marked an escalation in migration-related tensions in Ecuador, which like other South American countries has received thousands of the nearly 3 million Venezuelans who have fled economic collapse since 2015.
""Many of the Venezuelans in Ibarra want to go back,"" said Pedro Sassone, the charge d'affaires at Venezuela's embassy in Ecuador, who said five commercial flights were planned this week to take migrants back. ""Venezuelans in Ibarra are being fired from their jobs - that is xenophobia, that is discrimination.""
Socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government has for months been promoting a 'Return to the Fatherland' program to bring migrants from around the region back to Venezuela. Venezuelan officials have also argued that emigration statistics are exaggerated to justify intervention by foreign powers.
Sassone said he expected 400 Venezuelan migrants to return from Ecuador, including 40 from Ibarra. A total of 250,000 Venezuelans live in Ecuador, of whom 42 percent have valid work visas, government statistics show.
In response to the murder, Ecuador announced it would begin demanding that Venezuelans seeking entry should present their criminal records at the border, while President Lenin Moreno said he would create ""units"" to check Venezuelans' legal status ""in the streets, in the workplace, and at the border.""
Representatives of the Andean country's Venezuelan community said migrants had suffered attacks and threats in the wake of the incident and Moreno's comments. Ecuadorean officials have called on their citizens not to make generalizations about migrants and to refrain from acts of violence.
""This past week has been worse than ever - they look at you badly on the street, you are scared to go outside,"" said Angelys Lopez, 17, who has worked as a street vendor in Quito for three years but is now hoping for a spot on a plane back to Caracas.
""I am scared to stay in Ecuador - that is why I am returning to my country.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former top lieutenant to accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman on Tuesday said he and his former boss once discussed killing a police officer as a favor to a local politician.
Damaso Lopez Nunez, testifying against Guzman in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, walked jurors through a BlackBerry message exchange in September 2013 in which he said he told Guzman that the mayor of La Paz, a city in the state of Baja California Sur, wanted them to ""remove"" a ""cop that has been bothering her.""
Guzman, Nunez said, responded that they should do the mayor the ""favor,"" because she was a favorite for a state-level office in an upcoming election. He said they should make the hit look like ""revenge from some gangbanger.""
Lopez did not say whether the murder took place. 
The mayor of La Paz in 2013 was Esthela Ponce Beltran, who could not immediately be reached for comment.
Guzman, 61, who was extradited to the United States in 2017, has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world's largest drug trafficking organizations. 
His lawyers have argued that he has been framed by the cartel's real leader, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada.
Lopez, 52, was arrested in Mexico City on U.S. drug charges in 2017 and extradited to the United States in July, where he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. He said Tuesday he is hoping to have his sentence reduced by cooperating with prosecutors.
At the time of Lopez's arrest in May 2017, Mexican officials said he was believed to have been seeking an alliance with Guzman's rival, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
Lopez spent much of his time on the stand corroborating testimony from the dozen or so other cartel members who have appeared at the trial, now in its third month.
Lopez said he began working for Guzman around 2001, helping to arrange drug shipments and bribe government officials, and eventually becoming godfather to one of Guzman's twin daughters.
Lopez is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.
After jurors had left for the day, one of the prosecutors, Gina Parlovecchio, told U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan the prosecution expected to wrap up its case either Thursday afternoon or Monday morning.

After that, Guzman's lawyers will have a chance to call their own witnesses. It is not yet known whether Guzman will testify himself.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The son of Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday he was the target of a ""defamatory campaign"" after news reports that he employed the mother and wife of a fugitive former policeman accused of running a criminal organization.
Flavio Bolsonaro, 37, a former Rio state lawmaker elected to the Senate in October, has already faced tough questions about a series of financial transactions involving him and his former driver and state assembly aide Fabricio Queiroz.
The cases have clouded the first three weeks in office of the new president, a far-right former army captain who surged to victory on a promise to end years of political graft, vowing zero tolerance on those close to him found to be corrupt.
Those promises have added to scrutiny of his son's former staff, which included the relatives of fugitive former police officer Adriano Magalhaes da Nobrega - hirings first reported by newspaper O Globo and confirmed by the senator-elect's aides.
The official gazette of Rio state shows both relatives were on the public payroll as members of Flavio Bolsonaro's staff until November. Efforts to reach them and the fugitive officer were not immediately successful.
The senator-elect issued a statement saying the hiring had been ""at the indication of former aide Fabricio Queiroz.""
""I cannot be held responsible for acts that I'm unaware of,"" added the younger Bolsonaro.
Nobrega, alias ""Captain Adriano,"" is being sought by police for heading a militia that is suspected of being behind the assassination last year of Rio councilwoman Marielle Franco and her driver, whose murders remain unresolved.
A lawyer for Queiroz denied his client had any connection with the militia.
Flavio Bolsonaro has already been under pressure regarding unusual transactions flagged by a government agency, involving large cash movements by Queiroz and deposits in the lawmaker's account, all for the same sum of 2,000 reais and made in quick succession between June 9 and July 13, 2017.
Flavio Bolsonaro said in a television interview they were part payment for an apartment he sold, but he did not clarify why the deposit had not been made in such a way as to hide the origin.
While he is not being investigated for his aide's account movements, neither Bolsonaro nor Queiroz showed up to answer questions when called on to help prosecutors in the probe.
President Bolsonaro's political allies are worried his son's troubles will hurt the three-week-old government and could undermine support for his legislative agenda.

Vice President Hamilton Mourao, a retired general, tried to distance the government from the case, telling Reuters on Sunday that the son's case ""has nothing to do with our government.""

""Our role in Cuba is to advance in the negotiations, we are not aware of the actions taking place in Colombia nor do we have any involvement in them,"" chief ELN negotiator Pablo Beltran told Cuban state-run agency Prensa Latina on Monday.
The ELN had earlier in the day claimed responsibility for last week's car bomb attack against a police academy that killed 21 people as a legitimate act of war and urged President Ivan Duque to return to the negotiating table. 
Duque has called for Cuba, which hosted negotiations with the ELN as it had done previously with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, to extradite the commanders in Havana, who include top ELN leader Nicolas Rodriguez.
The ELN commanders in Havana on Monday demanded that Cuba guarantee them safe passage back to Colombia if the talks end. 
While Cuba condemned the attack, it said it would respect the protocols of the negotiations and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks.
The protocols provide security guarantees for guerrilla commanders to return to Colombia and prevent military attacks for an agreed period.
""They should carry out the terms agreed on rather than asking the impossible of Cuba,"" Beltran said.
Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a tweet over the weekend that the country would never allow its territory to be used for the planning of terrorist acts.
Beltran accused Duque's government of delaying the talks for six months to weaken the ELN with a military offensive.

""Facing such a reality, there have been responses like that of last Thursday, but...we must continue to attempt together to end the conflict,"" Beltran said, adding that the negotiators would hand over all the agreements accorded so far as a departure point for future talks.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese police fired tear gas on Tuesday at hundreds of protesters blocking roads, burning tires and chanting anti-government slogans in and around the capital Khartoum as month-long protests continued unabated.
Demonstrators have been on the streets near-daily since Dec. 19, initially to protest against an economic crisis then to call for an end to the 30-year rule of President Omar al-Bashir.
In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, smoke could be seen rising from burned tires and tree branches, with the sound of the main rallying cry for Bashir's fall: ""Down, that's it"".
In the north of the capital, protesters blocking a main road in one of the most populous neighborhoods chanted: ""How much does a martyr's blood cost?"", witnesses said.
Police fired tear gas to try and disperse crowds in both places, chasing protesters into side-streets, witnesses said.
""We will continue to protest so we can fulfill the goals of those who died, the martyrs,"" said a 36-year-old housewife who asked not to be named.
The official death toll from the month of unrest stands at 26, including two security personnel. 
Rights groups say at least 40 have died.
Earlier on Tuesday, police also fired tear gas at dozens of protesters gathered in Omdurman near the home of a man whose family said had died of wounds on Monday after he was shot at an anti-government protest last week.

Bashir, who has blamed the unrest on foreign ""agents"" and rebels from the western region of Darfur, was traveling to Qatar on Tuesday.

Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez provided no evidence for the government's allegation.
Some two dozen officers attacked a National Guard outpost in the Caracas neighborhood of Cotiza, a km (0.6 mile) from the presidential Miraflores palace, leading to opposition demonstrations in nearby parts of Caracas.
Popular Will called the allegation the ""same lies and manipulation"" and said the party's struggle to re-establish constitutional order was peaceful. In a statement on Twitter, Popular Will accused Rodriguez of trying to mask discontent within the military by accusing the party of stealing the arms.
Government officials often describe Popular Will as a terrorist organization, which the party dismisses as an intimidation tactic.
""Some of those who stole the weapons yesterday confessed that they were handed over to civilians belonging to the terrorist cell Popular Will,"" Rodriguez said in televised statements.
Rodriguez said the officers involved stole 51 rifles but that authorities had only recovered 40. The officers were arrested after the incident. 
Rodriguez alleged Popular Will activists planned to use the weapons to create violence during nationwide marches planned by both the government and the opposition for Wednesday. Popular Will said it neither had nor wanted the weapons.
Congress has called on citizens to take to the streets to protest against President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday, the 61st anniversary of the collapse of a military dictatorship. 
The marches are held every year, but the opposition is unusually energized following Maduro's Jan. 10 inauguration to a disputed second term that governments around the world have decried as illegitimate.

Popular Will lawmaker and congress chief Juan Guaido, who was briefly detained by intelligence agents this month, has received international support amid growing criticism of Maduro. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence released a video on Tuesday in which he expressed support for Venezuela's opposition and Guaido.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The lawyer for a former U.S. marine accused of spying by Russia said on Tuesday that his client had been misled before his arrest and believed that a thumb drive handed to him in a hotel room had contained holiday snaps rather than secret information.
Russia's Federal Security Service detained Paul Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28.
Whelan appeared in a Moscow court on Tuesday, where a judge rejected releasing him on bail. If found guilty of espionage, he could be imprisoned for up to 20 years. 
Whelan, who denies the charges, was detained after receiving a thumb drive containing a list of all the employees of a secret Russian state agency, the Russian online news portal Rosbalt.ru reported this month.
Rosbalt cited a Russian intelligence source it did not identify as saying that Whelan had been spying for 10 years, using the internet to identify targets from whom he could obtain information, and that the list he was caught with had long been of interest to U.S. spies. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov appeared to support that version of events, later telling reporters Whelan had been ""caught red-handed"" carrying out ""specific illegal actions"" in his hotel room.
But Vladimir Zherebenkov, Whelan's lawyer, said on Tuesday that his client had accepted the information unknowingly. 
""Paul was actually meant to receive information from an individual that was not classified,"" Zherebenkov told reporters.
""These were cultural things, a trip to a cathedral, Paul's holiday ... photographs. But as it turned out, it (the thumb drive) contained classified information.""
The lawyer said Whelan had not been able to see what was on the thumb drive because he had been detained before he had a chance to do so.
His twin brother David Whelan, who lives in Canada, in a statement said his family was disappointed Paul had been denied bail. The family have said he was in Moscow to attend a wedding.
""We are certain that he was entrapped and is not guilty of espionage,"" David Whelan's statement said. 
Wearing a blue shirt and dark trousers, he looked calm but somber as he stood inside a glass cage in the courtroom.
The hearing was closed to reporters, but his lawyer said afterwards that Whelan had made a 15-minute speech rejecting the allegations against him in detail.
The lawyer declined to clarify if Whelan had known the person who handed him the information. 

He said Whelan had been experiencing some minor health problems in custody and was receiving treatment.

LAGOS (Reuters) - As many as 20,000 women and girls are feared to have been trafficked from Nigeria to Mali where they are stranded after being forced into prostitution, the head of Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency said on Tuesday. 
Julie Okah-Donli, director general of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), said a fact-finding team from NAPTIP and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had uncovered the extent of the trafficking during a visit to southern Mali last month.
Dozens of women and girls were repatriated from the Kangaba area of southern Mali in the preceding months. The team, which went to the area to investigate, found hundreds more being held there, Okah-Donli said in a telephone interview.
""They were reliably informed by the locals that they had over 200 such places scattered around the southern part of Mali. In each of the shacks where they held them they had 100 to 150 girls in the area. That is how we came to the figure"" of at least 20,000 being held, she said.
The women and girls, most aged 16-30, had been told they would be taken to Malaysia to work in hospitality but instead were forced into prostitution. 
""They are held in horrible, slave-like conditions,"" said Okah-Donli. ""They can't escape because they are kept in remote locations, like deep in forests.""
Thousands of women and girls are taken out of Africa's most populous country each year, where 70 percent of the 190 million inhabitants live on less than two dollars a day. A large proportion of them arrive in Europe but others are transported to other parts of west Africa.
Okah-Donli said her agency had partnered with IOM, which arranged the repatriation of 41 women and girls from Mali in December and was working on returning others home. 
They come mostly from states in southern Nigeria, including Delta, Rivers, Bayelsa, Anambra and Edo.
Others are also thought to be trafficked to other west African countries including Ghana, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, said Okah-Donli.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish prosecutors have tabled another sex crime charge against four men calling themselves ""The Wolf Pack"" who assaulted a young woman at the Pamplona bull-running festival in 2016. 
In a controversial ruling, a Spanish court last year gave nine-year prison sentences to the men for sexually assaulting the 18-year-old in a doorway, but cleared them of rape because of a lack of physical violence.
The case gained notoriety amid the global #MeToo movement and brought calls for changes to Spain's rape law.
In the new case, the Andalusia regional prosecutor's office said it was seeking a seven-year prison sentence for sexual assault and other crimes suspected to have been committed in Pozoblanco, in southern Spain, two months earlier.
Evidence for that was found against four of the five men in total being investigated over the case at the San Fermin festival in the northern city of Pamplona.
Investigators found a video on the cellphone of one of the accused, in which a woman appeared unconscious while men were abusing her inside a car after a night of partying. 
The woman was notified about the video and the new case opened, the prosecutor's office said.
Despite the original ruling against them, the men were released on bail in June last year on a legal technicality that says no one can be held for more than two years without a definitive sentence.
A rape charge in Spain requires a plaintiff to present evidence of specific violence such as being threatened with a knife or dealt physical blows. The government has said it plans to change the penal code to make rape convictions easier.

The annual bull-running festival in the Navarran capital Pamplona is famed for its drunken revelry. But concern has grown over increased reports of sex attacks and harassment at the event as well mistreatment of women in general in Spain.

An Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also canceled a Qatari donation of $15 million for the impoverished enclave that had been due on Wednesday as part of international efforts to head off escalation. 
The Gaza border has simmered since Palestinians launched weekly demonstrations last March to press for the lifting of an Israeli-led blockade on the impoverished territory and rights to family lands lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation. 
Palestinian medics in Gaza said a Hamas militant died and two others were wounded in the Israeli shelling of a lookout post near the fortified frontier in the central sector of the enclave ruled by the Islamist group. 
Hamas confirmed the three casualties as its members. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, one of its officers was shot at as he faced Palestinian rock-throwers at the fence. The bullet struck his helmet, lightly injuring him, the army said, adding that during the incident two Palestinians also crossed into Israel before returning to Gaza. 
Gaza's health ministry says more than 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in 10 months of protests. Israel says it troops resort to lethal force to prevent border breaches by Hamas, against which it has fought three wars since 2008. 
Worried about a potential flare-up into full conflict, Egypt and the United Nations have sought to calm Gaza, while Qatar in November pledged $150 million in donations, to be transferred via Israel over six months, in hope of easing economic pressure. 

A third Qatari payout of $15 million was due on Wednesday, after it was previously held up by Israel in protest at border violence. An Israeli official, announcing the new postponement, did not say when the payout might now take place.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>",Ukraine opposition leader Tymoshenko launches presidential bid as polarizing frontrunner,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko launched her bid for the presidency on Tuesday as the early frontrunner in opinion polls, pledging to fight corruption, increase wages and speed up integration with the West.
A fiery orator, she immediately emerges as a favorite in the March 31 vote to unseat President Petro Poroshenko, who swept to power in the wake of a 2014 revolution but whose popularity has eroded over his failure to stamp out corruption.
""A great country is my goal, from which I will not back down a single step. That is why I am running for president today,"" Tymoshenko told party supporters at sports hall in Kiev, to cheers of ""Yulia is our president"".
A former prime minister with a following among Ukrainian nationalists, Tymoshenko was jailed under pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovich, who defeated her to become president in 2010 and was toppled four years later in a popular revolt.
Released from jail, she again lost the presidency to Poroshenko, a confectionary billionaire who argued that Tymoshenko carried too much baggage to lead the nation.
While she retains a strong core of supporters, she may struggle to win over a majority in a country where many voters consider her a polarizing figure.
An opinion poll late last month by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Kiev-based Razumkov think-tank put Tymoshenko in the lead, with support among likely voters of 16 percent. Poroshenko came second with 13.8 percent.
Tymoshenko said her foreign policy priorities will be Ukraine’s integration into the EU and NATO, which will help the country resist Russian aggression: ""We must become a member of NATO right away. We don’t have time to hesitate,"" she said.
After Yanukovich was toppled, Moscow swiftly annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and supported a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. That conflict, still unresolved, has killed more than 10,000 people. Major fighting ended with a ceasefire in 2015 but deadly clashes still occur regularly. 
Tymoshenko said her team would increase worldwide diplomatic pressure on Russia to stop Moscow's support of the separatists.
She has made economic promises which her critics say are incompatible with Ukraine's obligations under a lending agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
She promised to increase salaries and pensions 3.5-fold during her five-year presidency and said she would change central bank policy to provide cheap loans to small businesses and mortgages to workers.
Poroshenko had proven he lacks the political will to fight corruption, betraying the principles that brought Ukrainians to the streets during the 2013-2014 revolution, she said. 

""Stopping corruption will not be a problem. We will do it. This is possible. You and I have the political will. I promise to become a nightmare for these guys who feed on corruption.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Any deal to end a territorial row with Japan needs public backing, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, giving a nod to widespread Russian opposition to ceding territory to Japan.
Shortly before Putin met Abe in the Kremlin for the latest round of talks on the dispute over a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean, Russian police detained 11 people protesting against territorial concessions outside the Japanese embassy in Moscow
The islands -- known in Russia as the Kuriles and in Japan as the Northern Territories -- were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two. Since then, Tokyo has been seeking their return. 
Russia and Japan have still not formally ended World War Two hostilities because of the dispute.
In prepared remarks to reporters after their talks, Putin and Abe both spoke of their resolve to try to find a solution to the dispute, but they offered few specifics on whether such a deal was close.
""Ahead of us lies painstaking work to create the conditions for us to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution,"" Putin said as he stood alongside Abe.
""Of course, solutions proposed by negotiators should be acceptable for the peoples of Russia and Japan, supported by the societies of both our countries.""
Opinion polls show that the majority of Russian people are opposed to the idea of Russia giving up control of the islands in order to achieve a deal.
Abe said he had agreed with Putin that the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers would meet in February to continue talks about a possible deal. 

The Japanese leader also said an agreement was reached that the Japanese and Russian militaries would build closer ties.

Knossos Palace in Crete was one of the priceless items put into the fund - a holding company owned by the Greek state - to satisfy Greece's foreign creditors under the last financial bailout in 2015.
The fund also oversees several state utilities, a bailout fund for Greek banks and the privatization agency. 
The government has repeatedly denied the site and monuments could be sold, but that has not prevented protests, including a one-day strike by archaeologists in October which closed the Acropolis, an attraction for millions of Athens visitors every year. 
""The cultural assets are exempted,"" Culture Minister Myrsini Zorba told reporters on Tuesday, announcing a ministerial decree on the matter. ""We have 2,330 assets which are protected through a legal act and we can now rest."" 
One of those assets is Spinalonga, a small island that was a leper colony until 1957 and featured in Victoria Hislop's best-selling book ""The Island"".

Zorba said a full list of the assets would be published later.

KABUL (Reuters) - With one of the deadliest attacks of Afghanistan's 17-year insurgency just hours before a new round of peace talks, the Taliban rammed home its message that it intends to agree any settlement from a position of strength on the battlefield.
The attack, carried out with a captured military Humvee packed with explosives, killed as many as 100 or more soldiers, police and pro government militiamen at a base in Maidan Wardak province west of Kabul. The base had been run by the National Directorate for Security, the country's main spy agency.
""The Taliban are doing exactly what they want to do and if it goes on like this then one day we will have Maidan Wardak province fall into the hands of Taliban,"" said Mohammad Akbar Bakhtyari, the deputy chief of the provincial council.
Just hours later, the Taliban confirmed that talks aimed at finding a peace deal had resumed with U.S. officials in Qatar, underlining the strategy adopted by the increasingly invigorated insurgents -- an approach their American foes should understand.
""The U.S. administration's stated policy is to 'fight and talk,' so we shouldn't be surprised that the Taliban are following the same strategy and conducting high profile attacks to strengthen their position at the negotiating table,"" said Andrew Wilder, vice president of the Asia program at the United States Institute of Peace.
Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have been targeting Taliban commanders, but questions have been raised over the future of U.S. involvement by reports that President Donald Trump wants to bring home almost half of the 14,000 U.S. troops.
Attacks like those on Monday make it harder for Afghanistan's government to show that it can defend itself if the Americans pull out.
The training provided to Afghan forces, the government's intelligence gathering and their assessment of the ground reality all need an overhaul, said a Western diplomat in Kabul.
""The foreign forces provide the training but it all comes down to coordination and effective leadership. That is clearly missing,"" the diplomat said.
It is a message being carried into the provinces with the bodies of the dead.
Thirteen victims of Monday's attack were repatriated to Laghman province in the east of the country for burial on Tuesday. ""If one of our sons is martyred, we send two more to serve the government, but unfortunately the government cannot defend its soldiers,"" said Shah Wali, a relative of one of them, preparing for the final rites.
LOSING TRUST
After remaining tight-lipped over the casualty toll throughout Monday, the NDS on Tuesday said 36 people were killed and 58 injured in the attack. The figures were below those reported by other government and security sources.
A senior defense source on Monday said 126 Afghan security force members were killed. Two senior security officials in Kabul on Tuesday morning said at least 72 men who were being trained by the intelligence agency were killed at the base and 38 were critically injured.
Video footage showed the collapsed base, which was used by the NDS to train local pro-government military members, nestled among snow-capped mountains with its roof partially caved in.
The government has stopped publishing casualty figures to prevent morale being undermined among security forces suffering what U.S. commanders say are ""unsustainable"" casualties. Critics say the move is aimed at hiding reality.
""When a soldier sees his comrades die in an incident and knows about the whole reality, but the government or his superior lie about it, that soldier loses the trust,"" said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a former general who served in the Afghan army between 1960 and 2009.
The increasingly confident Taliban now control broad swathes of the countryside outside the main cities, asserting their authority by collecting taxes and running administrative services as government forces struggle to push them back.
Last week, the insurgents claimed responsibility for a deadly car-bomb attack on a heavily fortified compound in Kabul housing staff working for international organizations. Five people were killed including an Indian national.
""The government doesn't have a precise security plan,"" said Hassan Reza Yusofi, a provincial councillor in Ghazni province, a province next door to Maidan Wardak. The Taliban overran Ghazni's regional capital for several days in August and still hold some districts.

""We have said this many times, that if the situation goes on like this then we are only going to lose more and more soldiers and at this rate we will witness the fall of provinces faster than ever before.""

SANA earlier said the person killed was the driver of the vehicle, a Suzuki minivan, that blew up in the Sahat al-Hamam district. 
It reported that the authorities had dismantled another explosive device in the same location before the blast.
Latakia, located on the Mediterranean coast, has stayed in government hands throughout Syria's eight years of civil war, avoiding the fighting that caused massive damage and casualties in most other major cities.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ship in deadly Black Sea blaze was turned away from port over sanctions,"By Damir Khalmetov and Alexander Ershov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two ships ablaze in the Black Sea region, leaving at least 10 crew dead, caught fire while transferring fuel mid-sea after one vessel was barred from using its usual port in southern Russia due to U.S. sanctions risk, two sources told Reuters.
The vessels, which caught fire on Monday, have the same names as two gas-transporting tankers, the Maestro and Venice, which were included on a U.S. sanctions advisory note last year for delivering fuel to Syria.
The U.S. Treasury note, published in November, advised that any dealings with these or other vessels involved in transporting fuel to Syria could result in sanctions.
The Maestro was subsequently barred from using Temryuk port in southern Russia by the owners of its only gas terminal, Maktren-Nafta, two industry sources said, where it had previously loaded liquefied petroleum gas of Russian and Kazakh origin for export to the Middle East.
The Russian company Maktren-Nafta could not be reached for comment.
Vessels can resort to ship-to-ship transfers of fuel -- a risky maneuver especially if they are transferring flammable fuel -- if they do not have access to a port for loading.
Temryuk port did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to reach the owners of the vessels. 
Russia's Transport Ministry said the two ships caught fire on Monday while loading gas ship-to-ship mid-sea, during stormy conditions. 
Russia permits loading of gas at just three locations in the region - all on-land ports - a source in the ministry said.
""All ship-to-ship transfers, especially of such dangerous cargo, moreover during stormy weather and in the winter, raises big questions,"" the source said. 
The ministry source said they did not know whether the tanker had been barred from the port, but added that doing so was within the rights of the owners of the gas loading terminal.
Fire rages on Black Sea ships: https://tmsnrt.rs/2R6vTW8
ROUGH SEA
Ten sailors out of a combined crew of 32 were confirmed dead by the ministry's maritime unit on Tuesday. A further 10 remain missing, presumed dead, while 12 were rescued, it added. 
The crew was made up of 16 Turkish citizens and 15 from India, the ministry said.
The ships are still on fire and no attempts are being made to put out the blaze due to rough sea conditions, a ministry spokesman said. 
Refinitiv data showed Milano Shipping as the owner of the Venice, and Maestro Shipping of the Maestro. The Venice was recently renamed as the Candy, one industry source said.
But two traders, separate to the industry sources, told Reuters that both vessels were ultimately owned by one Turkish company, Milenyum Denizcilik Gemi.
Milenyum was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in 2015 for arranging the shipment of liquefied petroleum gas and gasoil to Syrian government controlled areas.
Phone numbers for Milenyum and Milano Shipping, listed online, were not answered. 
SANCTIONS LIST
On Nov. 20 last year, the U.S. Treasury Department added nine Russian and Iranian individuals and companies on its sanctions list for participating in the shipment of petroleum to Syria.
It also issued an advisory note warning of the potential sanctions risk for any entities involved in such shipments which listed 35 ships, including the Maestro and Venice, as having delivered oil to Syria between 2016 and 2018.
Reuters reported in December that both the Maestro and Venice continued operations after the U.S. announcement, and regularly entered Temryuk port, according to Refinitiv data. 
After the Reuters report, the Maestro was barred from using the port's gas terminal by its owners, and thereby denied access to the port, the two industry sources said. 
But the Venice - now known as Candy - continued to dock at Temryuk, Refinitiv data showed.
""There's every indication that some black scheme was going on,"" one of the industry sources said. 
""Why else would (the Venice) load up with gas and then immediately transfer it onto another tanker?"" the source said, adding that the Venice was likely to have been permitted access to the port as it had changed its name to Candy since the U.S. sanctions note.
Since the U.S. announcement, the Venice/Candy has traveled to near the Lebanese and Syrian coastline on three occasions, Refinitiv data showed on Tuesday, while the Maestro has made the same journey once. 
The data does not show at which port the vessels finally docked. They appear to turn around before reaching the coast. 
Vessels wishing to conceal their location have been known to switch off their transponders and ""go dark"". 
Though ships are allowed to switch off their signaling systems in certain circumstances, for example for reasons of security, such instances are relatively limited and rare, Richard Meade, managing editor of Lloyd's List Intelligence in London said.
""Both vessels weren't showing up as live... despite being fairly close to land-based receivers,"" Meade said. ""This certainly would raise red flags in terms of anybody looking at the accident or criminal investigation.""
The Maestro's signaling system last reported its location on Saturday, when it was located off the coast of Turkey in the Black Sea, according to Refinitiv data.
But on Monday, it was near the Kerch Strait, a body of water between Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, which connects the Azov Sea to the Black Sea.
There, it met the Venice, which had left Temryuk port on Sunday morning with a fresh cargo of liquefied petroleum gas, an industry source said. 

After attempting to transfer the highly flammable fuel, both ships were on fire.

In April last year, it launched an investigation into whether Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer married to a member of the Swedish Academy that picks the literature prize winner, had evaded taxes.
""The investigation has been closed into the person connected to the Swedish Academy as even a potential conviction would probably not have led to any increase in the sentence he has already received,"" the ECA said in a statement.
Last year, Arnault was convicted of rape and sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison.
Last week, the Academy said his wife, poet Katarina Frostenson, had leaked the names of previous prize winners to Arnault and that she would quit. 
She has denied the allegation.
The accusations against Arnault, who ran a cultural club with Frostenson that received money from the Academy, caused a feud among members and several have since quit. 
The Nobel Foundation, which controls the prize money donated by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, has warned it could drop the Academy from awarding the prestigious prize. 

The turmoil led to no Nobel Prize in literature being awarded in 2018. Two winners will be picked this year.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - A trial of four Kenyan policemen accused of killing the son of a British aristocrat began in a Mombasa court on Tuesday, with prosecutors saying they plan to bring 45 witnesses to testify.
Naftali Chege, Charles Wangombe Munyiri, Baraka Bulima and John Pamba are charged with the killing in May 2012 of 28-year-old Alexander Monson.
Monson was found dead in his jail cell after being arrested for what the police said was smoking cannabis during a night out in Diani, near Mombasa on Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast.
Hilary Monson, Alexander's mother, told the court in Mombasa that her son was not a drug addict at the time of his death, contradicting claims by police that he died of a drug overdose.
""I know my son, like many youths, used drugs. He had a problem at one point but he had gone through a great deal of suffering to sort himself out,"" she said.
Alexander Monson's family and local rights groups demanded an inquest into his death which found there had been attempts to cover up what had happened and threats against witnesses.
Two reports by government pathologists, seen by Reuters, concluded that he had died after suffering a traumatic blow to the head.
""We are very concerned that it has taken already a very long period and they say that justice delayed is justice denied,"" said Hussein Khalid, director of local rights group Haki Africa.
At their first appearance in court in July, the accused denied the charges.
Presiding judge Erick Ogola said he would give the case top priority, adding: ""I will expect all parties involved to be cooperative.""

Miners had been drilling day and night to create the shaft 60 meters (197 ft) deep, which they finished on Monday and started lining with thick metal pipes. Their hope was to be able to cut across by Tuesday to find the toddler, Julen.
""Technical difficulties have cropped up with the casing of the well after the depth of 40 meters,"" said a spokeswoman for the regional government at the site, adding that the thick metal pipes will be removed and drilling resumed.
""It is impossible to estimate how long it will take. The operation has already begun,"" she said. 
Julen fell down the borehole shaft as his family walked through a private estate in Totalan, Malaga. 
There have been no signs of life since.
Rescuers found that the borehole - 100 meters (300 feet) deep and just 25 cm (10 inches) wide - was blocked with earth, raising fears that soil had collapsed onto the child.
Engineers have said that digging the horizontal passage would be the most dangerous part of the effort. Spanish miners and engineers have been joined by workers from a Swedish firm who helped locate 33 Chilean miners rescued after 69 days underground more than seven years ago. 
Children and families have been holding candlelight vigils across Spain in support of the missing boy.

El Pais reported that his parents suffered another tragedy in 2017 when their three-year-old son died suddenly after suffering a cardiac arrest while walking along a beach.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis heads to Panama on Wednesday where he is expected to highlight the problems of poverty, immigration and human rights at a gathering of young Catholics.
The Jan. 23-28 trip for the Church's World Youth Day will be Francis' first to Central America, a region that has been caught up in a migration crisis as thousands of people try to make their way north to the United States to seek asylum or jobs.
When he visited Mexico in February 2016, Francis criticized then presidential candidate Donald Trump's pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration.
""Many of the young people in that region are immigrants ... I think we can expect references (to the migration crisis) from the Holy Father,"" Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti told reporters.
The border wall is again a hot topic in the United States, which is in the throes of a partial government shutdown as now President Trump is insisting on his demand to fund the barrier as part of any bill to fully reopen the government.
Since mid-October, thousands of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, have traveled north through Mexico in a caravan, some walking much of the long trek to try to reach the United States.
At that time, Francis denounced ""a wave of closure toward the foreigner"".
Many migrants are seeking asylum, saying they suffer from violence and human rights abuses in their native countries. Those topics are also expected to be themes of the trip, papal aides say.
The 82-year-old Francis, now in the sixth year of his papacy, is also scheduled to visit a juvenile prison and a hospice for AIDS sufferers.
World Youth Day, held in a different city about every three years, has been dubbed the ""Catholic Woodstock"", a jamboree where young people celebrate their faith and discuss social issues.
About 150,000 have registered for this year's event, being held in Latin America for only the third time since the late Pope John Paul instituted it in 1985.
Several hundred thousand people are expected at the final Mass at a park on Sunday that will be open to all residents and visitors to the country of 4 million people, which is about 89 percent Catholic.
Francis told Reuters in June he had wanted to make a stop in nearby El Salvador to pray at the tomb of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was shot by a right-wing death squad in 1980 because of his denunciations of human rights abuses and government repression. 

Francis later decided to make a longer trip to El Salvador sometime in the future. But many young people from the country will travel to Panama to help the pope commemorate Romero, who was made a saint last October and is considered an icon of the Latin American Church.

LONDON (Reuters) - British opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn moved a step closer to paving the way for another referendum on European Union membership by trying to use parliament to grab control of Brexit from Prime Minister Theresa May.
With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
Since May's divorce deal with the EU was rejected by 432-202 lawmakers last week, the biggest defeat in modern British history, lawmakers have been trying to plot a course out of the crisis, yet no option has the majority support of parliament.
Labour put forward an amendment seeking to force the government to give parliament time to consider and vote on options to prevent a ""no deal"" exit including a customs union with the EU, and ""a public vote on a deal"".
""It is time for Labour’s alternative plan to take center stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote,"" said Corbyn, who put his name to the amendment.
It was the first time the Labour leadership had put forward in parliament the possibility of a second vote, which was welcomed by some opponents of Brexit. 
However, the party said it did not mean it supported another referendum and lawmakers cautioned that the amendment would not garner the support of parliament.
Clarity from London is some way off: lawmakers have so far put forward six amendments with proposals for a delay to Brexit, a new vote and even for parliament to grab control of the process. They will vote on the next steps on Jan. 29.
""WORST CASE SCENARIO""
Beyond the intrigues of British politics, the future of Brexit remains deeply unpredictable with options ranging from a disorderly exit that would spook investors across the world to a new referendum that could reverse the whole process.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told CNBC on Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit was ""obviously the worst case scenario"".
Ever since the United Kingdom voted by 52-48 percent to leave the EU in June 2016, Britain's leaders have repeatedly failed to reach a consensus on how to leave the EU.
May on Monday proposed tweaking her deal, a bid to win over rebel Conservative lawmakers and the Northern Irish party which props up her government, but Labour said May was in denial about the crushing defeat of her plans.
She refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit, warning that another referendum would strengthen the hand of those seeking to break up the United Kingdom and could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in democracy.
With May's Brexit policy in tatters, lawmakers in the British parliament are trying to wrest control of Brexit, though there is no clear majority for an alternative to May's deal.
The EU was not impressed with May's speech on Monday, as highlighted by the fact that none of its top officials nor its Brexit negotiator made any comments - positive or negative. 
German Justice Minister Katarina Barley said on Tuesday she was disappointed by British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to break a deadlock over Brexit and suggested Britain hold a second referendum.
Without a approved deal or an alternative, the world's fifth largest economy will move to basic World Trade Organization rules on March 29 — a nightmare scenario for manufacturers dependent on delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.
Company chiefs are shocked at the political crisis and say it has already damaged Britain’s reputation as Europe’s pre-eminent destination for foreign investment.
""Brexit is the most stupid economic decision for a long time, the worst thing that can happen,"" Kasper Rorsted, boss of German sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGN), told the Suddeutsche Zeitung. 
Asked if Brexit could be averted, he said: ""I think the train has already left the station. Emotionally, I hope that all parties can come to their senses.""

Supporters of Brexit say that while there may be some short-term disruption, the warnings of chaos are overblown and that in the long term, Britain will thrive if it cuts loose from what they cast as a doomed German-dominated experiment in European unity.

Nazli Ilicak was sentenced to life in prison along with five other journalists last February for aiding plotters of a 2016 failed coup attempt. All six of the journalists, including Ilicak, have denied the charges.
On Tuesday, the court sentenced Ilicak to five years and 10 months in prison in a separate case where she was charged with ""sharing information that needed to remain secret for the security of the state"", Anadolu said.
Ilicak, a journalist, columnist and former lawmaker, had also been sentenced to 14 months in prison last year for insulting the president, a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey. 
Along with Ilicak, two prominent journalist brothers - Ahmet and Mehmet Altan - were sentenced to life in prison last February. The case had underscored deep concern about press freedom and the independence of the judiciary in Turkey under President Tayyip Erdogan.
The government blames followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for masterminding the coup, and has waged a crackdown on suspected members of his network since then. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup and condemned it.
Since the abortive putsch some 77,000 people have been jailed and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors.
Rights groups and Turkey's western allies have voiced alarm over the scale of the crackdown, saying Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.
The government, however, rejects the criticism and says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the security threat it faces.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has revoked special visas for European Union diplomats and officials traveling regularly between Beirut and Damascus, complicating efforts to distribute aid to civil war victims, three senior EU diplomats said.
Since conflict broke out in Syria in 2011, the EU has used the Lebanese capital, the nearest major city, for its diplomatic base while closing most embassies in Damascus in protest over what they describe as Assad's brutal assault on the opposition. 
But the special permission to use multiple-entry Syrian visas for access to Damascus was rescinded at the start of January with no explanation from the Syrian government, the EU diplomats said, meaning personnel have to apply for time-consuming, single-entry visas every time they wish to travel.
The EU diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believed it was an attempt to try to force European governments and the bloc to re-open embassies in Damascus, as the Syrian army, backed by Russian and Iranian forces, regains control of most of the country.
""It's a serious problem for the EU's humanitarian assistance,"" said one EU diplomat. ""This is a measure that hits diplomats and staff of European government embassies and the European Union institutions."" 
Reuters was unable immediately to reach Syrian Foreign Ministry officials for comment. 
After more than seven years of a devastating war drawing in foreign powers, the European Commission, the EU executive, has channeled almost 800 million euros ($909.44 million) on food, medicine and shelter for Syrians inside the country.
There was no immediate available estimate for the impact of the multi-visa ban, but a Commission spokesman said that the bloc was ""doing everything in our power to take appropriate measures to minimize any impact on the delivery of EU humanitarian assistance inside Syria.""
SANCTIONS 
The European Union, which imposed the latest in a series of economic sanctions on Assad's government on Monday, says it will not shift its policy until a political transition away from Assad is underway as part of a U.N.-led peace process.
But EU diplomats also say Assad feels far more secure in his position than several years ago as he consolidates territorial advances and other countries reconsider their positions.
""So far, the EU is united on its policy that we won't deal with Assad, but he appears to feel his bargaining position is stronger now,"" a second diplomat said.
The United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus in December, a significant shift for a U.S.-allied Arab state that once backed rebels fighting him. Also in December, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir became the first Arab head of state to visit Damascus since the start of the Syrian conflict, flying into Damascus airport.
Syria's possible rehabilitation by its Arab peers is also under consideration, as the Arab League debates whether to end its membership suspension. Leaders of the EU and the Arab League will hold a rare, two-day summit in Cairo from Feb. 24.
The U.S. withdrawal from Syria also appears to have emboldened Assad, the diplomats said. The U.S. departure from the quarter of Syria held by Kurdish-led forces could allow to regain control over the area, home to much of the country's natural resources.

Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring the Islamic State militant group had been defeated there, a view not shared by many experts.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>","Cast in Russia as 'enemy within', Jehovah's Witnesses see Soviet history replay","By Andrew Osborn
ORYOL, Russia (Reuters) - The first Jehovah's Witness detained for extremism in Russia has likened the authorities' behavior to that of Josef Stalin's Soviet Union ahead of a verdict in his trial. 
Armed police scaled the gates of a compound where the Christian denomination was meeting in Oryol, some 200 miles (320 km) south of Moscow, in May 2017 and detained Dennis Christensen, a Danish national, on extremism charges.
He has spent the last 20 months in a cold cell with suspected drug dealers and only been allowed to meet his wife, separated by bars and a corridor, twice a month. If convicted, he could spend up to a decade in jail. 
The trial of the 46-year-old builder is seen by the United States and the European Union as a litmus test for religious freedom, and the latest twist in a worsening East-West standoff. 
The U.S.-headquartered Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.
But Russia's latest falling-out with the West, triggered by Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, spurred a more determined drive to push out ""the enemy within"".
After Crimea was seized, a giant poster hung in central Moscow bearing the faces of Kremlin critics and labeling them as ""a fifth column"". One of them, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, was later shot dead.
""HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF"" 
It was in that atmosphere that a court in Oryol outlawed the local Jehovah's Witnesses in 2016, and Russia's Supreme Court in 2017 found the group to be an ""extremist"" organization and ordered it to disband nationwide.
More than 100 criminal cases have been opened against Jehovah's Witnesses and some of their publications are on a list of banned extremist literature.
""I'm afraid that history is now repeating itself,"" Christiansen told Reuters in an interview carried out over two days, during breaks in his trial. 
""I'm afraid that it's actually like Stalin has come back.""
The atheist Soviet Union regarded Jehovah's Witnesses as anti-Soviet because of their refusal to serve in the army. Under Stalin, hundreds of their leaders were jailed and thousands were deported to Siberia in 1951 after much of their property was confiscated. 
The group has around 8 million active followers around the world and has faced court proceedings in several countries, mostly over its pacifism and rejection of blood transfusions. Russia has been the most outspoken in portraying it as an extremist cult.
Christensen, whose trial is due to conclude within weeks, is accused of continuing to organize group activities in Oryol despite the local ban.
RIGHT TO PRACTISE RELIGION 
His lawyer, Anton Bogdanov, contends that the ban applied to the group's legal entity only and did not prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from continuing to practise their religion. 
Article 28 of the Russian constitution guarantees the right to practise any or no religion. 
Speaking from a glass cage in the courtroom, Christiansen denied organizing the activities of an extremist group, but said he feared he would be sentenced to at least six years in jail.
""Of course I hope that he (the judge) will be just,"" he said. ""But I also know which country I’ve been living in.""
Court hearings have heard that Christiansen had his phones tapped for nine months and that someone infiltrated the Jehovah's Witnesses in Oryol and secretly filmed them. 
Irina, his wife, said she found it hard to believe that Russia was going after Jehovah's Witnesses after recognizing that the Soviet Union's treatment of them had been illegal. 
""They’re being persecuted again for the same thing – their beliefs,"" she said.
""The only difference is that at that time they were called 'enemies of the people'. Now they are called 'extremists'.""
She said the crackdown was only helping the group to attract more followers in Russia, where it has around 170,000 adherents, including some 300 in Oryol. 

""It’s good advertising,"" she said. ""I’m not afraid of anything and Dennis is not afraid either.""

AACHEN, Germany (Reuters) - The leaders of France and Germany signed a new treaty on Tuesday to update their 1963 post-war reconciliation accord, aiming to reinvigorate the European Union's main axis as growing eurosceptic nationalism tests the bloc's cohesion.
At a warm ceremony in the German border city of Aachen, a historical symbol of European concord, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron sought to show they are ready to give fresh leadership to the troubled EU project.
The leaders want the 16-page Aachen Treaty, negotiated over the past year to update the 1963 Elysee Treaty of post-war reconciliation, to give an impulse to European unity that has been strained by Brexit, immigration and the euro zone crisis.
""We are doing this because we live in special times and because in these times we need resolute, distinct, clear, forward-looking answers,"" said Merkel, noting Aachen was home to Charlemagne, whom she dubbed ""the father of Europe"".
Macron added: ""At a time when Europe is threatened by nationalism, which is growing from within, when Europe is shaken by the pains of Brexit and worried by global changes that go far beyond the national level ... Germany and France must assume their responsibility and show the way forward.""
Short on detail, the treaty extension commits to closer foreign and defense policy ties but does little to push forward euro zone economic reform.
Sabine von Oppeln, expert on Franco-German ties at Berlin's Free University, said of the slow progress on euro zone reform: ""The German side is not responding to Macron's ideas, which are of course also driven by national interests.""
""This could be an opportunity for a real renewal of cooperation but I fear the chance has been lost,"" she added.
DEFENSE COOPERATION
Franco-German treaties are supposed to be milestones in the process of European integration, paving the way for the bloc as a whole to deepen cooperation.
""Today Europe needs a revival of faith in the meaning of solidarity and unity, and I want to believe that enhanced Franco-German cooperation will serve this objective,"" said European Council chief Donald Tusk, who attended the ceremony with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
However, Merkel and Macron, both of whom have struggled to maintain their authority over their own domestic politics, have failed this time to produce the wide-ranging vision to really enthuse europhiles.
The Aachen document stipulates that it will be a priority of German-French diplomacy for Germany to be accepted as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Germany has for years sought greater influence within the international body, to which its closest allies the United States, Britain and France belong.
While making clear that Germany and France remain committed to the EU and NATO defense alliance, the agreement also signals that Berlin and Paris will combat efforts by some nationalist politicians in Europe to erode the 28-nation EU.
Facing new challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump in the United States as well as EU governments in Italy, Poland and Hungary, Merkel and Macron are keen to head off any breakthrough for eurosceptic parties in a European Parliament vote in May.
As Merkel waited to welcome Macron at the Aachen city hall to sign the updated treaty, some people gathered outside with blue and yellow EU balloons. Another group wore the yellow vests adopted by members of a grassroots rebellion against Macron.
Eurosceptics also voiced their opposition. Alexander Gauland, leader in parliament of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), said: ""The EU is now deeply divided. A German-French special relationship will alienate us even further from the other Europeans.""

The original Elysee Treaty was signed in 1963 by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and President Charles de Gaulle, who in the same year vetoed the British application to join the European Community, the precursor of today's European Union.

HAIFA (Reuters) - Israel's Arab lawmakers plan to commandeer Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim in the last election that Arabs were heading to the polls ""in droves"" to encourage their own voters in April's election.
Netanyahu's election-day message to mobilize his right-wing voter base became a defining moment of the 2015 election, drawing criticism and accusations of racism from across the globe. Netanyahu, who won the election, later apologized. 
Now Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List party said he plans to use Netanyahu's phrase, which has become an iconic and sometimes ironic part of the language in Israel, to whip up turnout amongst the Arab minority in the April 9 vote.
""Arabs are not going to forget Netanyahu's incitement,"" Odeh told Reuters. ""Netanyahu benefited from the slogan the first time around. Now it is our turn to benefit."" 
Netanyahu is seeking a fifth term in office. If successful, he will become Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
The party will run the slogan in Arabic and Hebrew, said Odeh, whose faction holds 13 of the 120 Knesset seats. 
Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom identify as Palestinian, comprise mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their homes or were internally displaced after the 1948 Arab-Jewish war that surrounded Israel's creation.
Today they make up just over one-fifth of Israel's population. Although the Arab minority has full equal rights, many say their communities face discrimination and are treated as second-class citizens. 
Arab citizens have typically turned out to vote at a rate below the national average, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.
Odeh said that the Arab lawmakers' main task will be to convince potential voters that their participation can effect real change, even if no Arab party has ever been included in an Israeli government coalition. 
‮S‬o far polls show Netanyahu's Likud will be the largest party in parliament with around 30 seats. The Joint List, a coalition of four parties, may split in to two, each taking about six seats.
Odeh said a key campaign issue will be Israel's ""nation state"" law, passed in 2018. It said only Jews had the right of self-determination in the ""historic homeland of the Jewish people"" and downgrades Arabic as an official state language on a par with Hebrew.
The law angered the Arab minority and Israeli left-wing and center-ground politicians, many of whom opposed its passage in parliament. The bill's supporters said it was largely symbolic and Netanyahu said it was needed to fend of Palestinian challenges to Jewish self-determination. [L5N1V20CX]

""I can argue that if we had only voted in greater numbers, we would have been able to block the law,"" Odeh said. ""They simply wouldn't be able to ignore us.""

Police said in a statement that three Molotov cocktails caused unspecified damage to the station in the early hours of Tuesday but nobody was hurt. They reinforced patrols to guarantee residents' safety.
Police said their investigation could not establish any links to a rally in central Lisbon on Monday night, which followed a police raid on a slum in Seixal, on the outskirts of the capital south of the Tagus River. Setubal is about 50 kilometers south of Lisbon. 
On Sunday police responding to a call about a brawl between two women entered the Jamaican neighborhood in Seixal, where mostly black local residents allegedly greeted them with a hail of stones. 
A video published on the internet showed police officers beating up several black men. Four local residents and one police officer were lightly injured and treated in hospital. One person was arrested.
Rights group SOS Racismo said the police response was unjustified and requested that the prosecutor's office open an investigation.
On Monday night, about two hundred mostly black protesters blocked Lisbon's Avenida da Liberdade thoroughfare, chanting ""Down with racism!"". Stones were thrown at police officers who dispersed the rally.
Police said on Tuesday that one person was arrested on suspicion of torching four vehicles and a dozen garbage cans on Monday night in greater Lisbon's Odivelas district.
There are several poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of Lisbon where immigrants mostly from Portugal's African ex-colonies live.
Race-related violence is rare in Portugal but in one incident in 2015 18 police officers were charged with crimes motivated by racism.

ROME (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, continuing a war of words between Rome and Paris, said on Tuesday that France was not looking to bring calm to violence-ravaged Libya because its energy interests there rivaled those of Italy.
Relations between Italy and France, traditionally close allies, have grown frosty since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition last year and took aim at pro-EU French President Emmanuel Macron.
France's Foreign Ministry and the French president's office declined to respond immediately.
On Monday France summoned Italy's ambassador after Salvini's fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa and generating mass migration to Europe.
Salvini backed up Di Maio, saying France was looking to extract wealth from Africa rather than helping countries develop their own economies, and pointed particularly to Libya, which has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
""In Libya, France has no interest in stabilizing the situation, probably because it has oil interests that are opposed to those of Italy,"" Salvini told Canale 5 TV station.
A French diplomatic source said it was not the first time that Salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by Di Maio. 
The source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that French efforts in Libya were aimed at stabilizing the country, preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows.
Italy's Eni and France's Total have separate joint ventures in Libya, but Eni's CEO Claudio Descalzi denied in a newspaper interview last year that there was any conflict between the two firms in the north African state.
Salvini is head of the League, while Di Maio leads 5-Star. Both are campaigning hard for European parliamentary elections in May and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of center-left and center-right parties.
The two men have repeatedly targeted neighboring France and accused Macron of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly African migrants who have reached Italy from Libya in recent years.

Asked about the latest diplomatic spat with Paris, Salvini said on Tuesday: ""France has no reason to get upset because it pushed away tens of thousands of migrants (at the French border), abandoning them there as though they were beasts. We won't take any lessons on humanity from Macron.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea are struggling to narrow differences over the share of the cost of maintaining U.S. troops after a U.S. demand for a 50 percent increase in the South's contribution, a South Korean lawmaker said on Tuesday. 
Despite 10 rounds of talks since March, the allies have failed to strike an accord to replace a 2014 deal that expired last year, which requires South Korea to pay about 960 billion won ($848 million) a year for keeping some 28,500 U.S. troops there.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that South Korea, where the United States has stationed soldiers since the 1950-53 Korean War, should bear more of the cost.
The U.S. military has warned Korean workers on its bases they might be put on leave from mid-April if no deal is reached.
At their last meeting, in December, the United States made a ""sudden, unacceptable"" demand that South Korea pay more than 1.4 trillion won per year, about 1.5 times its current contribution, according to Hong Young-pyo, a senior ruling party legislator.
Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha briefed a group of lawmakers on the talks on Monday. Any deal is subject to parliamentary approval. 
""The negotiations were deadlocked,"" Hong told a meeting with lawmakers. ""The U.S. side suddenly made a proposal at the last stage which was difficult for us to accept.""
A spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Seoul declined to comment. 
When asked about the U.S. demand on Monday, Kang declined to specify numbers but said there was a ""very big difference"" in the positions between the two countries. 
""We'll work to reach an agreement that's reasonable, affordable and explainable to the National Assembly and the people,"" Kang told reporters.
Kang Seok-ho, another lawmaker who attended the foreign minister's briefing, said the government's stance was not to pay more than 1 trillion won a year and an agreement should be valid for five years, not one year as reportedly sought by the United States.
DEADLOCK
With another meeting not scheduled, the stalemate raises concerns about the funding gap and the posture of the 70-year alliance amid signs of a rift over North Korea policy. 
About 70 percent of South Korea's contribution covers the salaries of some 8,700 South Korean employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military.
Trump announced a halt to joint exercises with South Korea in June, after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying they were very expensive and paid for mostly by his country. 
Major joint exercises have since been suspended, which Washington said would expedite talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program, though some small-scale exercises have continued. 
U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris met South Korea's national security advisor Chung Eui-yong late last month to urge a swift agreement, warning that the United States may consider implementing the defense treaty ""in a different way"", South Korea's Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified diplomatic source. 
South Korea's foreign ministry confirmed Harris had visited Chung but declined to give details. 
The U.S. embassy spokesman declined to comment, citing ""confidential diplomatic discussions"".

North Korean state media has recently increased complaints about South Korea's military ties to the United States, but South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, has said reducing U.S. military commitments would be an unlikely option for Washington.

The proposal has President Rodrigo Duterte's support and is being revived by his Congressional allies, having been filed on his inauguration day in 2016 along with a bid to re-introduce the death penalty - moves touting his crime-busting credentials.
The plan was approved on Monday by the lower house's justice committee, but still needs several readings before a house vote. It would then require counterpart legislation and approval of the Senate, members of which appear less supportive.
""It is anti-family, anti-poor and simply unjust. Moreover, it will promote a heartless and ruthless society that has no regard for its own people,"" said Antonio Trillanes, one of Duterte's biggest critics.
Risa Hontiveros said the idea went against Philippines' international commitments and a global trend of raising, not lowering, the criminal age.
""Why do we want to slide back to the minimum, or even below the minimum? Is this a race to the bottom?"" she told a Senate hearing.
Duterte campaigned aggressively on eliminating crime, drugs and corruption and has said he has since realized they were all on a greater scale than he had imagined.
Despite a war on drugs that has killed thousands of people and graft-related scandals and resignations of his own appointees, Duterte has not lost his luster among Filipinos, who polls show back his morality-centered approach to law and order.
Senator Panfilo Lacson said nine was too young, but he supported lowering the age ""to a certain level"". Joel Villanueva said the bill needed a rethink, to target parents more.
""Children in general have different levels of maturity and discernment,"" he added.
International organizations have expressed alarm, including UNICEF and Save the Children, while domestic activists said children should be protected from criminals, not held liable for things they were forced to do.
Agnes Callamard, a United Nations special rapporteur who has frequently locked horns with Duterte, called it a ""dangerous and potentially deadly proposal. Just shameful"". 
Justice committee chairman Salvador Leachon, however, said the bill was misunderstood, and was rehabilitation-centered, and ""pro-children"", with non-compliant parents the ones who would go to jail.

""The point here is there is no punishment,"" he told news channel ANC. ""It's rehabilitation, reformative, taking care of the family.""

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa promised on Tuesday to investigate violence against civilians who joined protests and punish any misconduct by security forces, as the country's rights commission said civilians were being systematically tortured.
Police say three people died during violent demonstrations last week, but human rights groups say evidence suggests at least a dozen were killed, giving rise to fears that - under Mnangagwa's leadership - Zimbabwe is sliding back into authoritarian rule. 
The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) said on Tuesday security forces instigated systematic torture of residents following the violent unrest that erupted last week after a steep hike in the price of fuel. The level of force used on those who died or injured and supported by medical reports pointed to police brutality, a ZHRC commissioner told reporters.
In his first public comments since cutting short a foreign trip and returning to Harare late on Monday, the president said ""violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe.""
""Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll,"" Mnangagwa wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, calling for a ""national dialogue"" involving churches, civil society and the opposition.
The unrest drove Mnangagwa to cancel an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he had been expected to pitch for foreign investments, and fly home. 
Hundreds of civilians, including activist pastor Evan Mawarire and opposition lawmakers, have been detained since demonstrations that were triggered nine days ago by 150 percent hikes in price of fuel decreed by Mnangagwa. 
He said on Tuesday that that increase had been necessary.
'BEATINGS AT SAFE HOUSE'
Several opposition politicians and rights activists have gone into hiding as authorities try to track them down. Lawyers and ZHRC say security forces have raided homes of suspected protesters at night and beaten up occupants, charges denied by the police and army.
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said police arrested 28 men late on Monday who were receiving treatment at a safe house after beatings by soldiers.
Police could not immediately comment on those arrests.
A spokesman for Mnangagwa, who became leader after long-time leader Robert Mugabe was forced out in November 2017, said on Sunday that the crackdown was a foretaste of how authorities would respond to future unrest.
That, along with an internet blackout, has fueled fears that the country is sliding back into Mugabe-era authoritarianism. A judge on Monday ordered that communications shutdown to be rescinded. [L8N1ZL2MO]
Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said there was an urgent need for dialogue.
""The arrest of labor leaders and opposition members is a familiar script in Africa. We have called for dialogue until our voices have gone hoarse but have been ignored,"" Mafume said.
With high inflation and a shortage of cash in circulation eating into ordinary Zimbabweans' spending power, the fragile state of the economy is at the heart of the country's political problems.

A 14-day strike notice given by public sector unions expires on Tuesday. Apex Council, which represents all civil service unions, will meet on Tuesday or Wednesday to plan its next move, its deputy chairman Thomas Muzondo said.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2019 03:24AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Some in Bangladesh election observer group say they now regret involvement,"By Zeba Siddiqui and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - A top official at an observer group that monitored Bangladesh's election, as well as one of its foreign volunteers, have said they regret participating in the process, casting doubt on the credibility of a vote won overwhelmingly by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling alliance.
The president of the SAARC Human Rights Foundation told Reuters he now believed there should be a fresh vote after hearing accounts from voters and officials presiding over polling booths that activists from Hasina's Awami League stuffed ballot boxes the night before the poll and intimidated voters.
""Now I have come to know everything, and can say that the election was not free and fair,"" said Mohammad Abdus Salam, a 75-year-old former high court division justice.
A Canadian observer who was brought in by the foundation has also said she now wishes she had not been involved.
Bangladesh, which is an important supplier of clothing to major Western High Street brands and is the second-biggest garments exporter in the world behind China, had already faced criticism from European Union, United States, and British officials for irregularities observed during the polling.
Transparency International last week said its investigation into the Dec. 30 election found irregularities at 47 of the 50 constituencies surveyed, including fake votes, ballot stuffing, and voters and opposition polling agents barred from entering polling centers. It found the ruling party was alone in actively campaigning at all areas surveyed, sometimes with help from local law enforcement officials and government resources.
The government has dismissed the Transparency International investigation as lacking in credibility. Hasina's political adviser H.T. Imam called the group ""a puppet"" of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
The BNP-led alliance has rejected the election, calling it rigged, after the Awami League and its allies swept more than 95 percent of the parliamentary seats. The United States, European Union and Britain have since called for allegations of ballot-rigging and intimidation to be investigated.
Ahead of the election, the U.S. State Department had expressed disappointment that several U.S.-funded observers had been forced to cancel plans to monitor the polls as Bangladesh didn't issue visas ""within the timeframe necessary"". Bangladesh denied delaying visas and said it was following due process.
Political experts said observers were key to establishing the credibility of the poll, which was Bangladesh's first fully participatory election in a decade. The BNP had boycotted the last vote in 2014.
VICTORY ENDORSED
The SAARC Human Rights Foundation brought in observers from Canada, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, who spoke to the press on election day and the day after, endorsing the fairness of the voting, often in glowing terms.
On New Year's Eve, hours after being declared the winner of a contest that brought her a third straight term in power, Hasina sat on a white couch at her residence to address an audience of journalists and election observers.
""They voted so enthusiastically, especially women and the young generation,"" Hasina said. ""By coming to my country, you have also given us good opportunity to show how democracy is working.""
As a microphone was passed around the room, monitors from the SAARC Human Rights Foundation as well as other observers, including those from the Saudi Arabia-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, congratulated Hasina on the win.
The first to speak was a representative of the foundation, a Canadian woman named Tanya Foster, who called the election ""very fair and democratic"". ""In Canada I feel that it is a similar type of process,"" Foster said, as Hasina smiled back. 
Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, who is the government's information and communication technology adviser, repeatedly tweeted out statements made by the foundation's observers calling the election fair and peaceful.
GOVERNMENT LINKS
Though the initials and logo it uses closely resemble those of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the SAARC Human Rights Foundation has no affiliation with that inter-governmental body.
The foundation's Secretary General Abed Ali told Reuters the group had applied for approval from SAARC and was expecting it soon. A spokesman for the Kathmandu-based SAARC, though, told Reuters it had never heard of Ali or his group. ""The organization is not recognized by SAARC and does not have any relation with SAARC whatsoever,"" the spokesman said.
The SAARC Human Rights Foundation's website says it is based in Dhaka and its initials stand for South Asian Association for Research Council.
Its advisory committee includes a lawmaker from Hasina's Awami League, and one from the Jatiya Party, which has often been allied with the Awami League. A former minister in a previous BNP government is also listed on the panel, but no current opposition members.
Bangladesh law bars the Election Commission from allowing observer groups with links to political parties from monitoring polls.
The secretary of Bangladesh's Election Commission, Helal Uddin Ahmed, said it had no knowledge of links between Ali's groups and any political party.
Referring to the Awami League and Jatiya Party lawmakers on the group's board, Ali said: ""They are just supporting our humanitarian activities.""
""I want to make it clear that we have no affiliation with any political party,"" he added.
FOREIGN OBSERVERS
But at the headquarters of the foundation, a dusty two-room ground floor apartment in the industrial town of Mirpur on the outskirts of Dhaka, there are regrets. 
Salam, the group's president, said the observers fielded by his organization had only monitored a few polling stations, so were in no position to make a clear assessment of the election's fairness. 
He said some presiding officers had told him they had been forced to stuff ballot boxes. ""I want to speak the truth,"" he told Reuters. ""I am not doing this for any political gain.""
He said he was not directly involved in organizing the poll observers.
Ali dismissed the president's comments, saying: ""Can you write something just based on someone saying something?"" 
Tanya Foster, a policy analyst in the Saskatchewan provincial government, told Reuters she had heard from Bangladeshis in Canada that a group known as the SAARC Human Rights Foundation was looking for foreign election monitors.
""I asked about the qualifications because I thought it would be an interesting experience. I applied to SAARC and to the Election Commission and they vetted me and offered me an invitation to be an observer,"" said Foster, whose daughter Chloe Foster also joined the observer's panel.
They had never acted as international observers to a national election before.
Foster said she was not aware of the foundation's links to the Awami League or the lack of affiliation to SAARC.
In hindsight, she said ""I don't feel great about it. I feel like I was too naïve"".
""I don't know that our reports are of that much value, considering we only visited nine polling centers and only in Dhaka,"" she added. ""We didn't go to the more hostile areas. We didn't audit the election commission or conduct background checks of the presiding officers or poll agents.""
Chloe Foster was not available for comment.
Ali, the foundation's secretary general, said the women had experience monitoring elections in Canada. He said it was not possible for any group to monitor all polling stations.
To be sure, not all the observers fielded by the foundation regret endorsing the voting. Gautam Ghosh, a Kolkata, India-based lawyer, and Hakimullah Muslim and Nazir Miya - members of Nepal's ruling Communist Party - said they stood by their initial statements that the polls were fair. 

""We heard of incidents of violence but never saw anything with our own eyes. We can't comment on what happened elsewhere,"" said Miya. Ghosh said he had never seen such a good election.

MADRID (Reuters) - Gabriel Diaz de Tudanca is a 19-year-old Spaniard who, although born a girl, identified as male from early childhood. 
""When I was three years old I came back from school and said to my mother that when I grew up I was going to be a man called Oscar,"" he says.
Supported by his family and friends, he has undergone surgery and hormone treatments, changed his name and renewed his identity documents to reflect what he feels is his true gender.
Reuters photographer Susana Vera accompanied him for three years through his process of change. 
In terms of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) rights, Spain ranks relatively high in surveys. But authorities require a mental health diagnosis before allowing gender change on official documents, as being transgender is classed a mental illness. 
This is the case in the majority of European countries.
""I didn't take it that badly, being diagnosed as 'mentally ill',"" he says. ""But I feel angry that you have to get that diagnosis to be able to change documents, get hormone treatment or surgery.""
The World Health Organisation ruled in June that being transgender should no longer be classified as a mental disorder. It now considers ""gender incongruence"" under sexual health conditions.
At 17, Diaz de Tudanca started with hormone treatments aimed at developing secondary sex characteristics such as voice deepening and a masculine pattern of hair and fat distribution. Around two years ago he underwent surgery to remove his breasts.
""It was a huge change in my life,"" he says of no longer having breasts. ""It's a great liberation.""    
He is now accepted socially as a man, although he has received rejection from some. One childhood male friend said he would not consider him a man as he didn't have a penis.
Now dating a girl, Diaz de Tudanca is proud of his transgender identity and has taken part in a Madrid council awareness campaign to prevent hate crime, putting his face to a series of posters that appeared around the city's metro network.
""The hate and intolerance of others comes from ignorance about trans people,"" he says.

Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States, was killed in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.
After making numerous contradictory statements about Khashoggi's fate, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Turkey has previously said it was working with other countries on the Khashoggi investigation, and has accused Saudi Arabia of not fully cooperating to uncover the journalist's killing.
Cavusoglu said in a speech that some Western countries were trying to cover up Khashoggi's murder, adding that Turkey had made preparations to launch an international investigation on the matter, the state-owned Anadolu reported on Monday. 
""There are Western countries trying to cover this case up. I know the reasons. We know and see what sorts of deals are made. We see how those who spoke of freedom of press are now covering this up after seeing money,"" Anadolu quoted him as saying. 
""We, however, will go until the end. We made preparations for an international investigation in the coming days and we will take the necessary steps,"" he was cited as saying.
Despite a joint investigation with Saudi officials looking at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the consul's residence and several other locations, the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains are still unknown. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Khashoggi's killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership, but Riyadh has rejected accusations that the prince was involved.
Saudi prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects detained over the murder, which has caused international outrage and damaged the reputation of the 33-year old crown prince.

Saudi Arabia has come under heavy international pressure over the Khashoggi killing, including from the United States, its closest ally, whose Senate has voted for a resolution blaming the prince for the murder.

Hun Sen is on a three-day visit to China, his most important regional ally, and held bilateral talks with President Xi Jinping in Beijing in which he asked for more aid and investment in his Southeast Asian country's crucial textile industry.
Xi pledged the 2019-21 grant in response, Hun Sen's official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post said. The Chinese leader also promised to import 400,000 tonnes of rice from Cambodia, vowed to push bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2023 and encouraged more Chinese investment, the post said.
""The President said the relationship between China and Cambodia is very special, compared to other countries,"" Hun Sen's post said.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Xi told Hun Sen China wanted to strengthen political, economic and security cooperation with Cambodia and increase China-Cambodia coordination at the United Nations and within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
The two sides should hasten links between China's Belt and Road plan and Cambodia's development strategy, Xi said. The statement made no mention of the financial aid.
China has already poured billions of dollars in development assistance and loans into Cambodia through Xi's Belt and Road initiative, which aims to bolster land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
Some Western governments have accused China of pulling countries into a debt trap with the initiative, an accusation China has denied. 
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all seats in a general election in July after the Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in 2017 at the government's request.
The European Union condemned the election as not credible and threatened to strip Cambodia of its Everything but Arms status because of the crackdown on the opposition, media and civil society groups before the election.

It imposed tariffs on rice from Cambodia last week for the next three years to curb a surge in imports it said had damaged EU producers.

Macau police and state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday that a criminal gang had illegally brought credit card point-of-sale terminals from the mainland into Macau's casinos for gamblers to get cash out.
Macau is the world's biggest gambling hub.
The bust comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping announced on Monday that the country must be on guard against ""black swan"" risks while fending off ""grey rhino"" events, adding that the economy faces deep and complicated changes. 
Xi's warning and the ensuing crackdown came after data showed the economy posted the slowest growth in 28 years last year, hurt by faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs.Illegal point of sale terminals in Macau, a Chinese territory, have been a key method for many mainland Chinese to circumvent cash withdrawal limits of 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a day. They either use that money to gamble or transfer it abroad. 
Macau authorities have been cracking down on the scheme over the past year and instructed financial institutions to tackle the illegal use of UnionPay cards to evade exchange controls. 
Macau's gambling industry has revenues of around $3 billion a month.
Through the joint investigation, Beijing and Macau police raided their respective cities as well as Hebei, Hubei and Guangdong. They seized 32 illegal converted point of sale terminals as well bank cards and computers.
Police said the criminal group started operations in 2016, recruiting mainlanders to come to the Chinese special administrative region. The group had opened 5 accounts in a casinos' VIP room as a source of funds. The statements did not identify which casino or VIP room were involved.

LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - Northern Ireland police said the three security alerts they were examining in Londonderry on Monday have ended after the department confirmed the incidents, including one where they carried out a controlled explosion, to be hoaxes.
Police had carried out a controlled explosion on a vehicle on Monday that was hijacked by masked men in Londonderry and examined two other abandoned vans, two days after a car bomb had exploded in the city.
There was a large bang and black smoke from the first van after an army bomb disposal robot entered. Police said the van had been hijacked by three masked men who threw an object in the back before abandoning it on a residential street.
""We can confirm that all three alerts are hoaxes, however, we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community,"" police said https://twitter.com/PSNIDCSDistrict/status/1087520231327784960 early on Tuesday.
The department's statement on Twitter did not provide much details.
Officers had evacuated homes and cordoned off both areas as they inspected the vehicles. 
People have now returned to their respective homes. 
A  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) postal van was hijacked nearby later on Monday by four masked men, one of whom was reported to have a gun, police said. A third vehicle, which a Reuters witness identified as an Asda supermarket delivery van, was abandoned in another part of the city a few hours later.
There had also been an attempted hijacking of a local bus elsewhere, police said.
No one was injured in the blast outside a court on Saturday, but the incident highlighted the threat still posed by militant groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province.
The blast came at a time when police in Northern Ireland and European Union member Ireland have warned that a return to a hard border between the two after Brexit, complete with customs and other checks, could be a target for militants.
However, neither Britain's Northern Ireland minister, Karen Bradley, nor the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they saw any links between Brexit and the incidents in the province's second-largest city, which lies close to the border with Ireland. 
""We are not picking up any information that indicates that anybody wants to engage in violence in relation to the Brexit issue, certainly not at this point,"" PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told Irish broadcaster RTE.
FIFTH MAN DETAINED
Bradley said the threat level in Northern Ireland would remain at ""severe,"" where it has stood since 2009 when two British soldiers and a policeman were killed in the worst attacks in the province for over a decade.
""Although there has been a reduction in the overall number of national security attacks in recent years, vigilance in the face of this continuing threat remains essential,"" she told Britain's parliament in London.
A fifth man, aged 50, was arrested on Monday in relation to Saturday's attack under the Terrorism Act. The four other men detained earlier in connection with the incident were released without charge, police said.
There were no details from police on who may have been behind the hijackings in Londonderry, also known as Derry, particularly among Catholics to show their resistance to British rule. 
The main focus of the car bomb investigation is the New IRA - one of a small number of groups opposed to the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
This mostly ended a conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and predominantly Catholic nationalists, who want a united Ireland, in which some 3,600 people had died.
The New IRA was formed in 2012 after three of the four main militant nationalist groups merged. It was the first time since the peace deal that most of the disparate nationalist groups still intent on violence had come together under one leadership.

""It's an organization that has evolved over recent years,"" the PSNI's Hamilton said. ""They are a smallish grouping and they have a different presence in different parts of the province, but they remain committed to the aims of the violent dissident republican groups that we know exist here.""

The Oct. 29 crash, which killed all those on board, was the world's first of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018.
The contents of the jet's second black box, which were recovered from the Java Sea north of the capital, Jakarta, on Jan. 14, could provide a detailed account of the last actions of the pilots.
The recording needs to be filtered first due to ""background sounds"" hindering the transcription, said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the chief of the transportation safety committee (KNKT).
""It might take one or two weeks because it was noisy inside (the cockpit),"" he told Reuters. The transcription would not be made public until KNKT's final report is released ""between August to September"", he said.
Under international rules, a final crash report is due within 12 months if that is possible.
Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off from Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
The preliminary report released by KNKT in November focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the response of a Boeing anti-stall system and a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a cause for the crash.

Lion Air has faced scrutiny over its maintenance and training standards since the crash. Relatives of victims have filed at least three lawsuits against Boeing.

Last week, President Joko Widodo said Bashir, 81, would be granted early release on humanitarian grounds, citing his old age and poor health. A legal adviser to Widodo said the cleric would be given unconditional release. 
On Monday, Wiranto, the chief security minister, said the government was reviewing the unconditional release.
""The president has ordered related officials to immediately conduct a deeper and more comprehensive examination to respond to the request,"" the minister, who uses one name, like many Indonesians, said in a statement.
He added that authorities were ""weighing up aspects like the Pancasila"", the secular state ideology to which every convict is required to pledge allegiance, but which Bashir has repeatedly refused to acknowledge.
Bashir, who is considered the spiritual leader of the Islamist group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), was convicted under anti-terrorism laws in 2010 for links to militant training camps in the province of Aceh, on the island of Sumatra, and jailed for 15 years. (reut.rs/1qNBwvC)
Although linked to the Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people, Bashir was not convicted for them. Many Australians were among the dead, however, and Canberra has urged against leniency for Bashir.
""We have been very clear about the need to ensure that as part of our joint counter-terrorism efforts … that Abu Bakar Bashir would not be in any position or in anyway able to influence or incite anything,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Cairns in northeastern Queensland on Monday.
The Bali attack spurred Indonesia to set up its elite anti-terror unit Densus 88 or Detachment 88, which received funds and training from Australia and the United States.
Criticism of Bashir's early release also came from the opposition party, Gerindra, with media quoting a senior party official as saying the release would be a ""political maneuver"" to gain Islamists' votes.

The Jakarta Post newspaper said Widodo's decision was ""poorly timed, legally flawed and insensitive.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of 20 undeclared ballistic missile operating bases in North Korea serves as a missile headquarters, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published on Monday.
""The Sino-ri missile operating base and the Nodong missiles deployed at this location fit into North Korea's presumed nuclear military strategy by providing an operational-level nuclear or conventional first strike capability,"" said the report co-authored by analyst Victor Cha.
The discovery of an undeclared missile headquarters comes three days after U.S. President Donald Trump said he ""looks forward"" to another summit to discuss denuclearization with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in late February. 
Kim vowed to work toward denuclearization at his first summit with Trump in June, but there has since been little concrete progress. 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CSIS, which last reported on the 20 missile bases in November, said the Sino-ri base has never been declared by North Korea and as a result ""does not appear to be the subject of denuclearization negotiations."" 
The report said that missile operating bases would presumably be subject to declaration, verification, and dismantlement in any nuclear deal. 
""The North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don't disclose,"" said Cha.
""It looks like they're playing a game. They're still going to have all this operational capability,"" even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear sites. 
Located 132 miles (212 km) north of the demilitarized zone, the Sino-ri complex is a seven-square-mile (18-square-km) base that plays a key role in developing ballistic missiles capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, and even the U.S. territory of Guam in the Western Pacific, the report said.
It houses a regiment-sized unit equipped with Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missiles, the report added.
Satellite images of the base from Dec. 27, 2018 show an entrance to an underground bunker, reinforced shelters and a headquarters, the report said.
In South Korea, the Sino-ri facility has long been known as one of the bases housing the Nodong, also called the Rodong, a medium-range missile based on Soviet-era Scud technology that the North began deploying in the mid-1990s.

The corpse of Rafael Murua Manriquez, 34, was found late Sunday afternoon by the side of a road between the towns of Santa Rosalia and San Ignacio in the state of Baja California Sur, the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Murua's body had wounds in the thorax, state prosecutors said, without giving more detail on the lesions.
According to the advocacy group Article 19, Murua was director of a community radio station in the state and had been in a program affording protection to journalists at risk since 2017.
The journalist's death was the second to occur since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office on Dec. 1.
Article 19, which defends freedom of expression and access to information, has documented the murder of 122 journalists in Mexico since 2000. Murders in Mexico jumped by a third to more than 33,000 last year.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>","As Taliban talks gather pace, Afghan women fear turning back clock","By Charlotte Greenfield
KABUL (Reuters) - Eighteen years ago, at the height of the Taliban's power in Afghanistan, Roshan Mashal secretly taught her daughters to read and write alongside a dozen local girls who smuggled school books to her house in potato sacks.
Mashal's daughters have since gained university degrees in economics and medicine. But she now fears the looming prospect that the hardline Islamist group, whose rule barred women from education, could once again become part of the government.
""They say they have changed, but I have concerns,"" she said in an interview in her office in Kabul. ""There is no trust ... we don't want peace to come with women losing all the achievements of the last 17 years.""
As talks to end Afghanistan's long war pick up momentum, women such as Mashal fear the freedoms eked out since U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001 are about to slide backwards, and complain their voices are being sidelined.
An aide to Rula Ghani, the wife of Afghanistan's president, said the first lady had launched a survey of women in 34 provinces in a bid to amplify their voices in the peace process, with a report summarizing their views slated for February.
""The war was started by men, the war will be ended by men,"" said the aide. ""But it's the women and children who suffer the most and they have a right to define peace.""
Almost two decades of war have implicated both sides in the suffering of women. The United Nations last year expressed alarm at the increased use of air strikes by U.S. and Afghan forces, which caused a rising death toll among women and children.
CHANGED TIMES
Afghanistan is still not an easy place to be a woman, with forced marriages, domestic violence and high maternal mortality rates prevalent nationwide, and particularly in rural areas, according to gender equality advocates.
But access to public life has improved, especially in cities such as the capital Kabul, where many women work outside the home and more than a quarter of the parliament is female.
But women lawmakers and some foreign diplomats fear enshrining gender equality may take a backseat in any peace deal to the intense international focus on ending fighting and eliminating the country's potential as a haven for militants to launch attacks overseas.
""That is the threshold. The question is how much they will accept the position of women deteriorating in the process,"" said a senior Western diplomat in Kabul whose country funds projects to empower women. ""There may be some backsliding, but hopefully not all the way back."" 
Between 1996 and 2001, under the Taliban government that called itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, women were banned from work, required to wear the full-length burqa that covered their faces, and not allowed to leave the house without a male relative.
The Taliban say they have changed, and that they would allow women to be educated, though they say schools should be segregated by gender and women required to wear loose clothing.
""We want Afghanistan to move forward with its present achievements and developments. But there are some reforms and changes the Emirate will struggle for,"" spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told Reuters last month.
That is not enough to assuage the fears of women such as Karima Rahimyaar. She is the main provider for her family after her first husband was shot and killed by the Taliban in Kunduz province in 1996 and her second was injured and left unable to work after being imprisoned by them around three year ago. 
She regularly comforts her university-aged daughters, who feel sick when they hear gunshots or mention of the Taliban.
""It is very difficult for me,"" she said. 
Like many Afghans, she is desperate for peace and wants an end to the near-daily attacks across the country, which claimed the life of her 32-year-old son, a police officer, in 2016.
But not, she says, at the expense of women's rights.
""If there are no agreements and commitments, women will be inside the home and they will be deprived of everything,"" she said. 
FIGHTING FOR A VOICE
Wazhma Frogh, a member of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, tasked with negotiating with the Taliban, said that she and the 11 other female members of the group had to fight to have their perspective heard.
""To get access is difficult,"" she said, saying that at times women had to raise their voices in meetings to avoid being ignored and that gatherings were sometimes held late at night in venues women did not feel comfortable traveling to.
Though the Taliban is refusing to include the Afghan government in formal talks, Frogh and other members have informally met with the insurgent group and with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.
Meanwhile young women such as Zuhal Babakarkhil, one of the fast-growing segment of the population who have reached adulthood since the fall of the Taliban, say Afghan society has changed.
""In Afghanistan the women are no more the women from 20 years back,"" said the 28-year-old, who was in her first year of school when the Taliban took power and whose family fled overseas. 
She now lives in Kabul, plays cricket and promotes higher education among girls. She says that social media such as Whatsapp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gives women access to organizing networks at home and abroad that would be tough to curtail. 
She said she has no intention to leave Afghanistan, despite her worries about the Taliban returning.

""We did it before ... but certainly this is not the way, to escape anymore,"" she said. ""We are not leaving our home country. We will definitely stand up for our rights.""

There was no immediate tsunami warning or reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which hit at a depth of 25 km (16 miles) about 219 km (136 miles) south of Raba in the east of Sumbawa, which forms part of West Nusa Tenggara province.

Investigators opened to 33,341 murder probes compared with the previous year's record of 25,036, according to information from the Interior Ministry published on Sunday.
Mexico has struggled with years of violence as the government has battled brutal drug cartels, often by taking out their leaders. That has resulted in fragmentation of gangs and increasingly vicious internecine fighting.
The complexity of fighting criminal groups is a major test for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who assumed office in December, vowing to try a different approach to his predecessor.
Former President Enrique Pena Nieto presided over a 40 percent rise in murder investigations across his six-year mandate from his first full year in office in 2013.
Of Mexico's 32 regions, the central state of Guanajuato registered the highest number of murder probes opened in 2018, at 3,290, more than three times as many murder probes as the 1,084 investigations opened in 2017.
Guanajuato has been hit by bloody turf wars among gangs battling for control of a lucrative market for stolen fuel.
The data showed 861 cases of murders of women in 2018 compared with 735 in 2017.

Mexico's national statistics office (INEGI) also calculated a record number of homicides in 2017, at 31,174 murders, or 25 per 100,000, using other methodologies. INEGI has yet to present its data for violent crime in 2018.

Sudan has been shaken by near-daily demonstrations for over a month. They were set off by a worsening economic crisis, but quickly turned into growing calls for an end to President Omar al-Bashir's three-decade rule.
The family of 24-year-old trainee engineer Alfateh Omar al-Nemeir told Reuters he had died ""affected by his bullet wound to the eye (sustained) during his participation in the peaceful demonstration in the Burri neighborhood last Thursday.""
An opposition-linked doctors' committee had said a child and a doctor were shot dead during protests on Jan. 17 in Burri, a neighborhood in the capital Khartoum, across the Nile from Omdurman.
A police spokesman denied a child had died and said no live fire had been used since the protests began. Bashir blamed the doctor's death on ""infiltrators"".
A 60-year-old man also died from a gunshot wound sustained in Burri, and his funeral became a flashpoint for widening protests on Friday.
Sudan on Monday froze the credentials of two journalists who have covered the anti-government protests.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced on Monday a bill to set stiffer fines and jail time for serious violations of the country's environmental laws, marking a shift toward increasing environmental scrutiny in the world's top copper producer.
The initiative would make it a crime to mislead environmental inspectors or to obstruct the enforcement of environmental laws, center-right Pinera said in a speech announcing the legislation. 
Serious environmental infractions would be punished with as much as two months in jail, and fines of up to $70,000. Most environmental crimes in Chile are currently handled by civil or environmental tribunals, or through out-of-court settlements with regulators. 
""We're working to position Chile as an example on a global level in terms of environmental stewardship,"" Pinera told reporters.
Besides copper, Chile is a leading global producer of a wide array of fruits and vegetables, farmed salmon, lithium and renewable energy. Increasing scrutiny of large-scale projects by citizen groups and non-governmental organizations has spurred tougher oversight by government regulators in recent years.
Pinera's bill would also empower local and regional authorities to more closely supervise mitigation efforts of projects that have the potential to pose serious environmental threats.

The initiative would need to pass both chambers of Chile's Congress before becoming law.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria's main opposition candidate for president wants to overhaul the central bank by separating supervisory and monetary policy functions, and to transition the naira to a managed float, a spokesman for him said on Monday. 
Atiku Abubakar, a businessman who served as vice president between 1999 and 2007, is the main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari in the Feb. 16 election.
""Bankers are really conflicted when you put them in the role of regulators,"" Abubakar's spokesman Osita Chidoka told Reuters, adding the central bank had not divided sufficiently its supervisory and monetary policy functions as other countries do.
""The central bank is high on the list of agencies that will witness a restructuring to be sure that it is reflective of the dynamics of today's economy.""
Chidoka also said Abubakar did not think current governor Godwin Emefiele was best placed to continue at the helm given his past record supporting the government. 
""He wasn't independent,"" said Chidoka, who had just returned from a trip to Washington with Abubakar, of the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP).
""You really need a development mindset and an economist ... it doesn't have to be a banker, it has to be someone who thinks about the economy in a holistic way.""
Emefiele's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Emefiele imposed currency restrictions in 2015, defying bankers’ advice to float the naira and raise interest rates as some other oil exporters had done. 
His decisions were in line with current leader Buhari, a staunch opponent of letting the naira float freely. 
The currency restrictions saw investors cutting their exposure to Nigerian asset as the once promising emerging market was ejected from key bond indexes.
Chidoka also confirmed Abubakar planned to oversee the currency transition into a managed float that would give more flexibility but also reflected the fact that Nigeria's oil-dependent economy hugely depended on crude oil prices. 
""Nigeria cannot afford to keep the naira at 305 (to the dollar), creating a window for arbitrage. On the street it is 360 - a 55 naira difference."" 
Nigeria has a plethora of exchange rates against the U.S. currency and has been selling the dollar on the interbank market to boost liquidity after floating the naira for investors.
However, the official rate stood at around 307 to the dollar on Monday - a level it has been close to since late 2016, while black market currency dealers quoted the naira at 362.

Nigeria vies with South Africa's to be the largest economy on the continent, but has performed below par since 2016, when it suffered its first recession in 25 years.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador will ask Venezuelan migrants to present their criminal records upon entering, the country's vice president said on Monday, following the murder of a pregnant Ecuadorean woman by a Venezuelan man that triggered protests and acts of violence.
The Saturday killing in the northern city of Ibarra was the first reported murder committed by a Venezuelan immigrant in Ecuador since hundreds of thousands began arriving, fleeing an economic crisis. Ecuador estimates that 1.3 million Venezuelans entered last year, though many continue on to other countries.
""Without generalizing, but with a firm hand, today we must differentiate between Venezuelans who are fleeing Maduro's government and others who take advantage of the situation to commit crimes,"" Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner said, referring to Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Sonnenholzner added that Caracas has refused to provide Quito with information on its citizens seeking to enter Ecuador. Last year, Argentina eased entry requirements for Venezuelans given that many struggled to obtain documents, including their criminal background histories, on time.
The announcement comes after Ecuador's president, Lenin Moreno, over the weekend said he would create ""units"" to check Venezuelans' legal status ""in the streets, in the workplace, and at the border"" following the murder. 
That drew criticism from Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, who accused Ecuador of inciting ""a fascist persecution against Venezuelans in Ecuador"" and noted that Ecuadoreans living in Venezuela had never been discriminated against.
While Ecuador has called on its citizens to avoid violence against Venezuelans, representatives of Ecuador's Venezuelan community said migrants had suffered attacks and threats in the wake of the murder and Moreno's comments. 
Some Venezuelan women and children were assaulted in Ibarra's bus terminal as they waited to flee south to the capital Quito, said Febres Cordero of the Federation of Venezuelans Abroad.
""We are concerned about xenophobic acts that have taken place in various cities across the country,"" Cordero said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will warn that schemes in EU states to sell citizenship or residence to wealthy individuals could help foreign organized crime groups infiltrate the bloc and increase the risk of money laundering, corruption and tax evasion.
The warnings are included in a draft report, seen by Reuters, that is expected to be published on Wednesday by the European Union's executive.
Although individuals who purchase citizenship and residence in EU states can do it for legitimate reasons, the commission said the schemes posed ""risks of infiltration of non-EU organized crime groups in the economy, money laundering, corruption and tax evasion.""
Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria are the only members of the 28-nation EU which run schemes selling citizenship, while twenty states, including those three, sell residence permits.
In the three states rich foreigners can buy passports, which grant them unhindered access to most EU countries, for investments ranging between around 1 million and 2 million euros ($2.2 million).
The report said there were shortfalls among all three in checking the origins of wealth of individuals who purchased their citizenship. The countries also did not allow easy identification of those who bought their passports.
They also circumvented EU rules that require ""effective"" residence in an EU state before granting citizenship.
The Commission said that EU states' programs to sell national residence to foreigners posed similar risks as citizenship schemes.
Twenty EU states currently sell residence permits to foreign citizens. Residence is sold against investments that range between less than 15,000 euros ($17,000) in Croatia to over 5 million euros in Luxembourg and Slovakia, the report said.
The document raises doubts about several national schemes. The Portuguese program was criticized for granting residence to foreigners who stay in the country for just seven days a year, against EU rules that require ""continuity of presence"". Other countries do not require continuous presence.
Portugal also does not make checks on the origin of wealth and payments made by foreigners who get a residence there, posing a potential risk of money laundering.
The Commission said in the report it will set up a group of experts that will recommend by the end of the year measures to counter the risks caused by these schemes.

His death, aged 85, was announced on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by his son Jean.
Henri was said to harbor royal ambitions, but the movement to restore France's monarchy has progressively dwindled since the years leading up to World War Two, when it was viewed in some quarters as a credible threat to Republicanism.

The poll, by the Public Opinion Research Centre, found that trust in Putin had fallen to 33.4 percent, its lowest level since 2006.
The results do not pose an immediate problem for Putin who won a landslide election victory and a new six-year mandate in March last year, but could embolden would-be successors to begin what is likely to be a long game of jostling for position. 
Putin's overall approval rating, which is different from his trust rating, is still high at just over 60 percent.
His approval rating has slipped from its peak of nearly 90 percent amid dismay over falling household incomes and unpopular government moves to raise the retirement age and hike value added tax. 
Putin's trust rating hit a high of 71 percent in July 2015 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea the previous year.
On the eve of last year's presidential election, it stood at 55.3 percent. Since then, public trust in him has dropped sharply, falling to 38.3 percent three months later, ending 2018 at 36.5 percent.
Putin remains far more trusted than any other politician in Russia however, the same poll showed. 

The second and third most trusted politicians in the poll were Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who received trust ratings of 13.7 percent and 9.3 percent respectively.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's government accused the main opposition party of planning violence ahead of next month's election in a nation with a history of unrest and fraud allegations around votes. 
The opposition called it a ""ludicrous"" pretext for repression.
The Feb. 16 vote in Africa's top oil producer pits Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015, against main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president.
Reliable polls are hard to find in the nation of 190 million people, and analysts widely expect a tight race, partly because opposition stronghold states have seen a bigger increase in voter registration than ones where the ruling party is popular. 
""We have credible intelligence that armed bandits andBoko Haram insurgents have been mobilized to engage in massive attacks and other acts of violence in several states,"" Information Minister Lai Mohammed said, pointing the finger at Abubakar's People's Democratic Party (PDP).
Mohammed, who did not provide details of evidence, said the opposition wanted to create a constitutional crisis and trigger an interim government because it could not win the election. 
""It is imperative to state that the PDP finds the claims of Alhaji Lai Mohammed irresponsible and ludicrous. It is just a measure for building the ground for framing up and arrest of leading members,"" said the PDP in an emailed statement. 
In October, Buhari sought to reassure voters the election would be free and fair after the opposition and international observers raised concerns that a gubernatorial vote was marred by voter intimidation.
Security has become a campaign issue due to an uptick in attacks by Islamist insurgents in the northeast. 
Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram, the militant group from which it broke away in 2016, have both carried out attacks in the last few months. 
The PDP in its statement also urged the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure a free election.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday it had suppressed a small military revolt after a group of officers stole weapons and kidnapped several officials, as a video posted online showed a sergeant demanding the removal of President Nicolas Maduro.
The officers attacked a National Guard outpost in the Caracas neighborhood of Cotiza, a kilometer (0.6 mile) from the presidential Miraflores palace, where they met ""firm resistance,"" the government said in a statement. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots at about 3 a.m. (0700 GMT).
Protesters later burned trash and a car outside the outpost, where the officers were arrested, in a sign of growing tensions following Maduro's inauguration to a second term that governments around the world have called illegitimate.
Though the incident signals discontent within the armed forces, it appeared to involve only low-ranking officers with little capacity to force change in the hyperinflationary economy as many people suffer from shortages of food and medicine.
""The armed forces categorically reject this type of action, which is most certainly motivated by the dark interests of the extreme right,"" the government said in a statement read out on state television.
Maduro was inaugurated on Jan. 10 under an avalanche of criticism that his leadership was illegitimate following a 2018 election widely viewed as fraudulent, with countries around the world disavowing his government.
Opposition leaders and exiled dissidents have called on the armed forces to turn against Maduro, which the president has denounced as efforts to encourage a coup against him.
The opposition-controlled congress's head, Juan Guaido, said the uprising was a sign of the armed forces' discontent. Congress was committed to offering guarantees to officers who helped with ""the constitution's reconstitution,"" he said, though he did not want the military to fall into internal conflict.
""We want it to stand as one man on the side of the people, the constitution, and against the usurpation,"" he said on Twitter.
Venezuela's pro-government Supreme Court ruled on Monday that it did not recognize Guaido as head of congress and declared that all the body's actions were null and void. 
Guaido, who was elected to head Congress on Jan. 5, has said he is willing to replace Maduro as interim president if he has the support of the military, with the aim of then calling free elections. Congress declared Maduro an ""usurper"" last week.
Supreme Court Judge Juan Jose Mendoza asked the state prosecutor's office to determine whether the congress' leadership had committed crimes.
""YOU ASKED...HERE WE ARE""
In the videos that circulated on Twitter, a group of armed soldiers stood in darkness apparently at the Cotiza outpost while their leader addressed the camera and called for Venezuelans to support their revolt. 
""You all asked that we take to the streets to defend the constitution. Here we are. Here we have the troops. It's today when the people come out to support us,"" said the man in the video, who identified himself as Luis Bandres.
The government said an unspecified number of officers took two vehicles from a police station in the western Macarao district before driving across the city to a barracks in the eastern Petare slum, where they stole an arms cache and kidnapped four officials.
After they attacked the Cotiza outpost, security forces surrounded them. In response, several dozen residents barricaded streets and set fire to rubbish as they chanted ""Don't hand yourself in,"" according to Reuters witnesses. Troops fired tear gas to disperse them.
""These soldiers are right to rise up. We need a political change, because we don't have any water or electricity,"" said Angel Rivas, a 49-year-old laborer at the protest.
The United States and many Latin American nations say Maduro has become a dictator whose failed state-led policies have plunged Venezuela into its worst ever economic crisis, with inflation approaching 2 million percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has indicated its support for Guaido and, according to people familiar with the matter, is considering recognizing him as Venezuela's legitimate president.

Maduro says a U.S.-directed ""economic war"" is trying to force him from power.

They were seen helping pave the way towards a second summit planned for next month between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""Constructive talks have been held covering issues concerning developments on the Korean peninsula, including confidence building, economic development and long-term engagement,"" a ministry spokesman said. 
Trump is due to meet Kim in late February but will maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang, a White House spokeswoman said on Friday.
That announcement coincided with the visit to Washington of former North Korean spy chief Kim Yong Chol and hinted at movement in a denuclearization effort that has stalled since a landmark first meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader last year.
A diplomatic source said the Swedish round-table conference, held on the outskirts of Stockholm over the weekend and concluded on Monday, had touched on the planned summit while bilateral talks had also been held on the sidelines.
""Different mechanisms for regional security have been discussed, that issue was something to which a lot of time was devoted,"" the source said.
North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun and South Korean negotiator Lee Do-hoon took part.
Sweden serves as ""protecting power"" in North Korea for the United States, which has no representation in Pyongyang, and also held talks with North Korean officials last year in the lead-up to the first Trump-Kim summit.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's government is proposing regulations including vetting new songs in a move critics say is aimed at discouraging negative comments about the authorities who are rattled by the popularity of pop star Bobi Wine.
The 36-year-old singer turned opposition politician, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has amassed a large following among the country's disillusioned youths for the biting criticism of the government contained in his lyrics.
In power since 1986, President Yoweri Museveni, 74, is widely expected to seek re-election at the next polls in 2021.
Peace Mutuuzo, junior minister for gender, labor and social development, told Reuters in an interview the new regulations to govern the music and entertainment industry were already drafted and expected to be passed by cabinet by March. 
Among the regulations are a range of restrictions including requiring artists to submit lyrics for songs and scripts for film and stage performances to authorities to be vetted. 
Content deemed to contain offensive language, to be lewd or to copy someone else's work, will be censured, the minister said. Musicians will also have to seek government permission to perform outside Uganda.
""We cannot continue condoning as a country abusive language. This is one thing we know has been happening within the creative industry. People compose songs to abuse others,"" Mutuuzo said. 
Musicians and other artists will also have to register with the government and obtain a practicing license which can be revoked for a range of violations. 
""Any artist or entertainer who is in gross breach of the guidelines shall have his/her certificate revoked,"" a copy of the proposed regulations seen by Reuters reads.
Museveni's critics say he has become increasingly intolerant of dissent as his support has waned, with security forces often putting down opposition rallies and protests with teargas, beatings and detentions.
John Segawa, an actor and film director, told Reuters the new rules were meant to intimidate artists critical of the government. 
""Where is our right to free expression guaranteed in the constitution if we need to submit our works for approval?,"" he said.
Authorities have recently canceled several planned performances by Bobi Wine, who has accused the government of seeking to cut him off from a key source of income as retribution for his anti-government stance. 

Uganda human rights lawyer Ladislas Rwakafuzi described the regulations as ""a punishing political move"" to send a message to Bobi Wine and other critical voices in the entertainment industry.

Ahmed al-Amari, who previously served as a dean at Islamic University in Medina, was transferred to a government hospital earlier this month after suffering a brain hemorrhage, London-based rights group ALQST and activists said late on Sunday. 
Amari's son, Abdullah, confirmed the death on Twitter and said funeral prayers would be held on Monday afternoon.
There was no immediate comment from the Saudi authorities.
Amari, a Sunni Muslim, was arrested in August when security forces raided his home and then held in solitary confinement, according to the activists.
He and some others detained at the same time are believed to be close to influential religious scholar Safar al-Hawali, who was arrested in July 2018 after publishing a book critical of the Saudi royal family. 
Saudi Arabia has witnessed a crackdown on dissent, including the arrest and alleged torture of women activists as well as liberal intellectuals and Islamist activists, even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has enacted some high-profile social and economic reforms.
The Gulf Arab state, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, says it does not have political prisoners and denies torture allegations. Officials have said monitoring of activists is needed to ensure social stability.
The murder of Khashoggi, a longtime royal insider who had become a critic of the crown prince, inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate last October sparked a global outcry, tarnishing the crown prince's reputation and focusing attention on the treatment of activists and the war in Yemen.

The UAE pardoned Hedges from a life sentence in November after showing a video of him purportedly confessing to being a member of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and researching which military systems the UAE was buying.
In the video, which was sometimes inaudible and shown with subtitles that could not be independently verified, Hedges appeared to say he approached sources as a doctoral student. Britain has denied he was a spy and welcomed his pardon.
""The confession tape, from my understanding, because I haven't seen it, (is) an amalgamation or it's cut and edited from the many months of my detention as well as scenes from court under duress, under threats of torture and psychological pressure,"" Hedges told Reuters in an interview in New York.
""There was no other option but to confess.""
Asked about Hedges's accusations, a UAE official said the academic had not been subjected to any physical or psychological mistreatment during his detention, and denied that the taped confession had been edited.
""The fact remains that he (Hedges) was a part-time academic, part-time businessman and full-time spy,"" said Jaber Al Lamki, executive director of Strategic and Media Communications at the UAE's National Media Council. 
Hedges, 31, a doctoral student at Durham University, was arrested on May 5 at Dubai airport after a two-week research visit. He was kept in solitary confinement for more than five months and the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research.
Hedges said the UAE authorities had asked him to ""steal documents and information from the UK Foreign Office"" and that this shocked him.
Lamki denied that the UAE authorities had done any such thing, describing the allegation as ""absolute nonsense"".
Hedges's research focused on sensitive topics in the UAE such as security structures, tribalism and the consolidation of political power in Abu Dhabi.
His family have described him as a dedicated researcher who fell foul of the UAE's security and justice system. The UAE said he was a British spy who was given a fair trial for grave espionage offences.

Hedges, who was in New York with his wife Daniela Tejada, who had campaigned hard for his release, said he was now receiving psychiatric help to recover from his ordeal and expected the process to take years.

(Reuters) - Winter winds brought extreme cold and ice-slicked roads to the Midwestern and Eastern United States on Monday, with the U.S. Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday and an ongoing government shutdown allowing many to heed official advice to stay indoors.
The arctic blast of frigid air has followed a January storm that dumped more than a foot (30 cm) of snow and sleet across the Northeast, which started melting Sunday.
In a Chicago suburb, a 12-year-old girl died after a snow fort she had built after church on Sunday collapsed on her, according to the Arlington Heights Police Department. A 9-year-old girl she was playing with was treated for hypothermia after being dug out of the snow and was expected to survive, police said.
Temperatures fell to single-digits Fahrenheit (about -20 C) from New York City to Boston and through northern New England and froze melting snow late on Sunday and early Monday, said Marc Chenard at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Winds up to 30 to 40 miles per hour (48-64 kph) added possibly deadly wind chill.
""This is definitely dangerous, life-and-death kind of weather happening,"" Chenard said. ""Minnesota and Wisconsin will see temperatures in the negative 20s.""
""Boston will be just 3 degrees (Fahrenheit) this morning, with wind chills of minus 12 or more,"" he said. ""New York City and D.C. will be in that same range, maybe hitting the teens later today. It'll be record or near-record cold.""
The NWS issued wind-chill advisories and warnings for more than 10 states, from North Dakota and to East Coast metropolitan centers.
High temperatures for Monday are forecast at 17 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) for New York City and 12 F (minus 11 C) for Boston.
Many Americans had the day off work on Monday, either because of the holiday or because they are among the furloughed federal government workers who find themselves in the longest shutdown in U.S. history, caused by an impasse over funding U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to build more barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.
More than 7,500 flights were delayed, mostly in New York and New England, according to FlightAware.com, down from more than 14,000 on Sunday.

Tuesday's weather will be only slightly warmer, Chenard said, with temperatures reaching the low 20s Fahrenheit in the Northeast.

The toddler, Julen, fell down the shaft as his family walked through a private estate in Totalan, Malaga on Jan. 13. There have been no signs of life since.
Miners have been drilling day and night to create a parallel shaft, hoping they will be able to cut across by Tuesday to find the child.
Work slowed on Sunday after the drill bit hit hard rock and officials said there was a risk of more collapses as they carved out the horizontal passage.
""The most dangerous part, the most delicate part, still remains to be done,"" mining engineer Juan Lopez Escobar told Canal Sur. 
""It is a complicated job where lives will be at risk, but they have practiced that, and they are the best,"" he added. 
Rescuers found that the borehole - 100 meters (300 feet) deep and just 25 cm (10 inches) wide - was blocked with earth, raising fears that soil had collapsed onto the child.
""We're at 53 meters, and we're just another seven meters away (from where) we start the next job of creating the chamber,"" Angel Vidal, the lead engineer overseeing the work, told reporters.
Spanish miners and engineers have been joined by workers from a Swedish firm who helped locate 33 Chilean miners rescued after 69 days underground more than seven years ago. 
Children and families have joined candlelight vigils across Spain in support of the missing boy.

El Pais reported that his parents suffered another tragedy in 2017 when their three-year-old son died suddenly after suffering a cardiac arrest while walking along a beach.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",African leaders back Congo president-elect after contested poll,"By Stanis Bujakera
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's president elect Felix Tshisekedi received a chorus of congratulations from African leaders on Sunday and Monday in a growing sign that his disputed election win will not be questioned internationally. 
Regional support is crucial for Tshisekedi after a disorganized election on Dec. 30 that runner-up candidate Martin Fayulu says was rigged and that Congo's Catholic Church contested. Many worry that outgoing president Joseph Kabila will continue to hold sway, limiting Tshisekedi's power.
The new president will be the first to take power through an election since Congo's independence in 1960, when Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was toppled in a coup after less than three months in office. Congolese and their neighbors are anxious that the process remain peaceful in a country that has drawn regional armies into its civil wars over the decades.
International allies and neighbors had struggled to come to a consensus after the poll that observers said was marred by a series of irregularities including malfunctioning voting machines and polling stations that opened late or closed early. 
In a surprise statement last week, the African Union asked for the final results to be postponed because of ""serious doubts"" over the conduct of the election, raising fears that a protracted dispute could fan unrest in the volatile country of 80 million people. 
But since the Constitutional Court early on Sunday rejected Fayulu's complaint and backed Tshisekedi's victory, opposition to the vote appears to have softened. Tshisekedi is expected to be sworn in on Jan. 24.
CONGRATULATIONS
South African president Cyril Ramaphosa congratulated Tshisekedi on Monday and in a statement ""called on all parties and all stakeholders in the DRC to respect the decision of the Constitutional Court"". 
The presidents of Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi congratulated Tshisekedi in a series of Tweets on Sunday, echoing the Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community (SADC) - a bloc that includes South Africa and Angola - which also called for the transition of power to remain peaceful, backing off from earlier calls for a recount.
The AU has yet to comment since it noted the court's decision. It postponed a visit by a high-level delegation to Kinshasa that had been scheduled for Monday.
Fayulu says Tshisekedi and outgoing President Joseph Kabila made a deal to cheat him out of a more than 60-percent win - an accusation they both deny.
On Monday he asked African leaders to ""respect the sovereign decision of the Congolese people who elected me president"".
""Last week we had seen a risk of foreign intervention, if the heads of neighboring states backed Mr Fayulu in a protracted dispute. Now that most of them have accepted Mr Tshisekedi’s win, the risk looks somewhat lower,"" said research firm NKC African Economics in a statement on Monday. 
Police in the capital Kinshasa blocked access to the headquarters of a party in Fayulu's Lamuka coalition, where he had intended to gather supporters and protest against the confirmation of Tshisekedi's victory.
Lamuka spokeswoman Eve Bazaiba told Reuters the building had been besieged and protesters dispersed, forcing Fayulu to abandon his plans.
Some Congolese hoped Fayulu would accept defeat in the interest of peace. 
""He (Fayulu) needs to let it go. Going to the Constitutional Court and all that is just creating problems and for me it's a waste of time,"" said Kinshasa resident Patricia Mokabi.
""We are all Congolese, we are together whether it is Felix or Fayulu, they can work together.""
Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders told local media he would have preferred the process to be more transparent, and the verification of results to be more open.
Western countries also initially expressed doubt about the preliminary vote count. Since Tshisekedi's victory was confirmed, their responses have been more muted than those of countries in the region. 
France said on Monday it had ""taken note"" of Tshisekedi's victory and that it would be sending its ambassador to the swearing in ceremony. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said at a press conference that the EU would take a position after meeting with the AU on Monday.

Russia's foreign ministry noted the historical importance of the electoral transfer of power: ""We consider these elections a milestone in the political life of the DRC.""

During white rule, Zuma was imprisoned for 10 years with Nelson Mandela on Robben Island. Later he went into exile, before returning after the ban on the now ruling African National Congress was lifted in 1990.
The 76-year-old, who was forced to resign as president in February 2018 after nine years beset by corruption scandals and economic stagnation, beat several contenders to record the songs for the project led by a Durban-based municipality, including emerging artists and established musicians.
Zuma has regularly broken into his trademark anti-apartheid song ""umshini wami"" or ""bring me my machine gun"" after speaking at rallies or after court appearances.
""The former president ... is into the habit of singing these songs and, at times, when he sings them, even the activists today can't follow him because these songs were new to them,"" Thembinkosi Ngcobo, head of the eThekwini Municipality's Parks, Recreation and Culture department, said.
Music played a central role in the struggle for liberation from colonial rule and the apartheid regime. It was used to protest at racial segregation and raise awareness, generating support for the movement against apartheid, which ended in 1994.
However, opposition party the Democratic Alliance, has said choosing Zuma for the project ""is blatant patronage where the people's money will be used to finance the former president's lifestyle"".
In an interview with eNCA news channel this month, Ngcobo said he was not expecting Zuma to be paid and that the former president had not asked for anything in return.
Zuma's office declined to comment, referring questions to the parks department, until the details were finalised. He has always denied corruption allegations leveled against him. 
The eThekwini project is aimed at preserving the history and role such liberation songs played in the anti-apartheid movement, Ngcobo said.
""There is about 80 years, 90 years of the whole liberation struggle history that we lost because these songs were never kept,"" he told Reuters.

GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia has recognized the existence of a cruise missile system that has prompted Washington to say it will quit the 1987 INF disarmament treaty, but has denied that it violates the pact, U.S. officials and NATO diplomats said on Monday.
Two weeks before the planned U.S. withdrawal from the treaty, which keeps nuclear-capable missiles out of Europe, Washington's disarmament ambassador in Geneva said there was still time for Russia to destroy the system.
But after a session of the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament, Russian diplomat Alexander Deyneko told Reuters: ""We shall not yield to any ultimatums like to liquidate or to eliminate (a) missile that doesn't fall within the range of the treaty prohibitions.""
Russia had denied developing what U.S. intelligence calls the SSC-8/9M729 cruise missile system.
However, NATO diplomats said Moscow did now recognize its existence, but argued that its range was within the 500-km limit set by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. 
U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood said the system was a ""potent and direct threat to Europe and Asia"" as it had a range of 500 to 1,500 km (310-930 miles), contravening a treaty that is designed to prevent attacks at short notice.
""Russia must verifiably destroy all SSC-8 missiles, launchers and associated equipment in order to come back into compliance with the INF Treaty,"" Wood said.
""Unfortunately, the United States increasingly finds that Russia cannot be trusted to comply with its arms control obligations and that its coercive and malign actions around the globe have increased tensions.""
After a meeting with Russian officials in Geneva last week, the United States said Moscow's offer to save the treaty, negotiated by U.S. president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, was not genuine because it could not be verified. 
The impasse sets the stage for U.S. President Donald Trump to fulfill his threat to start withdrawing from the pact on Feb. 2, potentially allowing Washington to develop its own medium-range missiles. 
The United States will still have six months to formally complete its withdrawal, however.
The U.S.-led NATO alliance said it had not given up on bringing Russia back into compliance. NATO's 29 ambassadors will hold a special NATO-Russia Council with Moscow's acting envoy to the alliance, Yuri Gorlach, in Brussels on Friday.

NATO diplomats told Reuters that European members of the alliance led by Germany hoped Washington would make a final push to convince the Kremlin to come into line, or possibly to renegotiate the INF to include China.

""Because of recent rainfall in the area, part of the hill nearby collapsed and 14 miners who were getting ready for work were buried by land,"" Fred Mufuruke, governor of Eastern province, said.
The mining site is owned by the Rwandan business of Britain's Piran Resources, John Kanyangira, the director of mining inspection at Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RBM), said.
It was an open mining site and a nearby hill collapsed, burying seven men and seven women, he told Reuters.
Kanyangira said 81 people died last year in mining accidents.
He said Rwanda's mining industry, quarrying excluded, employs 43,000 people.
Piran Resources has a 25-year mining license in eastern Rwanda for two concessions.
Piran Resources is part of Pella Resources, an Africa-focused natural resource and energy group.
Last month, at another mining site in the southern part of Rwanda, five miners were trapped underground when the site collapsed. Soldiers and member of the public dug them out alive after nearly two days.
Small-scale mining in Rwanda's hilly landscape has led to landslides and mine collapses.
Earnings from Rwanda's mineral exports more than doubled to $373-million in 2017 up from $166-million a year before.
The government says revenues are expected to climb to $600 million in this year.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.
""We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,"" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military check point and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.
Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.
Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.
A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.
""I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,"" the former provincial official said.
Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.
""Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,"" said Hotak, adding that ""the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces."" 
""The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,"" he said.
Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.
Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures was not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.
""I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,"" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.
A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.
Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.
President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the ""enemies of the country"" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. ""They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.""
In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.
Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamic militant group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.

Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.

He Jiankui said in November that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born that month, sparking an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
Hundreds of Chinese and international scientists condemned He and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was unethical.
Chinese authorities also denounced He and issued a temporary halt to research activities involving the editing of human genes.
He had ""deliberately evaded oversight"" with the intent of creating a gene-edited baby ""for the purpose of reproduction"", according to the initial findings of an investigating team set up by the Health Commission of China in southern Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency reported.
He had raised funds himself and privately organized a team of people to carry out the procedure in order to ""seek personal fame and profit"", Xinhua said, adding that he had forged ethical review papers in order to enlist volunteers for the procedure.
The safety and efficacy of the technologies He used are unreliable and creating gene-edited babies for reproduction is banned by national decree, the report said.
The Southern (NYSE:SO) University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in the city of Shenzhen, said in a statement on its website that He had been fired.

The university added the decision came after a preliminary investigation by the Guangdong Province Investigation Task Force.
Neither He nor a representative could be reached for comment on Monday. He defended his actions at a conference in Hong Kong in November, saying that he was ""proud"" of what he had done and that gene editing would help protect the girls from being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
International experts in genetic science said they hoped that Monday's report was only the initial result of investigations into He and that more action would be taken.
""The report will hopefully set an example with appropriate legal and punitive actions to reassure the public and scientific community,"" said Yalda Jamshidi, a genomics expert at Britain's University of London.
He's announcement sparked a debate among Chinese legal scholars over which laws He had technically broken by carrying out the procedure, as well as whether he could be held criminally responsible or not.
Many scholars pointed to a 2003 guideline that bans altered human embryos from being implanted for the purpose of reproduction, and says altered embryos cannot be developed for more than 14 days.
The case files of those involved who are suspected of committing crimes have been sent to the ministry of public security, an unnamed spokesperson for the investigation team was quoted by Xinhua as saying.

Helen O'Neill, a reproductive science expert at University College London, said she was concerned that the report gave ""no further clarification on what measures will be taken to prevent this happening in future, nor what will be done as punishment"".

NEW DELHI/KOCHI (Reuters) - A fishing boat that could contain more than 100 Indian migrants may be heading to New Zealand, Indian police said on Monday. 
The boat, which is carrying people from the Indian capital New Delhi and the southern state of Tamil Nadu, left Munambam harbor in Kerala on Jan. 12, two officers involved in the case told Reuters. 
An individual from New Delhi arrested in connection with the investigation, Prabhu Dhandapani, told police the boat was heading to New Zealand, according to both officers. 
Estimates of the number of people on board vary between 100 and 200 people, including women and children, they said. 
Police have recovered more than 70 bags left behind by the migrants, as well as around 20 identification documents, officer VG Ravindran said. 
""The bags are full of dry goods and clothes, suggesting they were preparing for a long journey,"" said officer MJ Sojan. 
""The people and boat are missing somewhere in the sea. Many Indian agencies including the coastguard are trying to locate the boat."" 
For the migrants to reach New Zealand, they would need to travel more than 7,000 miles through some of the roughest seas in the world. Cyclones and storms are common in the straits between Indonesia and Australia, the most likely route for the boat.
A spokesman for New Zealand's department of immigration was not immediately available for comment.

BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The European Union sanctioned on Monday the heads of Russia's military intelligence and two of their officers blamed for poisoning a former Russian double agent in Britain last year, a decision Moscow dismissed as groundless.
The EU travel bans and asset freezes included two men Britain has named as intelligence officers Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov and accused of attempting to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.
The men have denied any involvement in the spraying of a chemical weapon on Skripal's front door in the English city of Salisbury in March.
In a case that has widened Russia's distancing from the West in recent years, the European bloc also sanctioned the head and deputy head of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU).
Their names will be published on Tuesday in the EU's Official Journal, when the sanctions come into force. 
""These designations include the two GRU officials, and the Head and Deputy Head of the GRU responsible for possession, transport and use in Salisbury of a toxic nerve agent on the weekend of 4 March 2018,"" the EU said in a statement after foreign ministers approved the move. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the decision.
""They are suspected groundlessly,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""We have still not heard any evidence.""
Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russia's military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4 last year.
The two men accused of being agents say they were innocent tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral. Britain published CCTV images of them last year.
""We all know the selection of now already famous photographs of these two citizens in Britain. You also know there are many photographs of Russians in Britain and they are not direct evidence,"" Peskov said.
Banned two decades ago under an international treaty, the rising use of nerve agents has alarmed Western governments, and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told Reuters the sanctions aimed to send a message to Moscow.
""It was a message to Russia and to everyone who is considering using chemical weapons in the 21st century in the territory of sovereign states. It's not acceptable,"" he said.

The Russians targeted are the first names to be added to a new EU mechanism to punish chemical weapons attacks using banned munitions, regardless of nationality.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's ELN rebel group on Monday claimed responsibility for last week's car bomb attack against a police academy that killed 21 as a legitimate act of war and urged President Ivan Duque to return to the negotiating table.
The National Liberation Army (ELN) said in a statement on its website that it conducted the attack against a ""military installation"" where officials are trained in intelligence and actively participate in the war.
""The operation carried out against said installations and troops is lawful within the law of war, there were no non-combatant victims,"" the ELN said, adding that the military attacked its camps during an ELN Christmas ceasefire. 
In last Thursday's bombing, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV carrying about 80 kilograms (176 lbs) of high explosive pentolite, broke through checkpoints onto the grounds of the General Santander (MC:SAN) School in the capital, Bogota, before it detonated.
The blast killed 20 cadets between the ages of 18 and 23 and the driver, ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas, officials said.
The car bombing - the worst in Colombia in almost 16 years - brought tens of thousands to streets nationwide on Sunday in protest against violence and solidarity with the police. The attack heightened fears that a new wave of bombings had been launched in reaction to right-wing Duque.
The ELN, made up of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States, began peace talks with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos in February 2017 but were postponed by Duque until the group stops attacks and frees all its hostages.
Duque on Friday asked Cuba, where negotiations were taking place, to capture and extradite 10 rebel leaders engaged in the talks.
The ELN, which was formed by radical Catholic priests in 1964, urged Duque to send a team of peace negotiators back to Havana to restart the talks, stalled when he took office in August.
""President Duque, we reiterate that war is not the future of Colombia, it's peace, so we remind you that the best thing for the country is to send your delegation to the table to give continuity to the peace process,"" the ELN said.
Cuba said it would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks.
The protocols provide minimum security guarantees for guerrilla commanders to return to Colombia, providing security from military attack for an agreed period.
In a tweet on Monday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez condemned attack. 
""Cuba has never allowed, nor will it ever allow, its territory to be used for the perpetration of terrorist actions against any state,"" he said.
The ELN was the second biggest rebel group until peace was signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in late 2016. 

The ELN, which has fought more than a dozen governments, seeks land reform and opposes oil and mining activities by multinational companies, saying they take advantage of natural resources without benefiting Colombians.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considering offering cheap loans and free accidental insurance coverage to millions of small businesses, two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, as he tries to placate a key voter bloc ahead of a general election due by May.
Small business groups have been critical of the Modi government in the past year after many firms were squeezed by a shock move to ban high-value currency notes in 2016, followed by a hasty implementation of a nation-wide goods and services tax (GST) that raised their compliance costs.
In a bid to win them back, and following election losses in five states last month, the government run by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) recently announced GST concessions and tweaked an ecommerce policy in favor of small traders.
More measures are now being planned, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information was not public.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The sources did not quantify the amount the series of measures would cost the government, as details are still being worked out.
The government is working on offering a discount of 2 percentage points on loans for businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million rupees ($701,754), the sources said, and would compensate banks for costs.
Small businesses with a top credit rating can get loans from banks at about 9-10 percent, while lower-rated businesses can be charged around 13-14 percent.
But only about 4 percent of the 70 million small enterprises in India have access to bank credit, said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders.
He said 30 percent of their loans come from the country's shadow banking sector, while more than half are provided by private money lenders at rates as high as 25 percent a month.
One of the sources said the government may also ask banks to open a special window for increasing the credit flow to small businesses, which will ensure greater availability of loans.
The government is also planning to provide free accidental insurance coverage of up to 1 million rupees to small businesses with annual sales of up to 100 million rupees, the sources said.
""Employees of small traders may also get discounts on opting for state-backed insurance schemes,"" one of the sources said.
The government has not yet decided if the moves would be announced before the interim budget on Feb. 1, the sources said.
The government is also considering a pension program for retired traders registered with the government, and a further discount on interest rates paid on loans to women traders.

The attack happened on the western edge of Shadadi town in Hasaka province near a route frequented by the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, residents and sources said.
In a tweet, the coalition said a convoy with allied Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) was involved in an attack, but there were no American casualties. 
Coalition planes flew overhead after the blast around 11 a.m., a Syria-based aid agency worker said, adding that colleagues had reported several casualties including Kurdish soldiers, coalition troops and civilians. 
Four U.S. citizens died in an Islamic State-claimed bombing last week in Manbij city, run by the SDF which is spearheaded by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.
Residents say there has been a spike in recent months in attacks on SDF checkpoints in the swathe of territory it controls in northeast Syria on the border with Turkey, down the Euphrates River towards the border with Iraq.

The United States imposed sanctions on Mahan Air in 2011, saying it provided financial and other support to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and has been pressing its European allies to follow suit.
The German ban on the airline takes immediate effect, a foreign ministry spokesman said.
Contacted by Reuters, Mahan Air in Tehran said it could not comment immediately on the ban.
The measure does not signal plans for the reimposition of broader sanctions against Iran, a German government source told Reuters.
Mahan Air, established in 1992 as Iran's first private airline, has the country's largest fleet of aircraft and has flights to a number of European countries, including France, Italy, Spain and Greece.
The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, who has long objected to Mahan Air's links to Germany, welcomed the ban.
""Mahan Air has flown terrorists, weapons, equipment, and funds to international locations to support Iranian terrorist proxy groups,"" he said in a statement.
""Iran's use of Mahan Air to support the Assad regime in Syria, for example, has contributed to incredible human suffering, violence, and political instability felt across the world,"" he said, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
""SECURITY NEEDS""
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert denied that the decision to ban Mahan air was the result of U.S. pressure.
""The German decision is based on considerations of our security needs,"" he told a regular news conference.
""It cannot be ruled out that this airline could also transport cargo to Germany that threatens our security. This is based on knowledge of past terrorist activities by Iran in Europe,"" he added.
European countries have been under sustained U.S. pressure to reimpose sanctions on Iran since President Donald Trump last year pulled Washington out of a nuclear non-proliferation treaty it had reached with Tehran under his predecessor Barack Obama.
Along with Iran, the other signatories to the deal - Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China - are still trying to keep it alive.

The European countries, with more extensive economic ties to Iran and mindful of the threat that would be posed by another nuclear state in their immediate neighborhood, have sought to shield themselves from the impact of Washington's extra-territorial sanctions, with limited success.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police have thwarted an attack by suspected Somali militants al Shabaab on a Chinese-owned construction company in an eastern region, an official said on Monday, days after the Islamist group killed 21 people in Nairobi. 
The assailants wounded one person while they attempted to hit the site in Garissa county, not far from the Kenyan-Somali border, owned by a Chinese road construction company that is building the Garissa-Modogashe highway.
""The attackers were repulsed since the security officers were very alert. There was exchange of fire before the attackers escaped,"" county police commander David Kerina told Reuters by phone, adding that the injured person was a watchman's wife.
""I believe the attackers, who were armed, might be Somali militants. They fled, but we have intensified security operations. So far no arrest has been made.""
Kerina give no more details about the attack or the site. Al Shabaab, a Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate fighting to impose its interpretation of Islamic law, claimed responsibility for Tuesday's assault on the upscale dusitD2 hotel and office compound that has rocked Kenya.
The group has often targeted Kenya in revenge for sending troops to Somalia, but said the dusitDt attack was due to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Police have arrested nine people over the hotel attack, including one listed as a Canadian.
On Sunday, Kenya police circulated by Twitter pictures and names of another eight people it said they were seeking for involvement in the assault or planning fresh attacks. 
Al Shabaab also killed 67 people in a 2013 assault on a shopping mall in the same upscale neighborhood as last week's attack in Nairobi, which is a hub for expatriate businessmen, diplomats and aid workers. 

In 2015, the group killed 148 students at Garissa University, the worst militant attack for almost two decades.

DAKAR (Reuters) - A Mali-based al Qaeda affiliate has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 10 Chadian peacekeepers in the north of the country, the SITE Intelligence Group said on Monday, citing the Israeli Prime Minister's visit to Chad as the motive.
Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) - an umbrella group for al Qaeda-linked militants in West Africa's Sahara - launched attacks to disrupt Mali's presidential elections in July last year and claimed credit for a spate of attacks in neighboring Burkina Faso.
Their most recent strike occurred near Mali's northern village of Aguelhok on Sunday. Aside from the deaths, assailants in armed vehicles wounded at least 25 others.
SITE, citing a statement from the group, said the attack was carried out in response ""to Chad's diplomatic pursuits with Israel"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Chad on Sunday to stress the two countries' mutual interest in confronting Islamist insurgencies on the continent.
The visit is seen as a bid by Israel to rebuild ties in Africa, damaged by the occupation of Palestinian territories in the 1967 Middle East war. 
Chad's President Idriss Deby visited Jerusalem in November, the first official visit by a Chadian leader since the country severed ties with Israel in 1972.
Deby has been in power since 1990 and has been an ally of the West in a fight against Islamist militants in West Africa. But Chad itself faces destabilizing forces on multiple fronts, including jihadists with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
Violence by Islamist militants has proliferated in the sparsely-populated Sahel in recent years, with groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State using central and northern Mali as a launchpad for attacks across the region.
French forces intervened in 2013 to drive a Tuareg uprising a year earlier, and some 4,000 French troops remain there. The U.N. Security Council then deployed peacekeepers, which have been targets of a concerted guerrilla campaign.

HARARE (Reuters) - Legal challenges to a brutal clampdown on dissent by Zimbabwe's government were set in motion on Monday, as fears that the country is veering back towards authoritarian rule drove some leaders of the main opposition party into hiding.
The fragile state of Zimbabwe's economy was also in focus as President Emmerson Mnangagwa headed home early from a foreign trip during which he had been expected to pitch for investments, while South Africa said it turned down a request from its neighbor for a $1.2 billion loan last month.
The lawyer for pastor Evan Mawarire, a rights activist, said he would seek bail at the High Court after being charged with subversion. Beatrice Mtetwa said she was unsure when the court would hear the case.
Mawarire is the most prominent of hundreds of people, also including four opposition lawmakers, detained on public order charges on Friday following violent protests last week against a fuel price hike. 
Police say three people died during the unrest, but lawyers and human rights groups say evidence suggests at least a dozen were killed while scores were treated for gunshot wounds.
On social media on Monday, many Zimbabweans said the clampdown had the hallmarks of Mnangagwa's deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, a retired general who led the coup that toppled former leader Robert Mugabe in November.
But the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said Mnangagwa - nicknamed ""Crocodile"" during his time as a high-ranking official in Mugabe's strong-arm administration - was similar in outlook.
""These two walk the same path, they may have a different approach from time to time but the objective is the same. They want to dismantle the MDC leadership,"" MDC spokesman Jacob Mafume said, adding that several of its leaders were in hiding.
Mnangagwa's spokesman said on Sunday that the crackdown was a foretaste of how authorities would respond to future unrest.
CHALLENGE TO INTERNET BLACKOUT
In what opponents view as a further attempt to crush dissent, the government has imposed a sporadic internet blackout since Tuesday.
A lawyers' group said it planned to challenge that shutdown in the High Court on Monday afternoon. The action is directed at Zimbabwe's three mobile networks as well as Mnangagwa, the national security minister and the head of the intelligence services.
Mnangagwa, who has been on a four-nation European tour, was expected to try to attract investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. A foreign ministry source said he was now due back in Harare on Monday night.
With high inflation and a shortage of cash in circulation eating into ordinary Zimbabweans' spending power, the government introduced buses to carry passengers at cheaper fares after public taxis increased prices citing the fuel price hike.

Businesses, including banks, shops and government offices re-opened in Harare on Monday but some schools in Chitungwiza town to the south remained closed, residents said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities on Monday opened an investigation into the police killing of four people, including a woman and a child, in an encounter with a suspected militant leader that has drawn accusations from the public of police brutality.
Counter-terrorism officers said an Islamic State leader in Punjab province, Zeeshan Javed, was killed when police fired on a car he was traveling in on Saturday, in the town of Sahiwal.
Three passengers - grocery store owner Muhammad Khalil, his wife and their 12 year-old daughter -- were also killed, police said. 
Police said Javed fired on officers first and weapons were found in the car. That account has been disputed by witnesses, including Khalil's other three children who survived with minor wounds.
The killings triggered protests on Sunday in Lahore, Pakistan's second biggest city, and renewed a debate over extra-judicial killings and police impunity in the South Asian nation where such encounters are not uncommon.
Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked at seeing the traumatized children who saw their parents shot before their eyes"", and promised the state would care for the survivors.
""The grief & anger ... is understandable & justified,"" Khan tweeted on Monday, referring to the public outrage.
He said anyone found guilty would be handed ""exemplary punishment"".
""I will review the entire structure of Punjab police & start process of reforming it,"" he said.
Police investigators were expected to deliver a report on Wednesday, police said.
""The policemen involved in the shooting have not been identified. JIT will identify those involved,"" said Nabeela Ghanzafar, a police spokeswoman, referring to the investigation team.
Officials said Javed was an Islamic State operative.
Punjab law minister Raja Basharat told reporters on Sunday a ""large quantity of explosives"" were found at Javed's home and ""two suicide vests, eight hand grenades, two pistols and bullets"" were recovered from the car.
Basharat said officers from the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) intercepted the car after a tip-off and Javed fired first.
However, videos circulating on social media appear to raise doubts about that.
Khalil's brother, Jalil, told Reuters the Punjab government had offered 20 million rupees ($144,000) compensation for the killings.
""I told the government 'I'm ready to give you back 25 million rupees in return for justice',"" he said.

Japan is seeking a peace deal with Russia it hopes will end a dispute over islands captured by Soviet troops in the last days of World War Two, a disagreement that has long soured bilateral relations.
The islands are known as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has launched a diplomatic campaign to strike a deal with Moscow. 
Abe and President Vladimir Putin are due to hold talks in Moscow on Tuesday after Tokyo and Moscow agreed to intensify their search for a solution. 
The Kremlin warned on Monday that neither Russia nor Japan would abandon their national interests however, that everyone should be realistic about the difficulty of clinching a deal, and that negotiations were still in their early phases.
When asked about a report from Japan's Kyodo news agency which cited unnamed government sources as saying Abe planned to propose signing a peace treaty if Moscow handed back control of two of the disputed islands, the Kremlin declined to comment. 
""Let's wait for tomorrow's talks,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.
""Again though, we urge everyone to be realistic and to proceed from the fact that we must seek a solution with constant respect for the national interests of the two countries.

TIMNA, Israel (Reuters) - Israel opened a new international airport outside its Red Sea resort of Eilat on Monday, hoping to boost winter tourism from Europeans and provide an alternative for times of conflict to its main gateway in Tel Aviv.
Abutting the Jordanian border some 19 km (12 miles) north of Eilat, Ilan and Asaf Ramon Airport cost $500 million and will replace the city's cramped municipal airport as well as Ovda, an Israeli desert airbase that also accommodates civilian traffic.
Named after an Israeli astronaut lost in the 2003 space shuttle disaster and his eldest son, who died in a 2009 air force accident, the single-runway Ramon is designed for wide-body planes and an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers.
Jordan and Egypt, Red Sea neighbors which both have peace treaties with Israel, may also benefit from transit tourists landing there, Israeli officials say.
""It (Ramon) is going to be a regional airport and if some of our tourists are going to Aqaba and Taba, that’s great,"" Chanan Moscowitz, head of Eilat-area airport operations, told Reuters, referring to the Jordan and Egyptian border terminals. 
""It means that the area is quiet.""
Ramon is designed to take any planes re-routed from Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv - a lesson of the 2014 Gaza war, when foreign carriers briefly halted flights there because of Palestinian rocket fire. Israel worries that Ben Gurion could also be targeted by Lebanese Hezbollah rocketeers.
Ramon is 200 km (124 miles) from Gaza and 370 km (230 miles) from Lebanon. It is at a safe remove from Islamist insurgents in the Egyptian Sinai who have fired short-range rockets at Eilat in the past, and has a security fence billed as a precaution against shoulder-fired missile attacks from Jordan.
Eilat has seen a big revival in tourism since 2015, when Israel offered airlines 60 euros ($70) per passenger brought on direct flights from abroad to Ovda. Taxes and fees were also scrapped for three years to lower fares.
That lured airlines such as Ryanair - which has a 50 percent market share to Eilat for its winter flights - and Wizzair, which is next at 18 percent. Lufthansa began nonstop flights to Eilat in October.

Moskowitz said foreign tourism to Eilat doubled over the last two years. Tourism from Russia, Hungary, Poland and Lithuania, via Ovda airport, has been especially brisk.

The birth rate stood at 10.94 per thousand, the lowest since 1949 and down from 12.43 per thousand in 2017, data from the statistics bureau showed. The number of babies born in 2018 fell by two million to 15.23 million.
The rate of natural increase in population, deducting the number of deaths, also slowed to the lowest since the aftermath of a disastrous famine in the early 1960s.
China allowed urban couples to have two children in 2016, replacing a one-child policy in place since 1979, with policymakers wary of falling birth rates and a rapidly growing aging population. 
In January, a government-affiliated think tank warned that the population in the world's second-biggest economy could start to shrink as soon as 2027.

The statistics bureau did not suggest a reason for the birth rate decline but economic growth last year fell to its lowest in nearly three decades.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 04:26AM ET</span>","At a top Chinese university, activist 'confessions' strike fear into students","By Christian Shepherd
BEIJING (Reuters) - In late December, on the leafy streets of China's prestigious Peking University, a handful of students held up banners to protest against a takeover of the campus Marxist society by the Chinese Communist Party-affiliated Student Association.
Within an hour, police rushed at the group and dragged them into a nearby building, where, barricaded in classrooms, they were shown videos of recent graduates, including one from their own university, ""confessing"" to working with an ""illegal organization"" to arrange protests in southern China, students involved told Reuters.
On Monday, a solidarity group that has been calling for the activists to be released posted online statements decrying the videos as ""slander"".
Friends of the activists told Reuters that the videos distorted facts and were an attempt to threaten those who have been calling for the release of dozens who have been detained since August.
The private screening was part of efforts by Chinese authorities to stem a groundswell of activism on China's university campuses, with students taking up causes from #MeToo to the rights of migrant and factory workers.
Chinese authorities have in recent years made increasing use of video ""confessions"" to seize the public narrative in politically charged cases and to make an example of those detained as a warning to others, rights groups say.
A Peking University spokeswoman declined to comment due to the university currently being on winter break. China's Public Security Ministry did not reply to a faxed request for comment.
The videos shown to the students last month focus on events in July 2018, when Chinese police quashed protests by workers from a welding equipment manufacturer in the southern city of Shenzhen who wanted to form a labor union with leaders of their choice.
Around 50 students and activists from across China had flocked to support the workers, sparking waves of further detentions that spread to China's top university campuses, including Peking University, informally known as Beida.
The videos featured four activists in their 20s, all recent graduates, saying that they had spread ""false information"", founded organizations that intended to ""overthrow"" the government and worked in concert with foreign media.
Shen Mengyu, Zheng Yongming and Gu Jiayue - all of whom had supported workers at Jasic International, the welding equipment firm - said they had been assigned by an unnamed ""organization"" to organize the worker protests.
Yue Xin, a Beida graduate who first made headlines in April 2018 for her vocal #MeToo activism, said that the Shenzhen protests had been ""politically motivated"" and created a ""negative impact on society"".
Yue also renounced her earlier efforts, inspired by the global #MeToo movement, to force Beida to divulge information about a decades-old rape case.
""At the time people placed too much importance on public disclosure,"" she says in the video, according to students who have seen the clip, adding that ""foreign forces fixated with China's bad side"" had exploited this desire to ""provoke troubles"".
It was not possible to contact Yue, Gu, Zheng or Shen for comment.
""INVERT BLACK AND WHITE""
The versions of events given by the activists in the video are radically different from how close friends recall the incidents described, four of them told Reuters, declining to be named for fear of reprisals from the authorities.
""There has been no news of these classmates since they went missing in August. No one, whether family or lawyers, has been allowed to see them. Where they are being held, what they have suffered, we don't have a clue,"" one of the friends said.
The reference in the videos to an ""illegal organization"" that orchestrated the protests was an attempt to ""invert black and white"", given it was the workers' protests that drew activist support, not the other way around, the same source said.
""The left-wing students and the support group's actions are guided by Marxism, are answering Chairman Xi Jinping's call and are in line with Socialist ideas,"" another said, referring to Xi's calls for China to stick with Marxist theories.
Since 2012, when Chinese President Xi Jinping took office, law enforcement authorities in China have made increasing use of ""confessions"", often delivered via state media, during politically charged cases, sometimes involving foreign citizens.
TOOL OF ""TERROR""
Gu and Zheng are being held in a form of detention known as ""residential surveillance at a designated location"", or RSDL, according to notices sent to their families and seen by students. 
The controversial measure allows police to interrogate suspects for six months without legal representation and is meant to be reserved for severe crimes such as ""endangering national security"", ""terrorism"" or serious bribery crimes.
Rights groups say that the lack of oversight gives police carte blanche in their interrogations, allowing torture and forced confessions, including those that can then be publicly released.
China aired nearly 50 such confessions between 2013 and 2018, according to RSDL Monitor, a group run by Madrid-based rights activist Peter Dahlin, who featured in one such video himself, aired by China's state broadcaster in 2016.
People who are asked to make confession videos tends to have been detained for some time, and have often been physically or mentally tortured, Dahlin told Reuters.
Under RSDL, he was held in solitary confinement, denied sleep and interrogated for about six hours per day, according to a book Dahlin wrote about China's use of ""confessions"".
After three weeks, he provided a scripted ""interview"" to state broadcaster journalists to try and speed up his release and that of his Chinese girlfriend, he wrote.
""These 'confession' videos not only serve a more generic propaganda purpose, they tend to be aimed as tools of political terror, using one or a few people to create fear in their larger communities,"" Dahlin said in an interview.
China's Foreign Ministry said in 2016 that Dahlin had pleaded guilty to crimes of endangering national security and was expelled from China in accordance with Chinese law.

Chinese state media has defended RSDL as being necessary to ensure that legal procedures ""proceed smoothly"" in complicated or sensitive cases.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh has denied entry to 31 Rohingya Muslims trying to enter from India and they are stuck in no-man's land on the border, Bangladesh authorities said on Monday, as India cracks down on members of the community.
The stranded Rohingya, including women and children, had been living in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) official who said he had seen some of their identity cards issued by the U.N. refugee agency in India.
The 31 had been stuck on Bangladesh's border with northeast India since Friday, said the BGB commander in the area, Golam Kabir.
""We stopped them as they were crossing the border,"" Kabir told Reuters by telephone.
""They've been on the zero line since the 18th of this month,"" he said, referring to the border.Two rounds of talks on what to do with the 31, with India's Border Security Force on Sunday, had ""ended without any conclusive decision"", Kabir said.
Many hundreds of thousands of members of mostly Buddhist Myanmar's Rohingya community have left their homes in Myanmar's Rakhine Sate over the decades, most fleeing military crackdowns and discrimination.
Many have sought shelter in Bangladesh - where nearly 1 million live - but others have ended up in India, Southeast Asia and beyond.
An Indian border force officer in Tripura state told reporters on Sunday that they were providing food and clothing to the Rohingya, 16 of whom were children. 
The force could not be reached for comment on Monday.
India estimates that 40,000 Rohingya are living in scattered settlements in various parts of the country. 
But its Hindu nationalist government regards them as illegal aliens and a security threat, and has ordered that they be identified and repatriated.
The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, has issued about 16,500 Rohingya in India with identity cards that it says can help ""prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation"". India does not recognize the cards.
Hundreds of Rohingya families have left India for Bangladesh since seven Rohingya men were deported to Myanmar in October. This month, India sent a Rohingya family of five to Myanmar.
The United Nations says conditions are not conducive for Rohingya to return to Myanmar.
In August, the United Nations accused the Myanmar military of mass killings and rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" in a 2017 military operation that drove more than 700,000 of them into Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.

Myanmar has denied the accusations, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim terrorists.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - As the sun set on an upmarket hotel complex in Nairobi, Serge Medic's phone pinged with a message from his son: ""Dad, are you OK?... Don't do anything silly, please.""
Medic chuckled as he recounted the moment.
""It was 18:43. Too late.""
Three hours earlier, at least four gunmen and a suicide bomber had stormed 14 Riverside Drive, a leafy office, restaurant and hotel complex in the heart of Kenya's capital, kicking off a 20-hour siege in which 21 people were killed.
At 3.39 p.m. (1339 GMT), Medic, the 56-year-old Swiss founder of a private security firm, was on his way home from work in a taxi when he saw injured people being carried along the side of the road.
At the same moment, a flurry of WhatsApp messages pinged on his phone from a group called ""LFH (Licensed Firearm Holders) Kenya.""
""Seems to be an attack of some sort. Heavy explosions and gunfire,"" one message read.
Medic turned the taxi around and headed towards the complex, a plush regional headquarters for international companies such as Colgate Palmolive,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and SAP.
As the car hit traffic, he grabbed his khaki emergency bag and ran the remaining 500 metres towards the billowing black smoke and the sound of gunfire.
""At the time, there was no thought about being a hero,"" Medic told Reuters. ""It was automatic.""
Entering the compound, he joined forces with two Kenyans in civilian clothes, each carrying a 9mm carbine and a shotgun.
Medic drew his pistol. The motley volunteers were the first rescuers on the scene.
At 3.59 p.m. they made their way past three burning cars and discovered the glass facade of I&M Bank riddled with bullet holes.
""Somewhere in my mind, I hoped that it was just a bank robbery gone wrong, because bank robbers, after all, are more reasonable people than terrorists,"" he said.
    
KITCHEN KNIVES
Rounding the corner, they heard gunshots from the direction of the dusitD2 hotel and paused.
When the gunfire stopped, they moved slowly towards the hotel lobby, checking for ditches to dive into in case of a grenade attack. On the path they discovered a severed arm belonging to a suicide bomber who, half an hour earlier, had detonated his vest outside the Secret Garden restaurant.
""I remember vividly it had a shiny ring on one of the fingers,"" Medic said.
As they walked over the shattered glass of the hotel's front doors, Medic worried about a new threat: booby traps.
Then they came under fire from automatic weapons.
""We were sitting ducks,"" Medic said.
He fired two shots as the group lay down suppressing fire and, one by one, ran back to their position behind the bank.
At 4.02 p.m. Medic sent a message to the group: ""I've just been shot at in dusit.""
By now a mix of Kenyan security teams had arrived, along with several other armed civilians.
With the number and location of attackers still unknown, Medic joined a dozen maroon-bereted policemen in securing an adjacent office block, the Arlington building.
They swept from floor to floor, kicking down glass doors and evacuating dozens of terrified office workers, coaxing them out from their hiding places under desks and in cupboards.
On the fifth floor, they found the office to  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a French drinks manufacturer, protected by an impenetrable metal door.
A voice from the other side refused to unlock it. Medic tried wrenching the handle but it came off in his hand. 
Eventually, the person on the other side relented.
""As we opened it the (boss) was waiting with a big kitchen knife,"" Medic said. ""Some other staff had some other small kitchen knives.""
Cowering behind them were 20 or 30 employees. 
""I found that quite courageous.""
Medic helped them out of the building and, with the dying of the light, the U.S.-trained commando unit known as SPEAR arrived and sealed the area off to civilians.
That's when Medic's children started calling and bombarding him with messages.

""They were all basically telling me off,"" Medic said. ""You are 30m away from terrorists,"" his 21-year-old daughter wrote at 6.30 p.m. ""Go home.""

BEIRUT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel struck in Syria early on Monday as part of its increasingly open assault on Iran's presence there, shaking the night sky over Damascus with an hour of loud explosions in a second consecutive night of military action. 
The threat of open confrontation between arch-enemies Israel and Iran has long simmered in Syria, as the Iranian military has established a presence there since early in its civil war in support of President Bashar al-Assad against rebels
Israel, regarding Iran as its biggest threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets and those of allied militia, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, in Syria, aiming to push them far from its frontier. 
The Israeli military said its fighter jets had attacked the Iranian targets early on Monday, including munition stores, a position in the Damascus International Airport, an intelligence site and a military training camp. 
Israeli jets then targeted Syrian defense batteries after coming under fire, the Israeli military said, and the Defence Ministry of Russia, Assad's strongest ally, said four Syrian soldiers were killed and six wounded. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 11 people had been killed.
Syrian air defenses, supplied by Russia, had destroyed more than 30 cruise missiles and guided bombs, the Russian Defence Ministry said, according to RIA news agency. 
Syrian state media, citing a military source, said the country had endured ""intense attack through consecutive waves of guided missiles, but had destroyed most ""hostile targets"".
Israel's target was the Iranian Quds Force, a special unit in charge of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps overseas operations, the Israeli military said. 
It followed a previous night of cross-border fire, which Israel said was prompted by a rocket fired at a packed ski resort in the Golan Heights, close to the frontier with Syria.
Israel did not say who it suspected of carrying out the rocket attack.
Syria said it was Israel that had attacked, and its own air defenses that had repelled the assault.
NETANYAHU 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is hoping to win a fifth term in an April 9 election, has been playing up military sorties into Syria that Israel had previously preferred to keep quiet. 
""We have a permanent policy, to strike at the Iranian entrenchment in Syria and hurt whoever tries to hurt us,"" he said on Sunday. 
Israel, which appointed a new military chief last week, also appeared keen to signal zero tolerance for Sunday's rocket launch, which it said had been foiled by its Iron Dome interceptor system.
The Israeli army said the Mount Hermon ski resort in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights would be shut for the day. It added that otherwise things remained ""routine"" along the frontier with Syria.
Netanyahu last week acknowledged an Israeli attack on what he called an Iranian arms cache in Syria, where Tehran provides Damascus with vital support.
He told his cabinet Israel had carried out ""hundreds"" of attacks over the past years of Syria's war to curtail Iran and its ally Hezbollah.
Iran has said it has no plans to quit Syria, where it has helped Assad fight off an eight-year rebellion against his rule. Most of the country is now back under Damascus' control, and Assad's alliances with both Iran and Russia remain very strong. 
Last summer, he took back rebel-held territory in southwest Syria, near the Golan Heights, in a campaign that was supported by Iran-backed militias.

The measure would benefit several high-level politicians, including Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the ruling Social Democrat Party, who was ruled out from being prime minister by a 2015 suspended jail term in a vote-rigging case.
""I have drafted an emergency decree that ... will enable all those convicted by illegally-formed panels to challenge (the verdicts),"" Justice Minister Tudorel Toader told private television station Romania TV late on Sunday.
""I have found this solution and drafted the decree, the prime minister will decide.""
The measure is the latest in a series of legislative and personnel changes made by the ruling Social Democrats since they took power two years ago.
The moves have been seen as threats to judicial independence and could further heighten EU concerns about democratic values in some of the eastern nations among its members. 
In November, the government requested, and obtained, a Constitutional Court ruling that five-judge panels of the Supreme Court were illegally formed because not all judges had been randomly selected, as required by a 2013 legal change.
The Supreme Court had interpreted the change to mean that four of the judges would be selected at random, except for the chief judges of the panels. 
But the November ruling of the Constitutional Court clarified the nature of the legal change, allowing several recently convicted politicians to challenge the verdicts in their cases and walk free.
It did not affect older cases, however, in which the deadlines to challenge convictions had lapsed. 
After the justice minister on Sunday said his decree would allow challenges to all convictions by the incorrectly-formed panels, the opposition Save Romania Union (USR) called the step illegal, as it would retroactively reopen finished cases.
But government decrees take effect immediately and are harder to challenge. 
Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels, which keeps its justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft.

Anti-corruption prosecutors have been cracking down on high-level graft in recent years, convicting people across parties put on trial at a steady rate of just under 90 percent in 2017.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2019 12:48AM ET</span>",Student in Trump hat denies mocking Native American activist in videotaped encounter,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - A white high school student seen with classmates appearing to confront a Native American Vietnam veteran near the Lincoln Memorial issued a statement on Sunday that video of the incident that went viral gives the false impression that the teens were instigators.
Nick Sandmann, a student from the private, all-male Covington Catholic High School in northern Kentucky, is seen in the video standing face to face with the Indian activist, Nathan Phillips, staring at him with a smile, while Phillips sings and plays a drum.
The footage, shared online by organizers of an indigenous people's march that took place in Washington on Friday before the incident, shows a group of fellow Covington students surrounding Phillips apparently mocking him.
Phillips recounted in a separate video that he heard the students chanting ""build that wall,"" during the encounter. 
The students, many wearing baseball caps emblazoned with President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan, were in the nation's capital the same day for an anti-abortion rally.
The footage sparked outrage on social media and led the high school to issue a statement condemning the students' actions and promising an investigation.
But Sandmann, whose statement was tweeted by CNN anchor Jake Tapper late on Sunday, insisted the video was misinterpreted, leading to ""outright lies being spread about my family and me.""
He denied acting with any disrespect toward Phillips.
According to Sandmann, his group was waiting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for their bus back to Kentucky when four African American protesters nearby began shouting racially charged insults at them.
With permission from their teacher chaperones, the students responded by shouting ""school spirit"" chants to ""drown out the hateful comments"" directed at them.
In the midst of this interaction, Sandmann said, he noticed that a Native American protester - since identified as Phillips - ""began playing his drum as he waded into the crowd, which parted for him.""
""He locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face. He played his drum the entire time he was in my face,"" Sandmann recalled.
""I never interacted with this protester. I did not speak to him. I did not make any hand gestures or other aggressive moves,"" Sandmann wrote, adding that he was ""startled and confused"" as to why Phillips approached him.
Sandmann said he reasoned that by remaining ""motionless and calm"" he hoped to defuse the situation.
His account was reinforced, at least in part, by a New York Times report on Sunday quoting Phillips, 64, as acknowledging he had approached the crowd of students in a bid to ease racial tensions that had flared between the mostly white teens and the African American protesters.
""I stepped in between to pray,"" said Phillips, an elder of Nebraska's Omaha tribe and a well-known activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota.
Phillips could not be reached by Reuters for comment over the weekend.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - One of Nicaragua's most influential political watchdog reporters said on Sunday he has gone into exile in Costa Rica after receiving threats from the government, which has led a heavy-handed crackdown on protests against President Daniel Ortega.
Carlos Fernando Chamorro had accused the government of using increasingly authoritarian tactics to purge Nicaragua of dissent. 
The famed reporter announced on his television program he had fled to Costa Rica, without detailing the threats that prompted him to leave Nicaragua. He said he planned to keep reporting from the city of San Jose, where the government has welcomed him and his wife. 
He told Reuters in an interview in late December he had been targeted with death threats on social media and feared the government could trump up charges as an excuse to throw him in jail. Chamorro said police had raided his offices earlier in December and taken his equipment, forcing him to work almost in hiding.
Nicaragua's government did not respond to a request for comment. It has repeatedly said freedom of expression exists in the country.
Chamorro, the son of former President Violeta Chamorro and a frequent critic of Ortega, runs the digital newspaper Confidencial and hosts television news programs.
His father, slain journalist and businessman Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, opposed right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza in the late 1970s while at the helm of La Prensa newspaper. The younger Chamorro won an award from the Columbia Journalism School in 2010 for his watchdog coverage of Nicaragua.
Beginning in April, Nicaragua has experienced one of its worst crises since a 1980s civil war, with protests raging for months before being stifled by the government.

More than 300 people were killed in the protests and more than 500 were incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights. Dozens of journalists have been beaten and threatened, human rights groups say.

MANILA (Reuters) - Minority Muslims in the southern Philippines cast votes on Monday in a long-awaited referendum on autonomy, the culmination of a peace process to end decades of separatist conflict in a region plagued by poverty, banditry and Islamist extremism.
Some 2.8 million people in the volatile Mindanao region are being asked if they back a plan by separatists and the government to create a self-administered area known as Bangsamoro, or ""nation of Moros"", referring to the name Spanish colonialists gave to the area's Muslim inhabitants.
A clear ""yes"" vote is widely expected, which would grant executive, legislature and fiscal powers to a region where more than 120,000 people died a four-decade conflict that left it one of Asia's poorest and at risk of infiltration by radical groups. 
Philippine referendum on Muslim autonomous region: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hk3s7L
The central government would continue to oversee defense, security, foreign and monetary policy, and appoint a transition authority run by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the separatist group expected to dominate the new setup after a 2022 election.
""We are confident that 'yes' will win,"" MILF chairman Murad Ebrahim told CNN Philippines on Monday.
""If there is no manipulation, no intimidating, there will be overwhelming approval,"" he added.
That would be a much-needed boost for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who remains a hugely popular personality among Filipinos but has so far struggled to make inroads on his ambitious policy agenda.
Though the Bangsamoro plan was negotiated by his predecessors, Duterte, a mayor in Davao City in Mindanao for 22 years, is credited with ensuring it got the support of Congress, which the previous administration was unable to secure.
A result is expected by Friday. Duterte last week urged voters to approve the plan and show they wanted peace, development and a local leadership that ""truly represents and understand the needs of the Muslim people"".
The plan's advocates say it would address what are the predominantly Catholic country's lowest levels of employment, income, education and development, which experts say are exploited by pirates, kidnapping gangs and armed groups that have pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
The MILF has denounced extremists and said disillusionment over the slow progress towards devolution was a factor behind a 2017 occupation of Marawi City by rebels loyal to Islamic State, which the military took five months of ground offensives and devastating air strikes to defeat.
The whole of Mindanao has since been under martial law.

The MILF and the government hope autonomy would lead to greater investment in infrastructure and natural resources, and allow for expansion of fruit and nickel exports and development of a palm oil industry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Plunging temperatures after a wet winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of the U.S. Northeast were expected to flash freeze much of the region on Sunday and make travel dicey during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday.
""Any water that remains on the road will freeze into a sheet of ice and make conditions quite hazardous,"" said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS).
Sub-zero temperatures tied to gusting winds prompted the NWS to issue wind chill advisories and warnings for more than 10 states, from North Dakota and other parts of the central United States to East Coast metropolitan centers including Washington, New York and Boston.
It will be a roller-coaster ride for temperatures, with Sunday's warm start melting overnight snow and threatening flooding in areas including southeastern Massachusetts. By evening, temperatures were expected to dive into a dangerous flash freeze.
High temperatures for Monday are forecast at 17 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) for New York City, and 12 F (minus 11 C) for Boston.
""Behind this winter storm is a lot of cold air that has been dropping south from Canada,"" said Otto by telephone from College Park, Maryland. ""You combine that with winds gusting between 20 and 30 miles an hour and you have pretty dangerous windchills of 10 to 30 below zero.""
The storm has already dropped heavy snow in Pennsylvania, although the deepest amount reported was 16 inches (41 cm) in the northern New York town of Lake Desolation, he said. It was headed for Maine, where it was expected to lay a white carpet up to 2 feet deep.
While the mercury will dive in the Northeast, forecasters say it is unlikely to fall below the storm's current low of minus 46 Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) recorded in Cotton, Minnesota. 
The wintry weather has contributed to travel disruption across the United States during a busy holiday weekend, with 1,458 flight cancellations and 989 flight delays by mid-morning on Sunday, according to FlightAware.com.

Amtrak canceled or modified its Sunday train service from Boston to Washington and between Chicago and the East Coast.

After seeing her deal to leave the European Union resoundingly defeated in parliament last week, May has opened talks with lawmakers from all parties to try to find a way to move forward with Brexit.
She is due to return to parliament on Monday to outline her plans, but with just weeks before Britain is due to leave in March and little concrete yet to have come out of those talks, some lawmakers are trying to wrest more control over Brexit.
The future of Brexit, Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy since World War Two, has never been so uncertain.
Corbyn has said he will enter into talks with May only if the prime minister rules out a so-called no-deal Brexit, a scenario in which Britain leaves without an agreement and one that some businesses say would be disastrous for the economy.
""We're ready to talk to the government and others in parliament about a sensible alternative plan, but not while Theresa May is wasting 171,000 pounds ($220,000) an hour of taxpayers' money on dangerous and unnecessary no-deal brinkmanship,"" he said in a statement.
""If the prime minister is serious about finding a solution that can command support in parliament and bring our country together, she must listen to the majority of MPs (lawmakers), as well as members of her own cabinet, and take 'no deal' off the table.""
Labour said some of its top team would visit businesses around the country on Monday to discuss the dangers of a ""no deal"" Brexit.
On Sunday, trade minister Liam Fox said May's plan was still the best basis for a divorce deal. He suggested it could win support from parliament with a few tweaks to the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure no return to a hard border between the British province and Ireland.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The probe involving cash transfers into the account of President Jair Bolsonaro's son is not related to the government, Vice President Hamilton Mourao said on Sunday in an interview with Reuters.
""Flavio Bolsonaro has nothing to do with our government,"" Mourao said, referring to the former Rio de Janeiro lawmaker and senator-elect. Mourao became interim president on Sunday evening after Bolsonaro left for the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
Mourao also said the investigations have not yet concluded. 
Recent news reports showed the Council for Financial Activities Control, known as COAF, found 48 deposits made into the account of Flavio Bolsonaro, one of President Jair Bolsonaro's sons. Flavio has also made a 1 million reais ($266,652) payment.
COAF has also found 7 million reais ($1.9 million) in financial transactions in accounts belonging to Flavio Bolsonaro's former driver, Fabricio Queiroz, over three years, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported on Sunday.
In an interview with Record TV on Sunday evening, Flavio Bolsonaro said the 1 million reais payment was made in 2017 to state-controlled bank Caixa Economica Federal and is related to the purchase of a condo that he has since sold.
He said he made the cash deposits himself with money he received from a company he owns. Flavio Bolsonaro said he could not explain the transactions found by COAF in his former driver's accounts.
The investigations are a new embarrassment for Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who took office on Jan. 1 vowing to stamp out endemic graft and show zero tolerance to corruption within his government.
The supreme court agreed last week to a request from Flavio Bolsonaro's lawyers to suspend a probe into suspicious payments to Queiroz. 
Flavio's lawyers argued that, as a senator-elect, he now enjoys certain legal protections, including that any case involving him should only be decided by the top court.
In the Record TV interview, he said data from his bank accounts was ""illegally"" leaked after being accessed without a court order, but he did not say who he held responsible.

ISTANBUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey is ready to take over security in Syria's Manbij, where four U.S. citizens died in an Islamic State-claimed bombing last week, President Tayyip Erdogan told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Sunday, the Turkish presidency said.
Erdogan told Trump that the suicide bombing in Manbij, a town in northeast Syria controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, was a provocative act aimed at affecting Trump's decision last month to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.
Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring the Islamic State militant group had been defeated there, a view not shared by many experts.
Manbij, which U.S.-backed forces captured from Islamic State in 2016, has emerged as a focal point of tensions after Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has effectively deterred Turkey from attacking Kurdish forces. 
Manbij is controlled by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia allied to the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG. Ankara views the YPG as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has for decades waged a separatist insurgency in Turkey.
In its description of the call, the White House made no mention of Erdogan's offer to take over security in Manbij but said the two men agreed to keep pursuing a negotiated settlement for northeastern Syria that meets both nations' security needs.
""President Trump underscored the importance of defeating terrorist elements that remain in Syria,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a description of the call.
""The two leaders agreed to continue to pursue a negotiated solution for northeast Syria that achieves our respective security concerns. They also discussed their mutual interest in expanding the trade relationship between the United States and Turkey,"" the spokeswoman added.
Trump has previously warned Turkey not to attack the Kurds in Syria and appeared to threaten Turkey's economy if it did.
In its statement, the Turkish presidency also said that the two leaders had agreed to accelerate discussions between their chiefs of staff about a safe zone in northeastern Syria.
Last week, Trump suggested creating a safe zone, without elaborating. The SDF said on Wednesday it was ready to help create a safe zone, as fears grow that the U.S. withdrawal will give Turkey the opportunity to mount a new assault.

Turkey wants the zone to be cleared of the Kurdish group.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 07:04PM ET</span>","Explainer: Mexico's fuel woes rooted in chronic theft, troubled refineries","By David Alire Garcia and Marianna Parraga
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nearly a month after Mexico's new president launched an ambitious plan to stamp out growing fuel theft, the strategy meant to crush corruption and organized crime is under heightened scrutiny. 
On Friday, at least 79 people died from a powerful explosion at a gasoline pipeline in central Mexico that had been punctured by fuel thieves. Relatives of some of the victims said fuel shortages stemming from the government's crackdown led people to risk their lives filling plastic containers from the leak. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, said the tragedy has not weakened his faith in the plan. Since late December, he has closed six major pipelines where criminal gangs and other thieves have siphoned off stolen fuel worth billions of dollars. 
Lopez Obrador is moving distribution to trucks, but that switch has caused delivery delays and long lines at gas stations, threatening to crimp the economy and hurt his popularity if shortages persist.
The veteran leftist won a landslide election victory on promises to root out endemic corruption, strengthen ailing national oil company Pemex and ensure stable fuel prices. 
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH FUEL THEFT IN MEXICO?
Mexico's fast-growing motor fuel market is a juicy target for thieves. It is the world's sixth biggest, according to energy ministry data, featuring a total daily demand of nearly 1.18 million barrels of gasoline and diesel.
The Mexican government's lack of attention has allowed organized groups to open clandestine taps along Pemex's main pipelines. Internal complicity at Pemex refineries and terminals have also opened the door for theft of entire trucks loaded with fuel. 
Fuel stolen from Pemex's infrastructure mostly ends in the hands of the same retailers that legally sell Pemex gasoline and diesel.
HOW DID FUEL THEFT START AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? 
Fuel theft has been a problem in Mexico for decades but it has been growing in recent years. The crackdown on the drug war has caused gangs to turn to other forms of theft, and the nation's network of pipelines proved to be ripe targets. 
Theft escalated in recent years following reforms to the country's oil sector by previous President Enrique Pena Nieto, who liberalized the industry for foreign investment. In turn, retail prices rose, giving cartels an opportunity to undercut those prices through black-market sales of gasoline.
Thieves tap into pipelines and are currently siphoning off the equivalent of around one-fifth of total national gasoline consumption, about 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) according to Reuters calculations based on official data. They then re-sell mostly to complicit gas stations. 
Pemex documented more than 12,500 illegal taps to its fuel pipeline network during the first 10 months of 2018, more than in the previous year. The widespread theft costs Pemex more than $3 billion annually, according to official numbers.
Lopez Obrador has said upwards of 80 percent of the theft is organized by Pemex employees, though he has not provided evidence. He has also pointed to reports that the union has been restricting access to parts of the company's operations. 
Central and western states including Queretaro, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Michoacan and Jalisco are most afflicted by the pipeline theft, as well as Pemex's Salamanca refinery, which has been especially plagued by organized crime and violent disruptions.
WHY ISN'T MEXICO PRODUCING ENOUGH GASOLINE?
For years, Pemex's six domestic oil refineries have operated well below their capacity, due to a mix of underinvestment, deferred maintenance and frequent accidents, including deadly explosions that have provoked costly stoppages.
Las year, the refineries operated at about a third of their 1.63-million-barrel-per day crude processing capacity, compared with 2013, when they processed nearly 1.4 million barrels of crude a day. 
HOW DOES MEXICO MEET ITS FUEL NEEDS? 
Mexico has grown increasingly dependent on fuel imports in recent years, with imported gasoline, distillates and liquefied petroleum gas growing last year to about two-thirds of total demand. In 2016, imports and domestic production each accounted for roughly half. 
Mexico has 16 marine terminals capable of receiving imported fuel, plus 74 storage facilities and over 8,800 kilometers of pipelines. The imports flow mainly through the Pajaritos, Tuxpan and Veracruz terminals on the country's Gulf coast, which have recently turned into bottlenecks for the imports. 
Mexico is a critical export market for U.S. refiners and trading firms, and is the biggest buyer of U.S. gasoline and diesel. In October, the United States exported 621,000 bpd of gasoline to Mexico, accounting for roughly 60 percent of the 1.03 million bpd exported that month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
While the volumes are much lower than supplies transported by sea, rail shipments of fuels across the U.S.-Mexico land border have also grown substantially as U.S. firms have capitalized on Mexico's growing demand, hitting record highs several times since early 2017, according to data from the Association of American Railroads, the largest U.S. rail trade group.
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING?
The new government began the closure of major fuel pipelines on December 27. Production at Pemex's Gulf coast Madero and Minatitlan refineries has also been partially or completely halted, which contributes to the need for imported fuels as a replacement. 
Lopez Obrador hopes some 5,000 tanker trucks can distribute supplies to over 11,000 gas stations scattered across the country. While the vast majority of the stations are Pemex franchises, a growing number belong to new private entrants, including giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and trading firm  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN), which in some cases import their own fuel. 
The cost of transporting gasoline and diesel by tanker trucks is nearly 14 times more expensive than via pipelines, according to a study by Mexico's Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or Cofece.
Both Pemex and Lopez Obrador have sought to assure an increasingly restless public that there is plenty of gasoline and that refineries and other key installations are being supervised by 4,000 soldiers. He has also pleaded with citizens to be patient while the new distribution system is normalized.

Lopez Obrador's team has yet to explain how it will finance the much more expensive distribution costs it is now incurring.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador is setting up new units to check Venezuelan immigrants' legal status and may tighten entry requirements after a Venezuelan man murdered his pregnant Ecuadorian girlfriend, President Lenin Moreno said on Sunday.
The killing in the northern city of Ibarra is the first reported murder perpetrated by a Venezuelan immigrant in Ecuador since hundreds of thousands have arrived there after fleeing an economic crisis in Venezuela.
""I have ordered the immediate setting up of units to control Venezuelan immigrants' legal status in the streets, in the workplace, and at the border,"" Moreno said on Twitter.
The government, he added, may create a new ""special permit"" for Venezuelans to enter the country. He did not give further details about the units or how they will operate.
""Ecuador is and will be a country of peace. I will not allow any criminal to take that away from us,"" he said.
The Venezuelan man held his victim hostage on a busy street for about an hour on Saturday evening before stabbing her to death. He was then arrested by police. 
Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said she had fired Ibarra's police chief for not preventing the murder, which she said officers could have used force to prevent.
Ecuador estimates that some 1.3 million Venezuelans entered the country last year via Colombia, though most continue to Peru, fleeing a hyperinflationary collapse back home that has left millions unable to obtain basic food or medicine. 
Last year, Ecuador's government said it was changing entry requirements to require that Venezuelans present a passport, but a judge blocked that change.
The president of the Association of Venezuelans in Ecuador, Daniel Regalado, said the murder risked demonising Venezuelans just because they did not have legal status.

""These are isolated cases and they don't involve the whole Venezuelan community in Ecuador,"" Regalado said in an interview.

The U.S. guided-missile destroyer Donald Cook began moving towards the Black Sea on Saturday, ""to conduct maritime security operations and enhance regional maritime stability, combined readiness and naval capability"", a U.S. navy statement said. https://www.navy.mil/index.asp
The Russian Black Sea fleet began monitoring the warship once it entered the region, RIA news agency cited Russia's National Defence Control Centre as saying on Saturday.
""U.S. warships are becoming frequent visitors to the Black Sea. These visits have nothing to do with U.S. security,"" Pushkov, a member of Russia's Upper House Commission on Information Policy, wrote on his Twitter page. 
""They flaunt their flag, send us a signal, and appease their own senators, who are demanding they send a whole military fleet to the Black Sea. They should keep away from our coastline,"" he wrote.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 02:39PM ET</span>",Germany's Maas skeptical on UK-Ireland talks solving Brexit deadlock,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Sunday it was unclear how any talks between Britain and Ireland on resolving the question of the Irish backstop could help the European Union's deal with London on Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is to set out her plans for Brexit on Monday after UK lawmakers rejected her deal with the EU last week, throwing the process into disarray. The United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc on March 29.
Asked by ZDF television about media reports on possible plans by May to negotiate a bilateral deal with the Irish government, Maas said it was unclear how it would work.
""We have to negotiate and also agree a withdrawal agreement with Britain. It is a bit of a mystery to me what the British government wants to negotiate with Dublin or what sort of an additional agreement it should be,"" he told German television.
""It won't have any effect on what was agreed with the (European) Commission."" 
The Sunday Times reported that May was seeking a bilateral treaty with Ireland to remove the contentious backstop arrangement that the EU insists on to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
Maas also said it would be ""very difficult"" to renegotiate Britain's withdrawal agreement with the EU.
""All 27 members must agree. In the last few days there have been relatively clear statements that there are many who are not ready to and there are some that are open to it. We have to wait to see what the Britons suggest,"" he said.
In an interview with Monday's edition of Die Welt daily, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a pro-European, said it was pointless for the EU to make concessions to Britain.
""Even if the EU moves away from the backstop and gives up the position of the Irish government, which I don't think will happen, even that wouldn't save the deal,"" he said, adding he put the risk of a no-deal Brexit at just 10 percent.
Like the EU as a whole, Germany does not want a no-deal Brexit but it has plans in place just in case.
The DIHK Chambers of Commerce, a body that represents German businesses, also argued that the EU should not offer Britain concessions.

""If we move towards the Britons further, the integrity of the internal market will be at stake and this is not negotiable from the point of view of German industry,"" Volker Treier, foreign trade chief of the DIHK, told Tagesspiegel.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>",Thousands of Colombians march against violence after deadly car bomb,"By Steven Grattan and Luis Jaime Acosta
BOGOTA (Reuters) - White flags and balloons filled streets nationwide as thousands of Colombians marched on Sunday to express outrage at violence after a car bomb blamed by the government on ELN rebels killed 20 police cadets and injured dozens.
President Ivan Duque and other political leaders hugged police officials on route to Bogota's main Bolivar Square (NYSE:SQ) as tearful protesters chanted ""no more terrorism"" and handed flowers to security personnel.
In last Thursday's attack, the deadliest in 16 years, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV carrying about 80 kilograms (176 lbs) of high explosive pentolite, broke through checkpoints onto the grounds of the General Santander (MC:SAN) School in the capital before it detonated, also damaging hundreds of apartments nearby. 
Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group has been blamed for the attack, prompting Duque to request Havana capture and extradite 10 rebel commanders in Cuba for peace talks.
The driver of the car, ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas, was also killed in the blast, authorities said.
On Sunday, police officers lined the streets emotionally overwhelmed by the flood of support for their fallen comrades, cadets between 18 and 23 years old.
""It fills my heart to see so many marching and supporting us,"" said a tearful Javier Sosa, dressed in olive green uniform. 
Nuns holding white daisies and handkerchiefs marched alongside police singing ""a united Colombia will never be defeated.""
The bombing has heightened fears that a new wave of attacks had been launched in the Andean nation as a reaction to the right-wing president's stance. 
Duque, who took office in August, pledged during his election campaign to toughen the fight against the group and drug-trafficking crime gangs that kill and kidnap civilians.
""This is a symbol of patriotism, public spirit and union,"" Duque told Reuters as he marched. 
""Today we're here as ordinary citizens to reject terrorism and violence. We're honoring the memory of those heroes, of those boys who were vilely murdered.""
The ELN, formed by radical Catholic priests in 1964, has not claimed responsibility or issued a public statement, but Duque's demand to arrest its peace negotiators makes it almost impossible for talks to restart.
Cuba has sidestepped Duque's request and said it will abide by the rules set out before talks began. 
The negotiation protocols provide security guarantees for guerrilla leaders to return to Colombia and protection from military attacks for an agreed period.
Composed of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, the ELN began peace talks with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos in early 2017, but they were suspended by Duque until the group frees its hostages and stops attacks.
The latest incident was the deadliest car bomb attack since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) attacked Bogota's upmarket El Nogal social club in 2003, killing 36.

Car bombs were frequently used during decades of civil war but the worst of the violence, which killed some 260,000, ended in 2016 when peace was signed with FARC.

Akel’s family has denied the allegations against him.
The U.S. ambassador to Israel called in November for Akel to be released, after he was first detained.
The Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and is a rival to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, said releasing Akel was a ""grave crime"".

DOHA (Reuters) - A third Qatari cash donation for impoverished Gaza civil servants will be made this week after it was held back by Israel in protest at Palestinian border violence, a Qatari diplomat said on Sunday.
Qatar in November began a six-month, $150 million program to fund civil servant wages and shipments of fuel for power generation in Gaza, offering a measure of reprieve to the blockaded enclave under the control of Islamist militant group Hamas.
Qatar hopes the aid will ease conditions and restore stability, part of efforts to bolster its international standing amid a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf neighbors.
Speaking from his office in Doha, Mohammed Al-Emadi, head of Qatar's Gaza Strip Reconstruction Committee, said the latest $15 million wage payment was initially withheld by Israel but would now arrive on Wednesday.
""Due to the violence on the border, the Israeli government postponed it. The agreement is subject to there not being too much violence, so last Friday they (Israel) approved to do the third tranche,"" Emadi told Reuters.
Gaza's health ministry has said more than 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since March at border protests demanding an end to an Israeli-led blockade of the coastal strip. 
Emadi said wage payments would not be physically carried by him in cash into Gaza as with previous disbursements but that a new system had been arranged. He declined to specify how it would work.
Cogat, the Israeli government agency coordinating the Gaza aid, declined to comment.
Emadi said Qatar would next push for a roughly $80 million electricity project that would have it effectively manage the strip's power supply, buying Israeli electricity in bulk and distributing it across Gaza while collecting payment from Palestinians in return.
""We will fund this project but I want to make sure I have control of the electricity so I can get my money back,"" he said of the plan, which would see Qatar build a power substation and network to end the need for costly fuel shipments.
""We need to find a solution for these 2 million people - this is our aim and goal. Not just to deliver money because Israel wants quiet or Hamas wants money.""

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Senator Graham urges Trump to meet Pakistan PM Khan,"By James Mackenzie
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Sunday President Donald Trump should meet Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as soon as possible to reset long-difficult U.S. relations with Pakistan and push for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.
The comments, which add to growing signs of improved relations between Islamabad and Washington, come amid efforts to press on with talks between the Taliban and the United States aimed at an agreement to end 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
""I've seen things change here and all in a positive direction,"" Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has generally been a staunch supporter of Trump, told a news conference in Islamabad. 
He said a meeting with Khan, who has declared strong support for a peace agreement in Afghanistan, would leave Trump ""far more enthusiastic about the region than he is today"".
""With Prime Minister Khan we have a unique opportunity to change our relationship,"" he said. A previously transactional relationship, based on rewards for services rendered, should be replaced by ""strategic engagement"", including a free trade agreement, he said. 
U.S. relations with Pakistan have long been dogged by suspicions that elements in the Pakistani establishment were aiding the Taliban, a charge Islamabad strongly denies. However, relations have appeared to improve in recent months amid efforts to push the Taliban towards a peace deal.
Trump, who has in the past argued for the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan, has made it clear he wants to see a peace accord reached rapidly although the Taliban have so far refused to talk directly with the Afghan government.
Graham's trip to Pakistan coincided with a visit by Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, and top military commanders including General Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command.
Khalilzad left Islamabad without announcing a new date for talks with Taliban representatives, who have refused further meetings until the U.S. side agrees to discuss a timetable for withdrawing its forces.
The uncertainty has been increased by reports that Trump is prepared to order more than 5,000 U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, a move that would represent a sharp change in course from Washington's previous policy of stepping up military action against the Taliban.
With Afghan forces suffering thousands of casualties a year and struggling to hold back the Taliban insurgency, the reports have caused alarm in Kabul, prompting many close to the government to question the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan.
Asked whether there had been confusion over the U.S. message, Graham, who has called for a Senate hearing on Trump's plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan, said ""without a doubt"" but added that he did not believe Washington would stand by and allow a Taliban victory.

""The world's not going to let the Taliban take Afghanistan over by force of arms. That would be unconscionable,"" he told Reuters. ""Any president who let that happen would go down in history very poorly.""

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 11:22AM ET</span>","After Westgate debacle, quick end to latest Kenyan attack shows progress","By Katharine Houreld and David Lewis
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The relatively swift end to an attack on a Nairobi hotel and office complex highlights improvements in Kenya's counterterrorism capabilities since Somali militants overran a shopping mall in the same neighborhood five years ago.
This time, the authorities flooded the area with elite units, including the paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) and its crack Recce squad, along with a new force trained by the United States to respond to emergencies at American facilities.
Still, the death toll might have been higher had it not been for the rapid intervention of some quick-thinking private security personnel before the government teams arrived en masse, security sources who took part in the operation said. 
Tuesday's two-pronged assault by a suicide bomber and at least four gunmen, claimed by the Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, killed 21 people and sent hundreds fleeing from the 14 Riverside Drive complex in the Kenyan capital.
However, the attack was over in 20 hours - a far cry from the four-day-long incident at Westgate shopping mall in 2013, which ended with 67 dead, some from friendly fire, and the Kenyan army going on a massive looting spree among the bodies.
When the government teams arrived this time, they were better prepared and more methodical in their approach – even if communication was sometimes shaky and it wasn't initially clear who was in charge, according to six security professionals, most of whom did not want to be identified for operational reasons.
Unlike in 2013, when foreign security professionals were quickly barred from the scene, Kenyan units worked closely with British and American special forces and private security professionals who were among the first to arrive.
""Involvement of the private security operators was crucial,"" said a security source in contact with local and international personnel at the complex. ""They delayed the attackers for just enough time to allow the government response to get into place.""
At the heart of the Kenyan response was a newly formed unit trained under the U.S. Special Program for Embassy Augmentation and Response (SPEAR), set up in 2014 to improve the ability of local forces to respond to emergencies at American facilities after a U.S. ambassador was killed in Benghazi, Libya.
SPEAR units are funded by diplomatic security and are also active in Chad, Iraq, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Tunisia and Mali, where they responded to an attack on a European Union office near the U.S. Embassy last year.
In Nairobi, SPEAR took charge as darkness fell, operating through the night with another team of five security professionals and medics until President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the next morning that all attackers had been killed.
""We took a lot of lessons from Westgate,"" said Joe Mucheru, Kenya's information minister. ""This was a multi-agency approach and response.""
SUICIDE BOMBER
    Tuesday's lunchtime crowd had largely thinned out at the Secret Garden restaurant in the complex when a young man dressed in black wandered down a pink stone path nearby at nearly 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT)
He stood outside the restaurant for nearly a minute. Waiters walked around him, and a passer-by heard him repeating, ""Where are you?"" in Swahili, presumably into a phone, a security professional said.
Then the man exploded with such force his limbs were scattered 50 meters apart, a sign he may have been wearing a professionally made suicide vest, two security professionals said. If so, it would be the first suicide attack in Kenya since a 1998 truck bombing at the U.S. Embassy killed 213 people.
Moments later, four men in black shot their way through the front gate of the complex, set three cars ablaze and then split into two teams, CCTV showed.
One private security professional who was already inside the complex called a friend, lighting up the phones of a tight-knit community: Americans, Britons, Israelis and Kenyans who work in the security industry. Many rushed to the scene with body armor and weapons at the ready.
Serge Medic, a Swiss national who owns a security firm, was one of the first to arrive along with a Kenyan man, identified by another security professional as a senior counterterrorism officer in civilian clothes, and an unidentified Kenyan man.
All were armed.
They advanced together until they came under fire, Medic said. As they retreated, they saw the distinctive red berets of the GSU, often deployed to quell riots. Medic worked with some colleagues and two GSU members to clear an office block.
'ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS'
Around the same time, a member of British security firm Halliday Finch was creeping down a riverbed at the back of the complex. As he drew near, he saw six bodies on a footbridge and a man struggling to help a woman shot in the leg.
The man, fearful of being overheard, gestured that two attackers were in the complex. The Halliday Finch employee entered cautiously, carrying rope that a friend had requested to make a zip line to evacuate people trapped on an upper floor of an office block.
Then the gunmen opened fire. Someone in the houses on the other side of the river must have been carrying out surveillance for them, the Halliday Finch man said. That's when eight GSU members showed up, he said.
""They had no senior officer, so they embedded into my mission,"" he said. ""They were absolutely fearless. When I said there was a terrorist just the other side of the wall, they said, 'Then let's take them'. I had to hold them back.""
These actions, security sources said, allowed civilians to flee and denied the militants room to maneuver in the initial stages of the attack. Some security experts believe the gunmen intended to take hostages and force a drawn-out siege. 
Instead, they entered buildings housing the offices of international companies, shooting at elevators and dropping grenades down stairwells before some holed up on the upper floors of the dusitD2 hotel to take pot shots at those fleeing below, a security official said.
PLAN IS FIRST CASUALTY
More units arrived, along with the Kenyan Red Cross, whose medics ran crouching under fire to evacuate victims on stretchers. Helicopters circled overhead.
Two black armored cars from the U.S. Embassy roared into the complex at about 5 p.m. and were used to help shield office workers fleeing from the militants' fire.
The evacuation of the complex was complicated by security systems that required a key card to open many doors, and by locked fire escapes in at least one building. Kenyan special forces used small charges to breach locked doors and gradually clear each floor, another security professional said.
Some of the Kenyan units had radios, but not all. At one point, a police officer threw scribbled notes out of a window to colleagues seven floors below, a witness said.
At another point, an officer trying to get intelligence from a helicopter ran out of credit on his phone and had to get more sent from his headquarters.
Three security professionals told Reuters they saw no evidence of a command post, though another said he heard one that had been set up in a building outside the complex.
Civilians were escorted out through the front gate and directed to neighboring university grounds. Once there, no one took down phone numbers or obtained statements to identify who had seen the attackers, one witness said. No one was searched until after the third building was cleared.
But the security official said observers shouldn't be too harsh. Some solutions may have been ad hoc, but they worked.

""The first casualty of contact is always your plan,"" he said. ""The key is for the Kenyans to improve their tactics, techniques and procedures ... They need specialized units for this.""

Seeking to rebuild ties with Africa damaged by the occupation of Palestinian territories in the 1967 Middle East war, Israel said in November that diplomatic links with Chad would be revived after President Idriss Deby paid the first official visit to Jerusalem by a Chadian leader. 
Speaking at a joint press event, Netanyahu said recent attacks by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency and a militant attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, last week showed the need to cooperate on security.
""The game is far from lost if we pull together,"" Netanyahu said. ""We are happy to know that a Muslim-majority country is connected through diplomatic ties to Israel.""
Deby echoed Netanyahu's call for closer cooperation: ""I note with satisfaction our shared view on the need to combine forces to tackle terrorism, which spares no country.""
They said security had been a key topic of discussion during an earlier meeting, but gave no details. Last year a source told Reuters Israel had supplied Chad's army with weapons and equipment to help fight rebels. 

Netanyahu has previously cited Chad’s renewed relationship with his country as an example of how Israel can make diplomatic inroads in Africa and the Middle East despite its conflict with the Palestinians.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Roaring along Baghdad's highways, the ""Iraq Bikers"" are doing more than showing off their love of outsized motorcycles and black leather: they want their shared enthusiasm to help heal Iraq's deep sectarian rifts. 
Weaving in and out of traffic, only the lucky few ride Harley Davidsons - a rare and expensive brand in Iraq - while others make do with bikes pimped-up to look something like the ""Easy Rider"" dream machines.
""Our goal is to build a brotherhood,"" said Bilal al-Bayati, 42, a government employee who founded the club in 2012 with the aim of improving the image of biker gangs and to promote unity after years of sectarian conflict. 
That is why the first rule of his bikers club is: you do not talk about politics.
""It is absolutely prohibited to talk politics among members,"" Bayati told Reuters as he sat with fellow bikers in a shisha cafe, a regular hangout for members.
""Whenever politics is mentioned, the members are warned once or twice and then expelled. We no longer have the strength to endure these tragedies or to repeat them,"" he said, referring to sectarian violence.
With his black bandana and goatee, the leader of the Baghdad pack, known as ""Captain"", looks the epitome of the American biker-outlaw. 
But while their style is unmistakably U.S.-inspired - at least one of Bayati's cohorts wears a helmet emblazoned with the stars and stripes - these bikers fly the Iraqi flag from the panniers of their machines.
The Iraq Bikers - who now number 380 - are men of all ages, social classes and various faiths. One of their most recent events was taking party in Army Day celebrations.
Some are in the military, the police and even the Popular Mobilization Forces, a grouping of mostly Shi'ite militias which have taken part in the fight to oust Islamic State from Iraq in the last three years. 
""It is a miniature Iraq,"" said member Ahmed Haidar, 36, who works with an international relief agency.
But riding a chopper through Baghdad is quite different from Route 101. The bikers have to slow down at the many military checkpoints set up around the city to deter suicide and car bomb attacks.
And very few can afford a top bike.
""We don't have a Harley Davidson franchise here,"" said Kadhim Naji, a mechanic who specializes in turning ordinary motorbikes into something special.
""So what we do is we alter the motorbike, so it looks similar ... and it is cheaper.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters outside parliament on Sunday as tens of thousands of Greeks rallied in Athens to protest against a name deal with Macedonia.
Central Athens turned into a sea of people holding blue and white Greek flags as thousands came from all over the country to rally against the accord to name the ex-Yugoslav state North Macedonia.
Many Greeks believe the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over their country's own northern region of that name. 
The issue evokes strong emotions among Greeks who consider Macedonia, the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, to be an integral part of their homeland and heritage.
The accord, signed by the two governments, unblocks the ex-Yugoslav republic's desire to join NATO and the European Union once ratified by Greece's parliament.
""We cannot stomach this deal, to give away our Macedonia, our history,"" said pensioner Amalia Savrami, 67, as she waved a large Greek flag on Athens's Syntagma Square (NYSE:SQ). 
""Macedonia is Greek, period."" 
Locals said the Athens rally was the largest in decades, easily outdoing rallies against austerity in previous years.
Macedonia declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the break-up of Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has sought to accelerate the country's bid to join the EU and NATO and to work on resolving the decades-old name dispute with Greece.
Greece had agreed that until the name dispute is resolved, its northern neighbor, with a population of about 2 million, could be referred to internationally as ""FYROM"" - Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That is the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993.
Settling the issue would be hailed as a success by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose left-right coalition came to power in 2015. He won a confidence motion this month after the junior partner in his coalition pulled out.
The agreement with Skopje had strained relations with the right-wing Independent Greeks party, his coalition ally, which objected to the use of Macedonia in any agreed name.

The identity of the attackers was not immediately clear. U.N. peacekeeping and French forces are stationed in northern Mali to combat well-armed jihadist groups seen as the gravest threat to security across Africa's Sahel region.
The clash near Aguelhok occurred early on Sunday following an attack ""by assailants in many armed vehicles,"" the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali (MINUSMA) said in a statement.
It said peacekeepers had thwarted the attack, but eight died and several were wounded. The mission's chief Mahamat Saleh Annadif demanded ""a robust, swift and concerted response.""
A 2015 peace deal signed by Mali’s government and separatist groups has failed to end the violence. Islamists have also staged assaults on high-profile targets in the capital, Bamako, and in neighboring Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.
French forces intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive back fighters who had hijacked a Tuareg uprising a year earlier, and some 4,000 French troops remain there. The U.N. Security Council then deployed peacekeepers, which have been targets of a concerted guerrilla campaign.

LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - Two men were arrested early on Sunday over a car bomb attack in Northern Ireland's Londonderry and police were looking into whether the New IRA militant group was responsible, officers said.
The men in their twenties were detained hours after the explosion on Saturday evening outside the city's courthouse, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told a news conference.
""Fortunately it didn't kill anybody but clearly it was a very significant attempt to kill people here in this community,"" he said.
Hamilton said the main focus of the investigation was on the New IRA - one of a small number of groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. They have carried out sporadic attacks in recent years.
Saturday's blast came at a time when police in both Northern Ireland and European Union-member Ireland have been warning that a return to a hard border between the two after Brexit, complete with customs and other checks, could be a target for militant groups.
Politicians from all sides - including Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the nationalist Irish Republican Army (IRA) - condemned the explosion.
""SHAME ON YOU""
""Shame on you. Shame on you and stop,"" said Mary Lou McDonald, leader of Sinn Fein which signed the peace agreement. She told BBC Northern Ireland that the blast was an ""outrageous attack"".
The Northern Ireland police force said it was just given minutes to evacuate children and hundreds of hotel guests before the explosion of what they described as a highly unstable, crude device that could have detonated at any time.
Officers on patrol spotted a suspicious vehicle at the scene at about 1955 GMT, then received a warning five minutes later that a device had been left there, the force said.
""We moved immediately to begin evacuating people from nearby buildings including hundreds of hotel guests, 150 people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Hamilton in an earlier statement.
The pizza delivery vehicle was completely destroyed by the blast just ten minutes after that. The van had been hijacked nearby by two armed men around two hours earlier, police said. Nobody was injured in the explosion.
Hamilton said he thought the attack marked a continuation of militants' campaigns, rather than an escalation.
""The New IRA, like most dissident republican groups in Northern Ireland, are small, largely unrepresentative, and just determined to drag people back to somewhere they don’t want to be,"" he said.
The last fatal attack involving a car bomb was carried out in 2016 by the New IRA when a prison officer was fatally injured by a bomb left under his van in Belfast.
About 3,600 people were killed in the conflict that was fought between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and predominantly Catholic nationalists.

""There is no doubt that in terms of the Brexit element, there will be a section within our communities who will want to exploit that and use that to further their own objectives but I wouldn't put that as the sole purpose,"" Gary Middleton, a local Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member of Northern Ireland's devolved government told Reuters at the scene.

LONDON (Reuters) - Parliament cannot be allowed to hijack Brexit, Trade Minister Liam Fox said on Sunday, in a warning to lawmakers who want to take more control over Britain's departure from the European Union.
With just weeks to go before Britain is due to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May will return to parliament on Monday to set out how she plans to try to break the Brexit deadlock after her deal was rejected by lawmakers last week.
She will also speak to ministers on Sunday on a conference call, a government source said, as the prime minister tries to navigate a way through the competing visions for the future from a second referendum to staying in the EU.
Time is running out for Brexit, Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, but so far there is little that unites a divided parliament beyond its rejection of May's deal that envisages close economic ties with the EU.
Britain's main opposition Labour Party is pressing for a new election and for May to rule out the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, while others in parliament are lobbying for anything from a second referendum to leaving without an agreement.
Fox, a Brexit supporter, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that May's divorce agreement with the EU was still the best basis for a deal and warned lawmakers against trying to take more control of Britain's departure.
""Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process because parliament said to the people of this country: 'we make a contract with you, you will make the decision and we will honor it',"" Fox said.
""What we are now getting are some of those who were always absolutely opposed to the result of the referendum trying to hijack Brexit and in effect steal the result from the people.""
Britain voted with a 52 percent majority to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum that exposed deep divisions across the country, divisions that still split cities and towns, and the country's parliament, almost three years on.
DEADLOCK
After seeing her deal rejected by more than 200 lawmakers last week, May has opened talks with other parties to try to find a way to break the deadlock. 
But with Labour refusing to take part until May rules out leaving without a deal, some lawmakers fear those talks will change little and instead have said they will launch attempts next week to force the government to change course.
Several are trying to make sure Britain does not ""accidentally"" leave without a deal on March 29, a scenario some businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy.
""What happens when you have a hung parliament is that power does pass from government ... to parliament and that's what we are seeing play out,"" Nicky Morgan, a Conservative former minister, told Sky News.
She said she was backing a bill that would force the government to extend Article 50, which triggered Britain's two-year talks to leave the EU, if it cannot get an agreement approved by parliament by the end of February.
Dominic Grieve, another Conservative lawmaker, is also looking at ways to stop Britain from leaving without a deal.
With much of the focus now on Labour, its Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said there was now only really two options that could find majority support - a future close economic relationship with the EU or a second referendum - and that it was increasingly inevitable that Article 50 would be extended.
""We've arrived at phase three and therefore we need to be realistic about what the options are,"" Starmer told the BBC. 

""Let's ... reduce it to the options that are at least capable of getting a majority and that is a close economic relationship and a public vote.""

Aoun told an Arab economic summit in Beirut that Lebanon had proposed solutions for safe returns for the meeting to agree on.
Since conflict broke out in Syria in 2011, more than 1 million people have fled across the border to Lebanon, where aid agencies say most refugees live in extreme poverty. 
The United Nations says conditions are not yet in place for safe returns. Rights groups have warned against forced returns while a Syrian peace deal remains elusive, and refugees often say they fear conscription into the army.
""Lebanon calls on the international community to make all efforts possible and provide suitable conditions for a safe return of displaced Syrians... without linking that with reaching a political solution,"" Aoun said.
He also proposed creating an Arab bank for reconstruction and development ""to help all affected Arab states overcome adversity and contribute to their sustainable economic growth."" 
A key point of contention ahead of the summit has been whether to bring Syria back into the Arab League, more than seven years after its membership was suspended.
Lebanese officials have stepped up calls for refugees to leave the country now that Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has reclaimed most of the country with Russian and Iranian help.
Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah, which fights alongside Assad, and its political allies including Aoun have urged rapprochement with Damascus. Other politicians oppose this, insisting the United Nations must oversee any repatriations.
Under deals Hezbollah has helped broker, tens of thousands of refugees have left Lebanon for Syria in the past year - a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the refugee crisis.
Some 5.6 million Syrian refugees remain in five neighboring countries - Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq - the U.N. refugee agency said last month.

Key obstacles to their return include documentation, landmines, and the absence of amnesties for people who deserted the army, it said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday entered the 2019 presidential race after forging an alliance with a staunch critic to challenge his former governing partners at a time when the Taliban has shut him out of talks to end more than 17 years of war.
Ghani, 69, is seeking a second term amid the war with the hardline Islamic militants and ongoing peace talks between the United States and the Taliban, in which his government complains it has been sidelined.
On Sunday Ghani registered as a presidential candidate for the July election, facing competition from his one-time officials who have formed new alliances.
Independent analysts said Afghanistan's political landscape has been thrown into turmoil by the nominations and shifting loyalties.
A day earlier former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar announced he was running for president, with the Afghanistan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, who currently holds a power-sharing agreement with Ghani, formally entering the race on Sunday morning.
In a televised announcement, President Ghani, accompanied by his wife and political allies, listed his National Unity government's achievements during the five-year term, including his consistent offer to hold unconditional peace talks with the Taliban.
""I started the peace initiative and our team will bring stable and long-lasting peace to the country,"" he said, adding that if the Taliban consider themselves Afghans they ""should come and talk to us"". 
Ghani's critics say the previous presidential election in 2014 was fraught with irregularities, but the American government backed the Western-educated leader to rule the country while Washington wound down the U.S. military presence in favor of an advisory role to Afghan forces in the war. 
But in the past four years, Western diplomats said they found Ghani to be an unrealistic micromanager who had failed to assess the security crisis or build political consensus to govern far-flung provinces. 
The Taliban, has steadily carved out territorial gains since 2014, leaving Ghani's government in control of less than two thirds of the country. Islamic State also has an established presence in the east of the country. 
Suicide attacks targeting Afghan forces, government officials and expatriates have not subsided.
Last year Washington appointed Afghan-born diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad to start direct peace talks with the Taliban. Khalilzad has met Taliban leaders at least three times but disagreement over the agenda and the Taliban's refusal to meet representatives from Ghani's government has stalled the talks in recent weeks.
""Ghani could have made a dignified exit from politics and committed himself to the peace process, but instead he has formed an alliance with his main opponent to secure a second term,"" said one Western diplomat in Kabul, asking to remain anonymous. 
On Saturday Interior Minister Amrullah Saleh stepped down from his position to join the Ghani's team as a vice-presidential candidate. Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, had appointed Saleh, once seen as a significant rival, in an effort to neutralize his political opponents and shore up support from Afghanistan's ethnic Tajiks, among whom Saleh commands strong backing.
""The most fundamental shift in Kabul politics recently has been the muddying of the waters during the presidential candidate nominations,"" said Graeme Smith, a consultant for the International Crisis Group
Smith said the rural-urban divide in which major cities favored Ghani while his opponents received backing from provincial strongholds had been eroded. ""Those clear lines have been blurred,"" he said.

Senior electoral officials, who have been accused of failing to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections last year, said they are committed to stick to the deadline but the security situation could force them to delay polls by two months.

HARARE (Reuters) - A crackdown last week on protests in Zimbabwe is a foretaste of how the government will respond to future unrest, the president's spokesman said, fuelling concerns that the country is reverting to authoritarian rule.
Police say three people died during protests over fuel price hikes in Harare's capital and second city Bulawayo that turned violent. But human rights groups say evidence suggests at least a dozen people were killed while scores were treated for gunshot wounds.
""(The) government will not stand by while such narrow interests play out so violently. The response so far is just a foretaste of things to come,"" said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's spokesman George Charamba.
Charamba told the state-controlled Sunday Mail newspaper the government would review some provisions of the constitution adopted in 2013, which he said were being abused by proponents of democracy.
Lawyers and activists say hundreds of Zimbabweans were detained last week accused of public order offences, including at least four lawmakers from the opposition MDC party and Evan Mawarire, a pastor who rose to prominence as a critic of former leader Robert Mugabe critic and led a national shutdown in 2016.
Local rights groups say security forces, accused of night raids at homes of suspected protesters, are now trying to track down people who have gone into hiding. 
A partial internet blackout was still in force on Sunday, two days after mobile networks sent messages to customers saying they had been ordered to keep social media sites shut until further notice.
When he was elected in July, Mnangagwa promised a clean break with the 37-year rule of Mugabe, who used the security forces to quell civilian protests before being forced out in a de facto coup in November 2017.
But the MDC says former Mugabe ally Mnangagwa is now overseeing a reversion to authoritarian rule by using the same tactic.
Charamba, who is on an official trip with Mnangagwa to Azerbaijan, said the MDC leadership and affiliate organizations would be ""held fully accountable for the violence and the looting."" The MDC denies fomenting unrest. 
U.N. rights officials denounced last week's crackdown, while an independent inquiry found that the army used excessive force when it stepped in to stop post-election violence last August, during which six people were shot dead.
Zimbabweans, who have seen their purchasing power eroded by soaring inflation, also say Mnangagwa has not delivered on pre-election pledges to kick-start economic growth after Mugabe's exit.

The blast came on the anniversary of Operation Olive Branch, an air and ground assault launched by Turkey in 2018 on the mainly-Kurdish Afrin to drive out the Syrian Kurdish YPG, which it sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged an insurgency on Turkish soil since 1984.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
It follows a blast on Wednesday in Manbij, a northern Syrian town controlled by a militia allied with U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, claimed by Islamic State, which killed two U.S. troops and two civilians working for the U.S. military.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan announced last month that his army would launch an operation against the YPG east of the Euphrates. U.S. President Donald Trump later announced a decision to pull out of Syria, alarming allied Kurdish leaders who run much of the north.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella group dominated by the YPG and Washington's main Syrian partner in the fight against Islamic State, controls territory in northeast and eastern Syria, which makes up about a quarter of the country.
The U.S. decision to leave Syria led the Kurdish leaders to urge Russia and its ally Damascus to send forces to shield the border from the threat of the Turkish offensive.
Turkey's state-owned Anadolu Agency said two bombs hit Afrin's city center, one exploding on a bus and the second in a garbage container.

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said its warplanes attacked seven military facilities used for drone operations in Sanaa, which is held by rival Houthi forces.
Yemen's nearly four-year-old civil war, which pits the Iran-aligned Houthi movement against the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi, has killed tens of thousands and left millions on the brink of starvation.
Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said the overnight targets included al-Dulaimi Air Base, a drone storage site, and military training sites.
Medical workers and residents told Reuters at least two civilians were killed, and others injured, and that the raids also damaged homes.
Houthi-run al-Masirah TV said on Sunday that the coalition had conducted 24 air strikes on Sanaa since Saturday evening, including four on the air base. It said a plastics factory was also hit, causing a large fire.
Reuters footage showed a large crater next to the factory, and damaged homes nearby. 
""The raids were very violent, the likes of which we have not seen for a year,"" Sanaa resident Arwa Abdul Karim told Reuters. ""The house shook so much we thought it would fall on our heads."" 
FRAGILE TRUCE HOLDS IN HODEIDAH
The escalation in fighting, which follows a deadly Houthi drone attack last week on a Yemeni government military parade, augurs badly for a second round of U.N.-sponsored talks this month aimed at ending the war.
Hadi was ousted from power in 2014, and the Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in 2015 to try to reinstate him.
The United Nations is trying to implement a ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement in the port city of Hodeidah, the main entry point for most of Yemen's imports and aid.
In the first significant breakthrough in peace efforts, a deal was reached in talks in Sweden last month to avert a full-scale assault on the port.
The truce has largely held in Hodeidah, which is controlled by the Houthis with thousands of coalition-backed forces massed on the outskirts. But the withdrawal of forces by both sides has stalled over disagreements over who would control the Red Sea city.
Rights groups have criticized the coalition for air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets since 2015. They also criticize the Houthis for missile attacks on Saudi cities, including the capital Riyadh.
Western nations, including some which supply the coalition with arms and intelligence, have pressed Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to end the conflict that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran. The Houthis deny receiving any help from Iran and say their revolution is against corruption.

Shahpoor Ahmadzai, the spokesman for Logar's provincial police, said the bomber detonated an explosives-packed car close to the governor's convoy on a major highway between Logar and the capital Kabul.
""Unfortunately 10 others are wounded, and the number of casualties may rise"" Ahmadzai said, adding that the provincial chief of the country's intelligence agency was also in the convoy but unhurt in the attack.
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said in a statement that the group was responsible for the blast and that a ""large number"" of Afghan special forces had been killed or wounded.
Logar, located around 75 kms (46 miles) from Kabul, is known as a strategic gateway to the capital and is vulnerable to attacks due to the Taliban's active presence in most areas of the province.
The militant group have ramped up attacks in strategic provinces in recent months in their battle to expel foreign forces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law, even as peace talks with the United States ramp up.

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Dozens of families displaced from their homes in the northern province of Sar-e Pul by Taliban pressure have arrived in the provincial capital, as the insurgents have tightened their grip around the city, residents and officials said.
    Taliban fighters have been threatening oil fields around the city of Sar-e Pul as they have stepped up operations with the apparent aim of strengthening their position during peace talks with U.S. officials.
    ""In general, the security situation in Sar-e Pul province has been in critical condition and the Taliban are trying to carry out their attacks on the districts close to the city,"" said Zabiullah Amani, spokesman for the governor of Sar-e Pul.
    The fighting comes as peace talks between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives have stalled over the insurgents' demand to focus the agenda for peace talks on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.
    The increasingly confident Taliban now control broad swathes of the countryside outside the main cities of Afghanistan and have set their stamp ever more clearly on areas under their control as government forces struggle to push them back.
    In Sar-e Pul, officials said around 40 families had arrived in the provincial capital from Kohistan, an isolated district firmly under Taliban control, and have mostly been seeking shelter from the freezing winter temperatures in city mosques.
    With punishing winter temperatures making life a misery for displaced people, little help has come from the government.
    ""These families are now in the center of the city of Sar-e Pul and are in a very bad state because they do not have any kind of living materials,"" Amani said.
    Accounts from the displaced families suggest the Taliban singled out families believed to have sympathies with the government or family members in the police and expelled them.
   Haji Azizullah, an elder who oversaw the transfer of displaced families from Kohistan district, said those driven from their homes were all suspected of being close to the military or the security forces.
    ""The Taliban told us to either take your children and work together with the Taliban under our authority or move you out of this area,"" he said.
    With the Taliban still refusing to talk directly with the Afghan government, the pressure on families on the opposing side points to some of the likely problems in any post-settlement Afghanistan after more than 17 years of war.
    Saber, a resident of Kohistan who left the district with her six children last week, said Taliban had approached her a week ago and told her to bring her son, a member of the Afghan Local Police, in to them.
    ""When I refused, four people from the Taliban came yesterday and told me I had to get out of the area,"" she said.
The Taliban spokesman was not immediately for comment.

Newspapers showed pictures of Philip driving a replacement Land Rover on Saturday at the royals' Sandringham residence in Norfolk. He did not appear to be using a seat belt while traveling on a public road.
""We are aware of the photographs,"" a police spokesman said. ""Suitable words of advice have been given to the driver and this is in line with our standard response when being made aware of our receiving such images showing this type of offence.""

The marches, part of the Women's March rallies held around the world in support of women's rights, gathered some 3,000 people in Sydney, who in their chants demanded safe streets for women in Australian cities.
Aiia Maasarwe, 21, was killed when walking home after a night out with friends in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, earlier this week. A 20-year-old man was charged with her murder.
Maasarwe's death recharged outrage over violence against women after 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon was killed in Melbourne while walking home after performing at a comedy show in June.
Thousands of people gathered at vigils for Maasarwe on Friday and continued to lay flowers at the site of her death. A special tram carrying only flowers late on Friday followed the route of Maasarwe's final journey.
In Sydney on Sunday marchers held signs paying tribute to Maasarwe and other victims of violence. Television news showed women carrying signs: ""For Aiia and for those who suffer silently"" and ""I wanna walk through the park in the dark"".
""I don't want my daughter to grow up in a world where she's unsafe or she can't pursue the opportunities she wants and I march for my son because I don't want him to grow up in a world where toxic masculinity is acceptable,"" said Samantha Nolan-Smith, one of several hundred protesters in the Australian capital Canberra, reported Australian Broadcasting Corp.

In reaction to Maasarwe's death, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government would announce another ""action plan"" to stem violence against women ahead of an election expected by May, on top of A$350 million ($252 million) that has already been committed.

LA SERENA (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.7 earthquake hit the coast of north-central Chile on Saturday evening, the U.S. Geological Survey said, and witnesses said it rattled buildings farther south in the capital city of Santiago but left only minor damage in its wake. 
The quake struck at 10:32 p.m. local time (0132 GMT) about 15.6 km (9.7 miles) south-southwest of Coquimbo, the USGS said. The quake was 53 km (33 miles) below the surface, a relatively shallow tremor that shook homes and had some worried about a possible tsunami.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, however, quickly discarded a tsunami threat following the tremor.
A Reuters witness reported minor damage to older buildings and power outages in the nearby coastal city of La Serena, a popular beach town about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Santiago.
""It felt very strong...the tourists were very nervous, but nothing serious happened,"" Camila Castillo, a receptionist at a hotel in La Serena, told Reuters.
Chilean miner  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc said operations were normal at its Los Pelambres copper mine following the nearby earthquake. 
Chile, located on the so-called “Pacific Ring of Fire,” has a long history of deadly quakes, including a 8.8 magnitude quake in 2010 off the south-central coast, which also triggered a tsunami that devastated coastal towns.

But death and destruction are limited by strict construction codes especially designed to withstand earthquakes.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2019 12:46AM ET</span>",From pariah to demi-god: transgender leader a star at massive Indian festival,"By Alasdair Pal
PRAYAGRAJ, India (Reuters) - In a desert tent guarded by armed police and a thick-set bouncer, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi is blessing a constant stream of pilgrims, who garland her with marigolds and kneel to touch her feet.
Tripathi, a tattooed transgender leader and a former reality TV star, has become an unlikely icon at India's Kumbh Mela, a huge religious festival being held on the banks of the Ganges river in the city of Prayagraj. Up to 150 million people are expected to attend by the time the festival ends in March. 
On Tuesday, her religious movement, called the Kinnar Akhada, became the first transgender group to bathe at the confluence of the holy Ganges and the Yamuna rivers on the first day of the ancient festival, traditionally reserved for reclusive Hindu priests, almost all of whom are men. 
""After centuries down the line, it was when the community finally got its due,"" Tripathi told Reuters, seated on a pedestal next to her Michael Kors bag, juggling calls on an iPhone. 
Many at the festival cheer Tripathi for reclaiming the lost place in Hinduism for India's ""third gender"", known as the hijras, worshipped as demi-gods for thousands of years, but ridiculed and sidelined during British colonial rule. 
A law passed in 1871 classed the hijras as ""criminals"". 
Little changed after independence and hijras were pariahs, living in tribes, begging or soliciting for sustenance and harassed by police.
It was only in 2014 that the Supreme Court officially recognized transgender people as a third gender. 
Tripathi is one of the best known. But her support for building a controversial Hindu temple on the site of a demolished mosque has angered some in the LGBT community, who allege she is courting support from India's powerful religious right to further her own influence. 
FALL AND RISE
The place of hijras in Indian culture dates back to the Ramayana, a more-than 2,000 year-old Hindu epic poem venerated and performed across India. 
In the text, the god-king Ram is exiled from the holy city of Ayodhya, with the entire kingdom following him into the forest. He orders them to turn back, but returning after 14 years, finds the hijras waiting for him in the same spot. Impressed by their devotion, he grants them the power to invoke blessings and curses on people. 
For centuries, though their lives were far from easy, hijras held a special role in India's royal courts, tasked with guarding harems and rising to influential positions. 
Today, despite their legal recognition, many still face prejudice in what is a conservative country, forced into sex work or seeking alms at weddings and births, a long-held practice among hijras. Hate crimes against them are common and HIV prevalence within the community is many times higher than the general population.
""The ritual seeking of alms is now seen as begging,"" said Anindya Hajra, a transgender activist at the Pratyay Gender Trust. ""It criminalizes and pushes an already vulnerable community to its very brink."" 
COLORFUL LIFE
Born in 1979 in Thane, a suburb of India's financial capital Mumbai, Tripathi says she had a difficult childhood scarred with abuse by a close relative. A sickly child who was bullied at school for being feminine, she grew in confidence after learning Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance. 
""I chose not to remember the prejudice,"" she said. ""Rather I think (about) the good things that have happened to me, and be a flamboyant rainbow.""
Long recognized as one of the most influential figures in the LGBT community in India, she become famous across the country when she appeared on reality TV show ""Bigg Boss"" in 2011. She was a petitioner in the landmark court ruling that recognized transgender people. 
In 2015, she founded her Akhara and began a campaign to have hijras represented at the at the first ""Shahi Snan"", or royal bath, of the Kumbh Mela. 
""It all started to reclaim the lost position in the dharma,"" Tripathi said, referring to the Hindu cosmic law underlying correct behavior and social order. ""I was not very religious until 2015 – life changed."" 
ANCIENT TRADITION
Devout Hindus believe bathing in the waters of the Ganges absolves people of sins and doing so at the time of the Kumbh Mela, or the ""festival of the pot"", brings salvation from the cycle of life and death. 
At the festival, 13 religious orders, or Akhara, set up camp on the banks of the Ganges. 
The umbrella body overseeing the Akharas initially refused to recognize the Kinnar Akhara as the 14th order.
But Tripathi has forged close bonds with the largest of the other holy orders at the Kumbh Mela, the Juna Akhara. They agreed to bathe together.
On the first royal bathing day on Tuesday, Tripathi rose at 4 a.m., dressed in a saffron sari and applied her makeup. She and her dozens of disciples then began the long procession to the river on a fleet of elaborately decorated trucks.
At the banks of the Ganges, they waited for their turn to bathe. Tripathi met with Hari Giri, the leader of Juna Akhara. 
Her Kinnar Akhara ""was there, is there, and will always be there"", Giri told Tripathi. 
Shortly after sunrise, she plunged into the waters, to the cheers of the crowds who gathered to watch.
DIVISIVE FIGURE
Tripathi has courted controversy with support for the building of a temple dedicated to Ram on the site of a former mosque in Ayodhya which was demolished by hardline Hindus in 1992, leading to riots in which thousands died.
Many Hindus claim the mosque was built over an ancient temple that marked the birthplace of Ram, and the row is expected to be a major issue in a general election due to be held in the country by May. Many activists of India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have been agitating for the construction of a temple at the site, alarming the country's sizeable Muslim minority. 
""There has been an attempt by the right to co-opt trans voices to suit a certain version of history,"" said Hajra, the activist. ""Our apprehension is also that some are trying to further (their) own personal career moves."" 
A letter signed in November by hundreds of transgender people and rights groups accused Tripathi of fuelling ""the right-wing politics of communal hatred"".
She is unrepentant.
""Where my Lord Ram was born, there the temple has to come,"" she said. The Mughals ""brought (the temple) down and then they enslaved us all"", she said, referring to the Muslim emperors who ruled India in the 16th and 17th century. 
Tripathi plans to spend the rest of the Kumbh festival at her Akhara, receiving visitors among her colorful band of followers, who have little in common with the holy men living monastic lives in the other camps. 

""We are not celibate,"" she said. ""We are demi-gods, not saints. We have our own rules.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo's constitutional court confirmed Felix Tshisekedi's presidential election win on Sunday, dismissing a challenge from another opposition leader who rejected the court's decision and declared himself president.
Second-placed Martin Fayulu accused Tshisekedi and the ruling party of stitching up the result. His move that risks stoking further unrest over the bitterly disputed poll.
Tshisekedi's supporters were celebrating the court decision in the streets of Kinshasa. Fayulu says the results were the product of a secret deal between Tshisekedi and outgoing President Joseph Kabila to cheat him out of a win of more than 60 percent.
Kabila's camp and Tshisekedi's denied making any such deal. The president of the constitutional court, Benoit Luamba, rejected the challenge as ""inadmissible.""
""The constitutional court has just confirmed that it serves a dictatorial regime ... by validating false results, (and enabling) a constitutional coup d'etat,"" Fayulu said in a statement.
The provisional results in the election, which was meant to enable Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence from Belgium, showed Tshisekedi winning with a slim margin over Fayulu. Kabila's favored candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary came in a distant third.
Government spokesman Lambert Mende welcomed the court's decision.
""Felix Tshisekedi will become the fifth president of the republic,"" Mende said by telephone.
A spokesman for Tshisekedi, Vidiye Tshimanga, said: ""We are happy that the voice of the Congolese people has been heard and that a true democratic and peaceful handover will occur.""
If Fayulu's supporters reject the result, it could worsen unrest that has already seen 34 people killed, 59 wounded and 241 ""arbitrary arrests"" in the past week, according to the U.N. human rights office. 
Congo's constitutional court is widely seen as beholden to Kabila, who has been in power since his father was assassinated in 2001. 
""SERIOUS DOUBTS""
Independent monitors have flagged major flaws, including faulty voting machines and polling stations at which many were unable to vote. The Catholic Church, which had a 40,000-strong team of observers, denounced the provisional result.
A tally from the church reviewed by Reuters from about 70 percent of polling stations suggested a victory of 62 percent for Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) country manager. Tshisekedi and Ramazani were virtually neck-and-neck second place with 16.93 percent and 16.88 percent, respectively.
The African Union (AU) called for final results to be postponed. The AU, which often sits on the fence when it comes to mediating internal conflicts of member countries, cited ""serious doubts"" about the election's credibility.
On Friday, Congo rejected the AU's request. 
Accusations of cheating are not new to elections in Congo, which was ruled by kleptocratic dictator Mobutu Sese Seko for 32 years before tumbling into chaos and war in the late 1990s. 
Foreign powers have overlooked alleged crookedness in past polls for the sake of stability in a country where two wars sucked in multiple African armies and killed millions. 
Congo's vast interior is a vital source of copper and other metals, including cobalt, used in electric car batteries and mobile phones. 
Yet the scale of the alleged rigging in December's election has stoked fears the vote could degenerate into renewed street fighting or another regional conflict.
The country of 80 million is one of the world's poorest, and the frustration and hardship in the slums of the capital Kinshasa quickly boils over into violence. 

However, most of the opposition to Kabila in the capital has been harnessed by the party of Tshisekedi, whose supporters are celebrating. His father Etienne Tshisekedi was a popular opposition figure before he died last year.

The Sunday Times said aides to May thought a deal with Ireland would remove the opposition to her Brexit plan from the Democratic Unionist Party that supports May's minority government and from pro-Brexit rebels in her Conservative Party.
However the Irish edition of the same newspaper quoted a senior Irish government source as saying the bilateral treaty proposal was ""not something we would entertain"" and a second senior political source as saying it would not work with the European Commission.
May suffered a heavy defeat in parliament on Tuesday when Conservative lawmakers and members of other parties rejected her Brexit plan by an overwhelming majority. 
That left Britain facing the prospect of no deal to smooth its exit from the EU in little more than two months' time.
May is due to announce on Monday how she plans to proceed.
Many Conservatives and the DUP oppose the backstop that the European Union insists on as a guarantee to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
No one was immediately available for comment on the Sunday Times report in May's office nor in the Irish government.
Earlier on Saturday, Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said Dublin's commitment to the Brexit divorce deal struck with the British government was ""absolute,"" including the border backstop arrangement.

The Sunday Times also said a group of lawmakers in Britain's parliament would meet on Sunday to consider ways they could suspend the Brexit process, wresting control away from May's government.

An image released by police on Twitter showed what appeared to be a burning vehicle in Bishop Street in the center of the city. Two local politicians said the suspected blast occurred outside the city's courthouse.
""This pointless act of terror must be condemned in the strongest terms. Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries,"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said on Twitter.
Her party colleague from the area, Gary Middleton, said the vehicle was hijacked, without citing a source. Northern Irish police gave no further details and said they were carrying out initial investigations.
A journalist from the Irish edition of the Sunday Times newspaper reported that the attack was carried out by the New IRA, a militant group opposed to the 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. 
Some 3,600 people were killed in the conflict that was fought between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and predominantly Catholic nationalists.
Some sporadic violence continues among small, splinter groups but car bombings are rare.
The new IRA was behind the last such fatal attack when in 2016 a prison officer was seriously injured when a bomb exploded under his van in Belfast. He later died from his injuries.
In Londonderry, police and fire officers came under petrol bomb and missile attack for a number of nights last July from Catholic youths in the Bogside area of the city around the time of annual parades that often raise tensions.
The reported bombing comes as police on both sides of the now-open border between Northern Ireland and European Union-member Ireland have express fears that a return to a hard border after Brexit, complete with customs and other checks, could be a target for militant groups.
Britain is due to leave the bloc in less than 10 weeks, with the future of the border at the center of its difficulties to strike an amicable divorce deal.
The British and Irish governments, which are co-guarantors of the 1998 peace deal, expressed concern at the incident.
""There is no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter.

The air strike targeted al Shabaab fighters who had rammed into the military base near Jilib, 370 km (230 miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu using a suicide car bomb, military officials in the state of Jubbaland told Reuters.
Pictures taken at the scene after the strike and seen by Reuters showed a large burnt-out flatbed truck surrounded by charred bodies. 
Other pictures appeared to show a car rigged with explosives that had not detonated at the Bar Sanguni forward operating base, which had come under al Shabaab attack.
Al Shabaab lost control of most Somali cities and towns after African Union and Somali troops pushed the hardline Islamists out of Mogadishu in 2011.
But their insurgency is still active.
On Friday they ambushed an Ethiopian military convoy 80 km (50 miles) north of Baidoa in central Somalia. Al Shabaab said it killed ""more than 57 Ethiopian invaders"". 
Ethiopia's Ministry of Defence said it used helicopter gunships and ""successfully repulsed the attack"" on the convoy which was able to continue on to its destination, Baidoa.
On Tuesday, al Shabaab militants attacked a hotel compound in neighboring Kenya, killing at least 21 people. 
The U.S. military said no civilians were believed to have been killed or injured in Saturday's strike.
Al Shabaab retains a strong presence in parts of southern and central Somalia, and the U.S. military has stepped up air strikes over the last year.

""The only demand we have is that this evil (regime) goes away,"" said Branisalv Trifunovic, an actor who addressed the crowd as he had done in previous weeks. ""We want elections, but freedom must come first.""
No-one at Vucic's office could be reached for comment. The President previously said he would not bow to opposition demands for electoral reform and increased media freedom ""even if there were 5 million people in the street"", but said he was willing to test his party's popularity in a snap vote. 
The latest protest follows a visit to Belgrade on Thursday by Russian President Vladimir, welcomed by tens of thousands of people bussed in from all over Serbia. 
""I came here to express my dissatisfaction with the ruling elite,"" said Ljiljana Zivanovic, a 64-year old pensioner. ""They (SNS and Vucic) control all media, I am sick of all the corruption going on."" 
The protests have spread to other cities in Serbia and on Friday were held in Novi Sad, the second-largest city, the southern city of Nis and several other towns, though numbers outside the capital remain small. 
""I came here to protest because there is no state any more. All power is concentrated in hands of one man,"" said Luka Tripkovic, who is studying for a doctorate at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade.

Cuba's foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks.
The protocols provide minimum security guarantees for guerrilla leaders to return to mountainous or jungle areas of Colombia with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, providing security from military attack for an agreed period.
Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Saturday that its extradition request did not come within the context of the abortive peace talks in Havana, but rather in response to a ""criminal act that violates human rights.""
""No act of this nature merits any kind of protocol that would avoid justice being done, for that reason we call upon this government to hand over these criminals in order for justice to be done,"" the right-wing leader in a televised address. 
Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing. 
The ELN, which was formed by radical Catholic priests in 1964, has not claimed responsibility or issued a public statement on Thursday's car bombing that was the worst in Colombia in almost 16 years. 
It did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
In the attack, a car broke through checkpoints onto the grounds of the General Santander (MC:SAN) School in the Colombian capital Bogota before detonating, killing at least 20 police cadets as well as the driver, whom the government has identified as ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas. 
In November, Colombia had asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other ELN commanders in Cuban territory. 
It had also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice on Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request, nor to multiple Reuters requests for comment.
Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under former President Juan Manuel Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.

Cuba had previously hosted talks between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which resulted in a peace agreement in 2016.

About 10 armed attackers from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) ambushed a border guard post near Wet Kyein village in Maungdaw township in the north of the state on Wednesday, according to the government-controlled Myanmar TV network.
A government spokesman could not be reached for comment.
Rakhine has been roiled by violence for weeks, since fighting broke out between security forces and another armed group, the Arakan Army (AA).
The AA, which pre-dates ARSA, is a rebel group dominated by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists that has been fighting for autonomy for the western state for around a decade.
ARSA, which emerged with attacks on border posts in 2016, is focused on winning rights for Rohingya, the mostly stateless Muslim minority long persecuted in Myanmar.
Some 5,000 civilians have been forced to flee their homes in the recent violence, according to the United Nations.
A crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine in 2017 triggered an exodus of about 730,000 Rohingya refugees to neighboring Bangladesh.
The United Nations and Western governments denounced the military operations as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has said it was conducting a legitimate offensive against insurgents.
Earlier reports had attributed an attack on Wednesday in the same area to the AA, but an official with the Maungdaw border guard police said ARSA, which had previously attacked the security forces, was responsible.
""At first, it was a preliminary investigation, but now it is sure,"" Police Lieutenant-Colonel Tin Han Lin told Reuters.
On Friday, Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, voiced alarm at the ""escalating violence"" in Rakhine, and urged both sides to show restraint and protect civilians.

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Saturday to receive the remains of four Americans killed in a suicide bombing in northern Syria.
Trump, locked in a battle with congressional Democrats that has led to a nearly month-long partial government shutdown, announced his trip via a pre-dawn tweet, saying he was going ""to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!""
Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House prior to departure that he planned to meet the families, a duty which he said ""might be the toughest thing I have to do as president.""
He was greeted by military staff at Dover Air Force Base after a short flight from Joint Base Andrews, but did not speak to reporters before entering his motorcade.
Flanked by military officials, Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan filed up a ramp leading onto a military transport aircraft, where a prayer was given to honor the memory of Scott Wirtz, a civilian Department of Defense employee from St. Louis. 
Trump filed down the plank and saluted while six service members clad in fatigues and white gloves carried an American flag-draped casket carrying Wirtz to a waiting gray van. 
The Dover base is a traditional hub for returning the remains of American troops abroad.
The United States believes the attack that killed the Americans was the work of Islamic State militants.
Trump announced last month that he planned to speedily withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, but has since said it does not need to go quickly as he tries to ensure safety of Kurdish allies in northern Syria who are at risk of attack from neighboring Turkey. 
Trump told reporters on Saturday that his Syria policy has made progress but that some work remained in destroying Islamic State targets. He defended his plans for a withdrawal.
""It's moving along very well, but when I took over it was a total mess. But you do have to ask yourself, we’re killing ISIS for Russia, for Iran, for Syria, for Iraq, for a lot of other places. At some point you want to bring our people back home,"" he said.
In addition to Wirtz, those who died during the Wednesday attack in Manbij, Syria, were Army Chief Warrant Officer Jonathan Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Florida, and Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon Kent, 35, identified as being from upstate New York, the Department of Defense said in a statement.
The Pentagon did not identify the fourth person killed, a contractor working for a private company. U.S. media identified her as Ghadir Taher, a 27-year-old employee of defense contractor Valiant Integrated Services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he had ""an incredible"" meeting with North Korea's nuclear envoy Kim Yong Chol and the two sides had made ""a lot of progress"" on denuclearization.
The White House announced after talks between Trump and Kim on Friday that the U.S. president would hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in late February, but would maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
""That was an incredible meeting,"" Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said of the talks.
""We've agreed to meet sometime, probably the end of February. We've picked a country but we'll be announcing it in the future. Kim Jong Un is looking very forward to it and so am I,"" Trump said.
""We have made a lot of progress as far as denuclearization is concerned and we are talking about a lot of different things. Things are going very well with North Korea.""
Trump and the White House have given no details of the talks, and despite his upbeat comments there has been no indication of any narrowing of differences over U.S. demands that North Korea abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States and Pyongyang's demands for a lifting of punishing sanctions.
A first summit in June in Singapore - the first-ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader - produced a vague commitment by Kim Jong Un to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but he has yet to take what Washington sees as concrete steps in that direction.
Critics of U.S. efforts say the first summit only boosted Kim's international stature without much to show for it, and some believe Trump may see a second meeting as a way of distracting from his domestic troubles.
Trump did not elaborate on the country chosen to host the summit, but Vietnam has been considered a leading candidate.
Kim Yong Chol, regarded as a member of Kim Jong Un's inner circle, also had talks on Friday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the U.S. special representative on North Korea, Stephen Biegun.
The State Department said the two sides had ""a productive first meeting at the working level"" and Biegun would travel to Sweden at the weekend to attend an international conference.
The conference is also being attended by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. Washington has been keen to set up talks between Biegun and Choe but North Korea has resisted, apparently wanting to keep exchanges high-level.

Asked if the two would meet in Stockholm, a State Department spokeswoman said: ""We have no meetings to announce.""

Rumyana Arnaudova, the chief prosecutor's spokeswoman, said on Saturday one of the six accused, who were all residents of Bulgaria, had been indicted in absentia and an international arrest warrant issued for him.
The crime group had been operating in Bulgaria since 2016 and had indirectly financed a terrorist organization operating in another state, Arnaudova said without giving more detail.
She said the financing had been carried out across the border through a traditional Muslim ""hawala"", an informal trading system based on trust and personal ties.
The group had also bought at least 100 cars in Bulgaria and transported them through Turkey to Syria, where they were provided to members of terrorist organizations, Arnaudova said.
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev said on Friday that the financing for the terrorist organizations had been sent abroad and did not represent a direct terrorist threat within Bulgaria.

Marching through central Budapest behind a banner saying ""We have had enough"", protesters waved Hungary's national tricolor and the European Union flag on their way to the main gathering point of the protest at the feet of the medieval Buda Castle.
""They totally ignore what we say and what we want, which is irritating,"" said Lajos Kovacs, one of the protesters.
Orban's ruling Fidesz party pushed the law allowing employers to ask workers to do up to 400 hours of overtime a year through the legislature last month, using its big majority as opposition parties sought to block the vote.
Orban has said the law served the interests of workers, who will have the legal possibility to work overtime at a time when the economy is struggling with a massive labor shortage.
A survey by pollster Zavecz Research published earlier this week showed support for Fidesz dropped by three points to 32 percent of voters in January, but even so, Orban's ruling party remained well ahead of its main rivals.

Nationalist Jobbik scored 11 percent, while the Socialists had 7 percent support according to the survey, which showed that a third of those polled had no preferred party.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Women will march in hundreds of U.S. cities and overseas on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of demonstrations that drew millions of protesters to the streets the day after Republican President Donald Trump's inauguration in January 2017.
Women's March, a national nonprofit organization that evolved from the initial Washington march, is again hosting its main event in Washington, with hundreds of ""sister"" marches in other cities.
March On, a separate grassroots coalition that also grew from the original march, has coordinated hundreds of marches in cities such as Boston, Houston, Baltimore and Denver.
Leaders of both groups say they will use this year's marches to push policy related to raising the minimum wage, access to reproductive and healthcare and voting rights, among other issues. They are aiming to mobilize women to vote ahead of the 2020 elections, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.
""There is definitely huge, huge focus on the 2020 elections,"" said March On's Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women's March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which is leading Saturday's march there.
Activists say the marches are a chance to celebrate the gains made in the 2018 elections, which saw more women elected to the U.S. Congress than ever before.
The newly elected women - nearly all Democrats - include the first Muslim women and first Native American women in Congress, as well as the first black women to represent their states in New England. Many cited Trump's presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office.
As the political movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017 has grown, divisions have emerged.
In some cities, like New York and Washington, there will be more than one march or demonstration due to criticism that some Women's March leaders are anti-Semitic - a charge those leaders have sought to dispel in recent interviews and statements. 
The marches also have been criticized as being not welcoming to conservative women, who may support Trump's presidency and oppose abortion rights. The ""March for Life"" by anti-abortion campaigners was in Washington on Friday, attended by Vice President Mike Pence.
Leaders of Women's March and March On say there is a role for everyone.

""We are all part of the same movement, regardless of any divisiveness or any drama that goes on,"" Sanchez said.

The rejection this week of London's deal with the European Union by British lawmakers has thrown the process into disarray with options ranging from a no-deal Brexit in 10 weeks time to staying in the bloc. 
""I will work until the very last day to get a solution with a deal for Britain's exit from the EU and I will work towards having the best relationship,"" Merkel said at a conservative party event in the northern city of Rostock.
Merkel said Germany respected Britain's decision to leave, but added: ""We have a responsibility to shape a divorce process so that people don't shake their heads at us in 50 years time and say why weren't they in a position to make a compromise?""

In a bid to counter growing eurosceptic nationalism before elections to the European Parliament in May, Merkel has stressed the importance of close cooperation within the bloc. 
On Jan. 22 she signs an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron that builds on a 1963 treaty of post-war reconciliation and is aimed at bolstering the EU.
In a speech to her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) in the northern city of Rostock, Merkel said: ""It is good that after several decades we want to develop a common defense policy ... We must develop weapons systems together,"" adding Europe had many more systems than the United States.
Arguing that EU countries should not compete among themselves for new projects and fighter planes but develop products together, she said there would be a need to compromise on export rules.
""We have very strict export rules, others have less strict rules ... But anyone who develops an airplane with us would also like to know whether they can sell the plane with us,"" she said. 
""We will have to make compromises, that is what we are talking about at the moment.""
Last year, France stopped short of Germany's move to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
In her weekly podcast, Merkel stressed the importance of the French-German partnership at the heart of the EU, saying the friendship was ""far from a given after centuries of military conflict between our countries"".
""We want to give an impulse to European unity,"" Merkel said. 

Although the two countries, traditionally the EU's main engine, differ on issues such as euro zone reform, the treaty envisages deeper cooperation in foreign and defense policy and in tackling terrorism as well as more cultural exchanges. [nL8N1Z941C]

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 10:07AM ET</span>","Lack of school nurses puts Los Angeles students at risk, striking teachers say","By Alex Dobuzinskis and Sharon Bernstein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles teacher Natali Escobedo says she will never forget the image of a diabetic fourth-grader “wilting” at her school because there was no nurse on hand to administer his insulin.
The episode, which followed years of tight budgets that left little money for medical staff, highlights the potential impact of a lack of nurses throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the key reasons Escobedo and her colleagues are on strike. 
In L.A., as in many districts across the United States, the school nurse is the first and sometimes only point of entry for many families into a complicated and expensive health-care system. 
Like most schools in the more than 1,200-campus district, Lockwood Elementary, where Escobedo teaches, has a nurse just once a week. Children who become ill are left to the care of first-aid trained administrators or simply wait for a nurse to come from a nearby school to help them.
""There were times when the student would be struggling because of his condition,"" Escobedo said. ""He would have to wait or the nurse would get sidetracked due to some other emergency and my student had to sit in the office like a wilting flower waiting for his medicine to arrive."" 
Teachers in the massive district, which serves more than 600,000 students, have been on strike since Jan. 14.
In an unusual twist for a labor negotiation, the two sides are fairly close on salary, but teachers say they are holding out for an improvement in student conditions, citing the need for more school nurses, psychologists and smaller class sizes in a district where as many as 46 students are sometimes crammed in a single classroom. 
The teachers are demanding a full-time nurse at every school in the district, compared with a current nursing staff of about 400. 
A previous offer from the school district came close to meeting the teachers' demand for a 6.5 percent salary increase, but would increase the number of nurses for just one year. The union, United Teachers Los Angeles, rejected the proposal.
Even if the district was willing to hire more medical staff, it may have difficulty finding suitable candidates because of a nationwide shortage of nurses, said Sosse Bedrossian, director of nursing services for L.A. Unified, which
currently employs 400 nurses and has openings to hire 30 more. 
""I would always advocate for more nurses,"" said Bedrossian, herself a school nurse. ""But even if we did have a full-time nurse at every school, would we be able to fill those positions?""
In a typical day, a school nurse might work with diabetic students administering insulin, assess school athletes to make sure they are healthy enough to play safely and handle a succession of cuts, bruises, fevers and upset stomachs, Bedrossian said.
If there is no nurse, she said, school administrators trained in first aid will take a child's temperature, call parents and in emergencies, call paramedics to assist. Nurses in nearby schools will also come to help if needed.
The school district also has about 30 clinics and wellness centers at various campuses, an acknowledgement of the key role that school nurses play for families in disadvantaged areas.
But nurse Stephanie Yellin-Mednick, who works at four different schools as well as a nursing field office, said that is not enough. An on-site nurse can not only help a child in an emergency, she said, but might also notice medical or psychological issues that administrators who are not health care professionals would miss.
Once, she said, she decided to take the blood pressure of a child who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt on a hot day. Pushing up the child's sleeve, she saw evidence of the self-harming behavior known as cutting, a sign that the student was having serious mental health problems.
At Gaspar De Portola Middle School in the San Fernando Valley, administrators were so worried about not having a nurse on campus every day that they decided to devote federal funds that would otherwise go to pay for textbooks and other needs to paying for a full-time nurse, said Susan Calkins, a teacher who is the school's union representative.
The need is particularly acute at schools in poor areas, where families have little access to medical care, and parents cannot leave work to simply pick up sick children and take them home, said Escobedo, the fourth-grade teacher.

""When you are working at a school with children who do not have the basic necessities of life, then a school nurse is absolutely vital,"" she said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Five thousand ""Yellow Vest"" demonstrators marched through the French capital on Saturday, marking a tenth consecutive weekend of protests against President Emmanuel Macron's government.
Protesters assembled by the Invalides esplanade near the Assemblee Nationale parliament and marched through the city's Left Bank. The demonstrations were peaceful, although many shops had nevertheless shut in case of trouble.
A police source said there were around 5,000 protesters in Paris, some of whom gathered near the Champs Elysees, while there were similar demonstrations in major cities across France.
""Macron, resign!"" some of the protesters shouted.
Some had also made coffin-type objects to denote the deaths of 10 people so far during the protests, mainly due to accidents when demonstrators blocked roads.
The ""yellow vest"" protests - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists must have in their cars - began in November over higher fuel taxes. 
Those fuel taxes were subsequently scrapped, yet the movement has morphed into a broader anti-Macron protest.
December's demonstrations wreaked some of the worst violence seen in decades in Paris, as rioters burned cars and damaged shops and businesses.
Protests so far this month have not witnessed the same level of trouble, although video of a former French boxing champion punching and kicking police in Paris shocked many.

Macron has launched a series of national debates to help quell public discontent and restore his standing.

Speaking in Ankara, Graham also said he believed U.S. Chief of Staff Joseph Dunford was working on a plan with Turkey to move Kurdish YPG elements away from the Turkish border.
Trump announced last month that Islamic State had been defeated in Syria and he would pull U.S. forces out of the country.
The decision injected new uncertainty into the eight-year-long Syrian war and spurred a flurry of contacts over how a resulting security vacuum will be filled across northern and eastern Syria where the U.S. forces are stationed.
The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011, nine years after the 2003 U.S-led invasion, left space for the rise of Islamic State militants, prompting the United States to intervene again.
A bomb attack this week claimed by the militant group killed two U.S. troops and two civilians working for the U.S. military in northern Syria, along with other civilians.
The attack in Manbij appeared to be the deadliest on U.S. forces in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015. The town is controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
It remains unclear when U.S. forces will leave northern Syria, where both Turkey and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad are ready to fill the vacuum. The YPG militia allied to the fighters holding Manbij last month invited Assad into the area around the town to forestall a potential Turkish assault.
Erdogan said last week he had discussed a safe zone with Trump, which Turkey would set up inside Syria along their border.
""Here's the good news: General Dunford, I think, has a plan that he's working on with the Turkish military that can accomplish these objectives and they are to move the YPG elements away from Turkey,"" said Graham, adding heavy armaments should be taken from the Kurdish groups.
Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Graham also said the political arm of the YPG was interlinked and interconnected with the PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.
""A withdrawal that does not outline the points I have made will not end the war against ISIS (Islamic State), it will start a new war,"" he said.
""This war will be a necessity by Turkey, to go into Syria and clear out armed elements that Turkey believes poses a threat to its sovereignty.""
A Turkish official told Reuters that the United States should consider Turkey's priorities, not those of the YPG.

""After (Graham's) meetings in Turkey, (with) Erdogan and other officials, we hope the U.S. will understand more the situation,"" the official said.

The group, which calls itself the 'Iconoclastic Sect', made the claim on a Spanish web page, and said December's attack outside the Saint Dionysios church in the heavily policed, upmarket Kolonaki neighborhood, was just the start.
""Our hands will not tremble when the time comes to spill blood, we won't show mercy or sensitivity towards our enemies,"" the group said on the website.

""I think now that we have an opportunity, because nearly in Syria we have a ceasefire now, in the northeast of Syria and the north of Syria, and the efforts of fighting terrorism has achieved good results,"" Nasr Hariri told Reuters in an interview in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh, where he is based.
Hariri, the opposition's chief negotiator in U.N. peace talks, met with the newly appointed United Nations Special Envoy to Syria Geir Pedersen on Friday.
""Now it is time to invest all of these developments: the ceasefire, fighting terrorism, the belief of the majority of the Syrian people that the only solution to the Syrian crisis is the political solution,"" Hariri added.
In December, Russia, Iran and Turkey - supporters of the main sides in Syria's complex civil war - failed to agree on the makeup of a U.N.-sponsored Syrian Constitutional Committee but called for it to convene early next year to kick off a viable peace process.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have reclaimed most of Syria with Russian and Iranian support apart from the northern province of Idlib, has clung to power throughout the conflict and is widely seen as being loath to yield power after it ends.
Arab states, including some that once backed rebels against Assad, are seeking to reconcile with him after decisive gains by his forces in the war, aiming to expand their influence in Syria at the expense of non-Arab Turkey and Iran.
""All the countries... Turkey, to some extent Russia and the Arab countries believe ... that without a political solution, the normalization with the (Assad) regime would be impossible,"" Hariri said.

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 08:33AM ET</span>",Leader of Bavarian CSU promises new start with Merkel's party,"MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - The new leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) on Saturday promised an era of improved cooperation with Angela Merkel's conservative party, with whom they share power at a federal level, in a bid to win back disillusioned voters.
With European elections in May and four German state votes this year, both the CSU and Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) want to draw a line under their bickering, especially on migrant policy, which nearly brought down the coalition last year. 
As expected, CSU delegates elected Markus Soeder to replace Horst Seehofer as their leader with an 87.4 percent majority at a party conference. He was the sole candidate. 
""The conservatives should work with each other again instead of against each other, we should emphasize what we agree on rather than what we disagree on,"" Soeder, 52, told his party.
""It is time for a new show of strength from the CDU and CSU in Germany,"" he said, to loud applause.
The two parties form a parliamentary bloc in the Bundestag lower house and share power in Chancellor Merkel's coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), but polls show they have lost support since the 2017 federal election.
Soeder took over from Seehofer - for years a thorn in Merkel's side - as premier of the powerful state of Bavaria last year but Seehofer remains federal interior minister.
Soeder has at times sought to woo right-wing voters from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) with tough rhetoric on migrant policy but he changed tack, attacking the AfD and striking a more centrist line, before a disastrous state vote in October.
Breaking the mould for a CSU leader in the mostly Catholic state, Soeder is a Protestant who drinks little alcohol. He is known for his extravagant costumes during the beer-fuelled carnival season which have included Shrek and Marilyn Monroe.
In the absence of the toxic relationship between Seehofer and Merkel - she relinquished her role as CDU party leader in December while remaining chancellor - the two parties could better cooperate, say commentators.

The CDU's new leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has tried to build bridges. Areas of agreement include reducing some taxes and trying to find ways to help Germany's car industry whose reputation has been hit by the diesel emissions cheating scandal.

MILAN (Reuters) - At least three people died at sea on Friday after a rubber dinghy carrying around 20 migrants ran into trouble in the Mediterranean some 100 km north of Tripoli, an Italian navy official said.
Three people had been saved while the others were missing, the Italian navy said.
Rear Admiral Fabio Agostini told state TV channel RaiNews24 a military plane on sea patrol had first sighted the dinghy sinking in rough waters and had thrown two safety rafts into the water before leaving due to a lack of fuel.
A helicopter dispatched from a naval ship had then rescued three people, who were suffering from severe hypothermia and were taken to hospital on the island of Lampedusa.
""During this operation at least three bodies were seen in the water who appeared to be dead,"" Agostini said.
The Italian navy said in a statement rescue operations, coordinated by the Libyan Rescue Coordination Center, had concluded after the search for the dinghy proved fruitless.
""As long as European ports will remain open ... sea-traffickers will continue to do business and kill people,"" Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post late on Friday.
Since Italy's populist government came to power in June, Salvini, leader of the anti-migrant League, has closed Italian ports to humanitarian vessels.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 4,449 people arrived in Europe in the first 16 days of the year, almost all by sea, compared with 2,964 in the same period of 2018.
IOM data showed 2,297 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean last year.
Italian news agency AGI reported on Saturday 13 migrants had arrived on Saturday in Lampedusa following 68 arrivals the previous day, the year's first two groups of arrivals.

KOLKATA, India (Reuters) - India's main opposition parties joined forces against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday at a rally which attracted hundreds of thousands of people months ahead of elections.
The 23 regional groups said they forged a common front to stop Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which beat the main opposition Congress and regional parties in 2014.
Rural anger over weak farm prices and sluggish job creation mean Modi's BJP faces a tough challenge to stay in power after electoral losses in three key states last month.
Hundreds of thousands of people flocked to Kolkata from rural Bengal for the rally, bringing disruption to the city.
Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of the state of West Bengal, called on regional party leaders to join a single platform to defeat the ""anti-people"" government of Modi, which the 64-year-old said was ""nearing its end"".
A poll last month by ABP News forecast Modi's party could fall about 25 seats short of a majority in national elections and Banerjee is among the few opposition leaders who could emerge as a prime ministerial candidate if the BJP loses.
Regional parties hold the key as they dominate the eastern states of West Bengal, Odisha, and the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which together send 161 members to the 543 constituencies of parliament's lower house.
Missing from Saturday's lineup was Rahul Gandhi, president of the main opposition Congress party and leaders of the left parties, reflecting tensions among opposition parties on who would be their prime ministerial candidate against Modi. 
Gandhi sent his representatives and a letter of support.
FOCUS ON JOBS 
After the formation of a strong alliance between Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) last week in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 members to the lower house, Modi's party faces a risk of losing elections, Banerjee said. 
Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of Delhi, said Modi had failed to fulfill his promises including job creation.
""Modi had promised to create 20 million jobs a year but after a faulty launch of national sales tax and demonetization in 2016 more than 10 million jobs were lost,"" he said.
India's unemployment rate hit 7.4 percent in December, highest in 15 months, while the number of people employed fell by nearly 11 million from a year ago, a report by the Mumbai-based Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, said this month. 
Politicians at the rally, whose organizers said was attended by more than a million people, said India's growth had slowed during Modi's term and their first priority was to defeat him, adding a replacement would be decided after the elections.
The BJP dismissed the prospects of an opposition alliance, questioning who would lead such a coalition.
Modi is expected to detail a package worth more than 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion) in his last budget on Feb 1, including benefits for farmers and other taxpayers. 
($1 = 71.2000 Indian rupees)

GDANSK, Poland (Reuters) - Murdered Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz's funeral drew tens of thousands of people in the Polish Baltic coast city on Saturday amid outrage over his murder six days ago.
Banners with black and white pictures of Adamowicz were draped over buildings as Polish politicians including former president Lech Walesa, who helped to overturn communism in Eastern Europe, joined a mass at St Mary's Basilica.
Council of Europe head Donald Tusk and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also joined mourners who listened to the choir as they awaited the burial of Adamowicz's ashes.
Adamowicz, one of Poland's longest-serving mayors, was attacked on stage during one of Poland's biggest annual charity events and died the following day.
Broadcaster TVN24 said 3,500 mourners gathered inside the 500-year-old Gothic cathedral on Saturday, while others watched Gdansk archbishop Leszek Slawoj Glodz give family members rosaries and gifts sent by Pope Francis on huge screens.
""What happened on Sunday evening ... was perceived as a violent constant sound of a alarming bell, call for saving the conscience and changing the way of our living, political style,"" Glodz told mourners during the Mass.
The murder of a liberal critic of Poland's ruling party's anti-immigrant policies highlights the charged atmosphere in parts of eastern Europe where populist leaders have fanned nationalist sentiment.
As well as encouraging migrants to seek refuge in Gdansk, Adamowicz was known for backing a campaign to defend the rule of law against what activists consider efforts by the ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party to increase political control over the judiciary and other bodies. 
SOLIDARITY
On Friday, 53,000 people paid tribute to Adamowicz, who beat the PiS in October, while he lay in state in the museum of the Solidarity movement that helped to usurp communism in Poland.
Police said some 45,000 people had attended the funeral.
Polish authorities have arrested a 27-year-old former convict, named only as Stefan W., over the killing. He was freed last month after serving 5-1/2 years for attempted bank robbery. 
The attacker accused the mayor's former party of putting him in prison, where he said he was tortured, at the event.
Authorities have detained at least 10 people in recent days over calls on social media to murder and other acts of aggression in the wake of Adamowicz's death. 
Adamowicz was one of 11 Polish mayors targeted with fake death certificates by a far-right group called All-Polish Youth in 2017, after signing a declaration to welcome refugees in opposition to government policy.

Critics blame Poland's politicians for cranking up hate speech and support for the PiS party fell to 30 percent in the wake of Adamowicz's death, a poll conducted by Kantar Millward Brown showed, from 33 percent in November. The biggest opposition grouping Koalicja Obywatelska had 25 percent.

MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - A major winter storm was expected to clobber a large swath of the northern United States with heavy snow, gusty winds and frigid temperatures making travel difficult and dangerous starting on Friday and through the weekend, forecasters said. 
The storm system will dump 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) of snow in the Plains and Midwest on Friday night and Saturday and as it moves east at least a foot of snow in parts of the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said in several advisories. 
The system was expected to also bring freezing rain, wind gusts of 35 miles (56 km) per hour and quickly dropping temperatures that will to dip into the teens and even below zero Fahrenheit in several areas, the service said.
""If you don't have to go outside, it probably is best that you don't,"" said Amy Seeley, an NWS meteorologist in Chicago. ""People will have to worry about blowing and drifting snow.""
Forecasters and officials in several states warned that snow accumulation and drifts on highways and roadways will make driving difficult and dangerous. 
More than 900 domestic flights had been canceled and another 3,100 delayed as of 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) on Friday, according to Flightaware.com, an online tracking service. 
Several airlines said on Twitter they will issue waivers and told travelers to expect more delays and cancellations during the weekend.
Amtrak canceled train service from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and New York on Saturday and canceled and modified several routes that originate and end on the east coast on Sunday. 

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf declared a state of emergency for his state where he said two inches of snow per hour was expected. Speed limits on many Pennsylvania highways will be restricted to 45 mph, he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Rival groups held demonstrations in Thailand's capital on Saturday, with hundreds of people demanding quick elections to end military rule and a much smaller group of pro-junta supporters saying it was too soon for a vote.
The competing protests were tiny compared to those that paralyzed Bangkok in 2014 before the army seized power in the name of ending instability, but were an indication of the tensions in the run-up to a long-delayed ballot.
No date has been set for an election which was first promised for 2015 and most recently postponed from Feb. 24.
Hundreds joined a demonstration calling for elections on March 10.
""We're calling for elections as soon as possible,"" activist Sirawith Seritiwa told the crowd. 
The junta has said the most recent election delay is because of scheduling difficulties with planning for the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in early May - although it has said it still wants the ballot held before those ceremonies.
The Election Commission of Thailand has given March 10 or March 24 as possible polling dates, but no date has been set and a royal decree must be issued before it can be. 
Some 1 km (0.6 miles) from the demonstration calling for elections, around 30 counter-protesters gathered with placards at the Democracy Monument. They said they were not opposed to a ballot, but national unity must come first.
""We can wait for elections,"" the group's leader, Jathurun Bunbenjara, told reporters. ""We don't agree with protests that create chaos... We want to see Thais come together and hold an auspicious and great coronation.""
Thailand's longstanding political divide is between strongly royalist and pro-military conservatives and ""red shirt"" populists linked to exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra who have won every election since 2001.
Despite measures by the junta to entrench the ruling generals' hold on power after any election, opinion polls have shown that Thaksin's supporters remain politically strong.
Activist Sirawith denied that the group intended to create chaos ahead of the coronation - saying that holding elections earlier would reduce that danger.
It will be the first Thai coronation in living memory. The king's revered late father ruled for more than 70 years until his death in 2016.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Former Afghan warlord Hekmatyar enters presidential race,"KABUL (Reuters) - A former warlord accused of historic war crimes entered Afghanistan's presidential race on Saturday in a new challenge to President Ashraf Ghani who allowed him to return from exile two decades he was forced out by the Taliban.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose fighters killed thousands in Kabul during the bloody civil war of the 1990s, has remained a divisive figure since his return from exile in 2016. 
His decision to contest the presidential polls in July is seen by analysts as the ex-warlord's attempt legitimize his Hizb-i-Islami party. The faction has been blamed for atrocities committed during Afghanistan's brutal civil war, which led many Afghans to welcome the emergence of the Taliban in 1996 in the hope the hardline Islamist group would restore law and order.
In 2003, the U.S. State Department listed him as a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al Qaeda and the Taliban. But Washington later welcomed Ghani's decision to sign a peace deal with Hekmatyar.
In 2016, President Ghani's government granted immunity to Hekmatyar but the former warlord has been critical of his administration and the parliamentary election process in 2018.
Announcing his candidacy, Hekmatyar pledged to restore peace and security and said the current government had failed to end the war with the Taliban.
""Our country's situation requires a powerful central government lead by an elected president supported by the majority of people,"" he told a news conference in Kabul.
The July election faces serious security challenges with the Taliban threatening large parts of the country. The polls will be a crucial test for election officials who were criticized for failing to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections last October. The 2014 presidential election won by Ghani was also tainted by accusations of widespread cheating. 
Afghanistan's presidential race is now in full swing, with several former officials, politicians lining up to challenge Ghani who is expected to register his candidacy for a second term on Sunday.
On Saturday Interior Minister Amrullah Saleh resigned to run for the vice-presidency as part of Ghani's team, according to two political sources.
In December, Ghani appointed Saleh, a former security official and an uncompromising opponent of the Taliban, to his government in a bid to secure the support of former opponents for a second term.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s powerful UGTT union called on Saturday for another national strike for two days next month to press its demand for higher wages for 670,000 public servants, the UGTT chief said.
Rail, bus and air traffic and all services stopped in Tunisia and street protests drew thousands on Thursday in a one-day nationwide strike to challenge the government’s refusal to raise salaries.
""As negotiations with the government failed and the purchasing power has deteriorated significantly, UGTT decided to approve a nationwide strike on Feb. 20 and 21,"" UGTT chief Nourredine Taboubi told reporters.
The decision will raise the pressure on the government which is struggling to revive the faltering economy.
The government is also under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to freeze public sector wages, the bill for which doubled to about 16 billion dinars ($5.5 billion) in 2018 from 7.6 billion in 2010, as part of measures to reduce its budget deficit.
But the UGTT says the monthly average wage of about $250 is one of the lowest in the world, while the state Institute of Strategic Studies says real purchasing power has fallen by 40 percent since 2014.
The government had said it does not have the money to pay for the increases strikers want, worth about $850 million in total.
Government spokesman Iyad Dahmani said that increase would lift annual inflation to 10 percent from 7.4 percent.
An economic crisis has eroded living standards for Tunisians and unemployment is high as political turmoil and lack of reforms have deterred investment needed to create jobs. That has forced the government to launch austerity measures to please donors and lenders including the IMF.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban rejected reports in the Pakistani media that they were prepared to resume meetings with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad and repeated their refusal to deal directly with the Afghan government.
Pakistani newspapers and television stations reported that a meeting in Islamabad was in prospect following discussions between Khalilzad and Pakistani officials including Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday. 
Senior Taliban leaders said that regional powers including Pakistan had approached them and wanted them to meet the U.S. delegation in Islamabad and also include the Afghan government in the peace process but that the approaches had been rejected.
""We wanted to make it clear that we will not hold any meeting with Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement.
Talks between the two sides have stalled after the Taliban accused Khalilzad of straying from the agreed agenda and there is no clarity on when they may resume.
""We have made it clear again and again that we would never hold any meeting with the Afghan government as we know that they are not capable of addressing our demands,"" said one senior Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The United States says any settlement in Afghanistan must be between the internationally recognized Afghan government and the Taliban, who have so far refused to talk to an administration they describe as an illegitimate puppet regime.
The Taliban leader said peace talks with the U.S. delegation could resume if they were assured that only three issues would be discussed - a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, an exchange of prisoners and lifting a ban on the movement of Taliban leaders.
Khalilzad arrived in Islamabad on Thursday and met Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other officials. 
""The two sides reviewed developments post Abu Dhabi, in order to take the Afghan peace process forward,"" a foreign office statement said. An Afghan Taliban delegation had a round of talks last month with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi. 
The statement didn't give any further details on the talks, but several local TV channels reported that Pakistan agreed to host the next round of talks between the Afghan Taliban and the United States in Islamabad. 
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush's ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by the Trump administration four months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace.
Washington has long been pushing Islamabad to lean on Taliban leaders, who it says are based in Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table.
It often accuses the south Asian nation of covertly sheltering Taliban leaders, an accusation Islamabad vehemently denies.

The United States, which had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at its peak during the first term of former President Barack Obama, withdrew most of them in 2014 but still keeps around 14,000 there.

The mission to save the child has triggered an outpouring of public support as rescuers struggle with the challenge of reaching the toddler safely and bringing heavy equipment up steep access roads.
""It's absolutely amazing the energy that we see here and the desire to get that boy out of there,"" Angel Vidal, one of the engineers involved in the rescue, said on Friday evening.
The boy, Julen, fell into the borehole, which is just 25 cm (10 inches) wide and 100 meters (yards) deep, as his family walked through a private estate in Totalan, Malaga.
Officials have been unable to find signs of life but say they are working on the basis that the child is still alive.
Trucks brought drilling equipment and giant pipes to the site on Friday. Drilling of the first of two tunnels that will be made to reach the boy is expected to begin at midday local time on Saturday and take around 15 hours, officials said.
Residents of the town have held vigils for Julen and in support of his family. Spanish media say the boy's parents suffered another tragedy in 2017 when their three-year-old son died suddenly of health problems while walking along a beach.
""Be strong, Julen. Totalan is with you,"" read a handmade banner hung on the roadside near the rescue site.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It may not put a meal on the table for furloughed federal employees, but some U.S. museums and symphonies are supplying food for the mind in free admission for workers affected by the longest partial federal government shutdown in U.S. history.
With the shutdown in its fourth week with no end in sight, cultural institutions from Massachusetts to Oregon are moving to help unpaid federal workers spend some of their otherwise idle hours with loved ones enjoying art, science history or music.
Museums in at least 27 states, along with at least 19 orchestras, offered free admission to federal workers who have unpaid time on their hands. Institutions range from The Metropolitan Opera in New York to the San Diego Air & Space Museum, home of the Apollo IX Command Module, which helped pave the way for man to walk on the Moon.
Nearly 200 furloughed employees have taken advantage of an offer from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which waived its admission fee for each furloughed worker plus one guest, said museum spokesman Norman Keyes. Fine art highlights at the museum, whose front steps were made famous in the ""Rocky"" movie series, include Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" and an array of Rubens and Renoirs.
""Museums can offer a place both to get away from the fray and to recharge, and to gain perspective,"" Keyes said. ""It will not solve the shutdown crisis, but it can help build positive experiences during a difficult time.""
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry has also waived admission fees for each furloughed worker plus two guests for the duration of the shutdown. Star attractions include a German U-Boat submarine seized in 1944, the only one captured during World War II. It is the length of a city block, the museum boasts on its website.
Symphonies from Boston to Akron, Ohio, offered no-cost concert tickets to ease the stress of wondering when your next paycheck will be issued. 
""Great music has the power to inspire, reduce stress and ease burdens,"" said Joseph Giunta, who conducts the Des Moines Symphony. 
""We invite federal employees to join us as our guests for an upcoming Masterworks concert,"" said Giunta, noting each worker was offered two tickets which otherwise sell for $20 apiece or more.

Much of the federal workforce lives in or around Washington, D.C., but these people may be out of luck. That is because premiere cultural institutions such as the Smithsonian's museums, galleries and zoo, which are always free to the public, remain closed to all for the remainder of the shutdown.

Major said he compromised on key decisions on the Northern Irish peace process and the first Gulf War while prime minister between 1990 and 1997, and May should do the same after her Brexit plan was rejected by a huge majority in parliament.
""Her deal is dead and I don’t think honestly that tinkering with it is going to make very much difference if any difference at all,"" Major, who campaigned to stay in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum, told BBC Radio.
May is due to tell parliament on Monday how she intends to proceed on Brexit. Lawmakers may then propose alternatives to see if any could command majority support.
""If we leave in chaos and without a deal, that seems to me to be the worst of all outcomes,"" Major said.
May should therefore ""go around"" lawmakers in her party who say they are ready to accept a no-deal Brexit and drop her opposition to key issues in the negotiations, Major - who also faced a revolt inside the Conservative Party over Europe - said.
May has ruled out staying in the EU's single market, an option that is considered less economically damaging, because Britain would not be able to control immigration from the bloc. She has also rejected staying in a customs union with the EU.
If May cannot compromise, she should allow parliament to find a way to overcome its splits, Major said. ""I think there are signs parliament might be able to reach consensus,"" he said.
Failing that, Britain should have a fresh referendum on its membership of the EU.
In the meantime, delaying Brexit was wise, Major said. 
Major's comments were rejected as ""Remainer elite views"" by a Conservative lawmaker who said May would break her promises to voters if she considered staying in the EU's single market or a customs union or holding a second referendum.

""Brexit would become meaningless. We wouldn't be leaving the European Union, we would be staying in the European Union,"" Suella Braverman told the BBC.

Mexican television footage showed flames leaping into the night sky in the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City, as people screamed and cried for help.
Hidalgo's governor Omar Fayad told Mexican television that emergency services had registered the charred bodies of 21 people, and that at least 71 others had been injured.
Fayad said the number of victims could still rise depending on what emergency services discovered where the blaze had been hottest, which had been difficult to access.
Shortly before midnight, Public Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the fire had been put out, and that the government would need time to establish the final death toll.
Images published on broadcaster Televisa showed people with severe burns from the blast as the government sent in ambulances and doctors to treat the victims.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has launched a major crackdown on rampant fuel theft, which the government said cost the country more than $3 billion last year.
The explosion was one of the worst in recent history in a country that has suffered hundreds of illegal ruptures to its network of oil and gas pipelines.
""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,"" Fayad said on Twitter. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk.""
The ruptured pipeline was near the Tula refinery of state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in a statement blamed the incident on an illegal tap.
Separate television footage showed the pipeline gushing a fountain of fuel earlier in the day and dozens of people at the site trying to fill buckets and plastic containers.
Lopez Obrador expressed his concern on Twitter, and said he wanted ""the entire government"" to help people at the scene.
Separately, Pemex said on Friday evening it was also dealing with a separate pipeline rupture by suspected fuel thieves in San Juan del Rio in the neighboring state of Queretaro. There was no danger to the population, the firm added.
The president's crackdown on theft has significant public backing, though his decision to turn off pipelines to thwart the thieves disrupted fuel supply in central Mexico and raised concern that the shortages could damage the economy.

Some users of social media responded to the explosion with anger, saying the fuel thieves only had themselves to blame.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's public workers have rejected a second offer to raise their salaries and demanded to be paid in dollars, days after at least three people died in violent anti-government protests.
Hundreds of Zimbabweans were detained on public order charges on Friday, as the United Nations urged an end to a security crackdown and an internet blackout. 
Zimbabweans, who have seen their purchasing power eroded by soaring inflation despite adopting the dollar in 2009, say President Emmerson Mnangagwa has not delivered on pre-election pledges to kick-start growth after the exit of Robert Mugabe.
Mnangagwa has promised a clean break from the 37-year era of Mugabe, who was forced out in a de facto coup in November 2017 but the economy is afflicted by a severe shortage of dollars which has led to shortages of fuel and medicines.
The government has offered to pay 305,000 civil servants, including the security forces, $300 million for the period between April and December, a monthly average rise of $109 each.
But workers rejected this latest offer, the second in two weeks at a meeting on Friday, Thomas Muzondo, deputy chairman of the Apex Council, a grouping of all civil service unions, said, adding that a third round of talks was scheduled for next week.
""We insisted on U.S. dollar salaries but the government totally rejected this, saying they do not manufacture dollars. We are now consulting our membership but we told the government that their offer is nowhere near our expectations,"" he said.
Civil servants, who gave Mnangagwa's government a 14-day notice to strike on January 8, want to be paid in dollars or have the monthly salary of the lowest paid worker increased from $414 to $1,700, Muzondo said.

Supplies of dollars have dried up and Zimbabweans have seen their deposits in the electronic banking system losing value, raising fears that the southern African nation might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2019 03:02AM ET</span>",Gunmen kill two Buddhist monks in Thailand's troubled south,"NARATHIWAT, Thailand (Reuters) - Unknown gunmen shot dead two Buddhist monks and injured two others in an attack at a temple in Thailand's mainly Muslim south, the first such killing of a Buddhist monk in the restive region in more than three years.
An abbot and vice abbot were killed when at least six assailants believed to be dressed as members of a government security force burst into the Rattanupap temple in Narathiwat province and opened fire late on Friday, police said.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha and religious leaders condemned the attack in the mainly ethnic Malay province, the scene of a long-running insurgency against Thai rule.
""The prime minister condemns this outrageous act and has ordered officials to quickly investigate the incident and apprehend these criminals,"" the prime minister's office said in a statement.
Thai Muslim leaders also spoke out against the shooting of monks.
""We urge perpetrators of violence in the southern border provinces from all sides to stop killing innocent people and religious leaders,"" the Sheikhul Islam Office, which represents Thailand's Muslim minority, said in a statement.
Police said the assailants were still at large.
A separatist insurgency has dragged on in southern Thailand for more than fifteen years. More than 6,900 people have been killed and 13,000 injured in the area since 2004 when violence intensified, independent monitoring group Deep South Watch says.
Thailand is a predominantly Buddhist country but Muslim Malays are a majority in three southern provinces bordering Malaysia.
The three provinces, and a small part of neighboring Songkhla, were part of a sultanate annexed by Thailand in 1909. Separatist tensions have simmered ever since.
As with most violence in Thailand's deep south, there was no claim of responsibility for Friday's attack. Buddhist and Muslim leaders as well as state officials have often been targeted by insurgents.
At least 23 monks have been killed and more than 20 wounded since 2004, but there has not been an attack on monks since 2015. An imam was shot on Jan. 11, also in Narathiwat province.
The killings have added a religious dimension to a conflict that initially was rooted in ethnic and national tensions.
""Many Buddhists, not just in the south but across the country, are feeling aggrieved by Muslims, and it will take time for that to change,"" Rakchart Suwan, chairman of the Buddhist Network for Peace, told Reuters.
Analysts said the latest incident showed that insurgent group Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) retained significant military capacity despite government efforts to wipe it out.
""Regardless of BRN's specific objectives with this attack, the Thai government would be very foolish not to consider the danger of a toxic communal atmosphere in the south which could get out of control,"" Anthony Davis, an analyst with defense and security publisher Jane's, told Reuters.
The Thai military government has taken part since 2015 in talks brokered by Malaysia that aim to end the violence but the BRN has stayed out of the dialogue.
That process was stalled last year and Bangkok has signaled that it will return to the talks this year.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) powered into the fourth round of the Australian Open on Saturday with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of Dayana Yastremska then consoled the Ukrainian teenager after leaving her in tears.
The 37-year-old Williams, chasing a record-extending eighth Melbourne title in the professional era, barely broke sweat on a sunny afternoon at Rod Laver Arena as she racked up 20 winners and beat the 57th-ranked 18-year-old in a breezy 67 minutes.
""As she was walking towards the net, I could tell she was quite upset,"" Williams told reporters. ""I kind of liked that. It shows she wasn't just there to play a good match, she was there to win. She wanted to win. That really broke my heart.
""I think she's a good talent. It's good to see that attitude.""
Yastremska rolled her right ankle midway through the match and took a medical time-out to have her foot bandaged when trailing 4-1 in the second set.
It stalled defeat only briefly, however, as Williams broke her a third time in the set and claimed the match when the Ukrainian sprayed a cross-court forehand wide.
Chasing her 24th Grand Slam title, Williams has conceded only nine games at the tournament and not dropped a set but may finally have a test when she plays the fourth round.
She will face the winner of older sister Venus and top seed Simona Halep for a place in the quarter-finals.
She mentioned Venus was one of the players that left her crying after defeat.
""I remember one time in particular against Venus at Wimbledon, as I was walking to the net, I started bawling,"" she said. ""I couldn't help it. Young girls, young women, just want to go out there and do their best and want to win.""
Since returning to the tour after maternity leave, Williams has yet to win a Grand Slam as a mother after two near-misses in the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
Seeded 16th in Melbourne, she felt torn about who she might like to play next but said a match against top seed Halep would test her true level.
""Yeah, and I honestly would love to face the world number one,"" she added.
""At the same time I would love for Venus to win. I think either way, regardless, I'll be ready for either opponent.

""Yeah, it will be great. I haven't played the world number one since I've been back, I don't think. So, yeah, it will be good.""

Maasarwe, 21, an international exchange student, was killed when walking home after a night out with friends in Melbourne earlier this week, with the police arresting the suspect on Friday.
The police would not name the suspect but local media identified him as an aspiring songwriter and rapper and a squatter. He appeared in court on Saturday and did not apply for bail. He has been remanded in custody to re-appear in court on Monday.
Maasarwe's death recharged outrage over violence against women after 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon was killed in Melbourne while walking home after performing at a comedy show in June.
Thousands of people gathered at vigils for Maasarwe on Friday and they continued to lay flowers at the site of her death. A special tram carrying only flowers late on Friday followed the route of Maasarwe's final journey.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who visited by the site of the murder with his family, said on Twitter he was to meet with Maasarwe's father who came to Melbourne. 
""I cannot imagine his loss,"" Morrison said.

Bashir, 81, who is considered the spiritual leader of the Islamist group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), was convicted in 2010 under anti-terrorism laws for links to militant training camps in Aceh province and jailed for 15 years.
President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election in April, has been criticised by opponents who question his Islamic credentials and accuse him of backing the ""criminalisation"" of clerics.
""The first reason is humanitarian. He is elderly and his health is also a consideration,"" Widodo told reporters, according to a statement from the social affairs ministry.
Widodo also cited security concerns, but he did not elaborate.
A legal adviser in Widodo's campaign team, Yusril Mahendra, said he had lobbied the president for Bashir's release.
""This shows to the public that it is not correct that Jokowi persecutes or criminalises clerics,"" Mahendra was quoted by Indonesia media as saying. Jokowi is the president's nickname.
Scores of the more than 200 people killed in the 2002 bombings of Bali nightclubs were Australian and Canberra has previously urged against leniency for Bashir.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday that he has been in contact with the Indonesian government.
""Australia's position on this matter has not changed, we've always expressed the deepest of reservations,"" Morrison told reporters in Melbourne. 
The Bali attack spurred Indonesia to set up its now elite anti-terrorism squad Densus 88 or Detachment 88, which received funds and training from Australia and the United States.
It was not immediately clear when Bashir would be released from prison in Bogor, a satellite city near the capital Jakarta, or what the terms of his release would be.
Bashir's lawyers said he was eligible for early release because he had served more than a third of his sentence, but he had refused to sign documents detailing the requirements for his probation.

Security officials have previously raised concerns about the cleric's influence in radical networks. In 2016, police moved him from a maximum-security prison on Nusakambangan island in Central Java to Bogor.

The report on the National Journal, Brazil's main nightly news program, said that the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF) had identified 48 deposits made into the account of former Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker and Senator-elect Flavio Bolsonaro, the son of President Jair Bolsonaro.
Each of the deposits, made between June 9 and July 13, 2007, was for 2,000 reais, and several of them were made in an ATM inside Rio's state legislative assembly, the National Journal said, quoting a COAF report it said it obtained exclusively. The COAF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news show quoted the COAF report as saying that it was impossible to identify who had made the deposits, but the fact that many were for the same amount suggested whoever had done so was trying to obscure the origin of the funds.
The latest revelation is a new embarrassment for Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who took office on Jan. 1 vowing to stamp out endemic graft and show zero tolerance to corruption within his government.
The supreme court this week agreed to a request from Flavio Bolsonaro's lawyers to suspend a probe into suspicious payments to his former driver, Fabricio Queiroz. Flavio's lawyers argued that, as a senator-elect, he now enjoys certain legal protections, including that any case involving him should only be decided by the top court.
The court's decision was widely slammed and handed ammunition to critics who noted that Bolsonaro and his politician sons have regularly railed against the immunity from prosecution that politicians enjoy - and which Flavio invoked.
The scandal arose last month when the COAF identified 1.2 million reais ($305,000) that flowed through the bank account of Queiroz in 2016-17. Some payments were made to the president's wife, Michelle.
Flavio Bolsonaro, his father and Queiroz have all said they are innocent of any crime. Jair Bolsonaro has said the payment to his wife was Queiroz repaying a personal loan.
In a TV interview on Friday, taped before the newscast, Flavio Bolsonaro defended his right to take his case to the supreme court, denied accusations he had been running a phantom employee scheme and said investigators had looked into his bank accounts without legal authority.

""I'm not hiding behind the right to immunity from prosecution,"" he said. ""I have nothing to hide from anybody.""

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 08:31PM ET</span>","Trump, North Korea's Kim to hold second summit in late February","By David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in late February but will maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang, the White House said on Friday after Trump met Pyongyang's top nuclear negotiator.
The announcement came amid a diplomatic flurry in Washington surrounding the visit of Kim Yong Chol, a hardline former spy chief, and marked a sign of movement in a denuclearization effort that has stalled since a landmark meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12.
""President Donald J. Trump met with Kim Yong Chol for an hour and a half to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. She said a location would be announced later.
The summit was announced even though there has been no indication of any narrowing of differences over U.S. demands that North Korea abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States and Pyongyang's demands for a lifting of punishing sanctions.
Sanders said that Trump's talks with the North Korean envoy were productive but added that the United States ""is going to continue to keep pressure and sanctions on North Korea.""
South Korea's presidential office said it expected the upcoming summit to be a ""turning point to lay the firm foundation for lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.""
South Korea will work with the United States and other countries to ""achieve concrete and practical results toward complete denuclearization and a lasting peace regime through the North Korea-U.S. summit...,"" presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement on Saturday. 
South Korea will also expand inter-Korean dialogue to help a successful meeting between Trump and Kim, he added. 
The first summit produced a vague commitment by Kim Jong Un to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but he has yet to take what Washington sees as concrete steps in that direction.
Nevertheless, both he and Trump had expressed an interest in arranging a second meeting, something some U.S.-based analysts see as premature. 
Critics of U.S. efforts say the first summit only boosted Kim's international stature without much to show for it, and some believe Trump may see a second meeting as a way of distracting from his domestic troubles.
Trump declared just after the Singapore meeting that the nuclear threat posed by North Korea was over. But hours before Kim Yong Chol's arrival on Thursday, the U.S. president unveiled a revamped U.S. missile defense strategy that singled out the country as an ongoing and ""extraordinary threat.""
Harry Kazianis, an analyst at the conservative Washington-based Center for the National Interest, called the agreement to hold another summit positive. But he added: ""Both nations must now show at least some tangible benefits from their diplomatic efforts during a second summit, or risk their efforts being panned as nothing more than reality TV.""
Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely site of the next summit. There has also been speculation about other possible venues, including Bangkok, Hawaii, or a return to Singapore.
TRUMP SEEKING 'WIN'?
A senior U.S. administration official said there was an exchange of letters for the leaders during the White House meeting, but gave no details of their content.
On his last visit to Washington in June, Kim Yong Chol delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump that helped overcome obstacles ahead of the summit in Singapore.
Kim Yong Chol, regarded as a member of Kim Jong Un's inner circle, also had talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. special representative on North Korea, Stephen Biegun.
A State Department statement said that after Pompeo and Kim met, the two sides had ""a productive first meeting at the working level"", and that Biegun would travel to Sweden at the weekend to attend an international conference.
The conference is also being attended by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. Washington has been keen to set up talks between Biegun and Choe but North Korea has resisted, apparently wanting to keep exchanges high-level.
South Korea's nuclear negotiator, Lee Do-hoon, also would attend the conference, the country's foreign ministry said, although it gave no indication of whether he would meet with Choe and Biegun.
U.S.-based analysts said that North Korea, which has developed missiles and nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, would likely be seeking a clearer message from the Trump administration on any concessions it may be willing to make.
""The North Koreans need a real indication of what the U.S. is willing to put on the table,"" said Jenny Town, a North Korea expert at 38 North, a Washington-based think tank.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that if North Korea took concrete steps toward abandoning its weapons programs, Washington could offer a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, humanitarian aid or a permanent channel for bilateral dialogue.
Victor Cha, a former White House adviser on Asia under President George W. Bush, suggested that Trump may be so desperate for a policy ""win"" that he could be vulnerable to a bad deal with North Korea.
""I worry that the timing works to North Korea's benefit,"" Cha said, citing pressures on Trump such as the partial U.S. government shutdown and the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian ties to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Earlier this month, Trump defended the stuttering progress on North Korea by saying that Pyongyang had stopped missile and bomb testing and if it had not been for his administration ""you'd be having a nice big fat war in Asia.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - White former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced on Friday to nearly seven years in prison for shooting black teen Laquan McDonald to death in 2014 in a landmark case that highlighted racial tensions in America's third-biggest city.
After a jury convicted Van Dyke of second-degree murder last fall, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Vincent Gaughan sentenced Van Dyke to 81 months in prison and said he would have to serve at least two years before he was eligible for parole. 
Van Dyke, 40, appearing unshaven and wearing a yellow-orange jail uniform in court, sat expressionless while the sentence was read. He had faced a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison for his second-degree murder conviction and up to 30 years for each of 16 counts of aggravated battery - one count for each shot he fired at 17-year-old McDonald, who was carrying a knife. 
In a statement he read before the sentence, Van Dyke called the date of the shooting ""the worst day of my life.""
""The last thing I wanted to do was shoot Laquan McDonald.""
Gaughan did not sentence him for the aggravated battery conviction, explaining second-degree murder was the more serious crime.
In his closing argument, prosecutor Joseph McMahon said between 18 and 20 years was an appropriate sentence and probation requested by the defense was not. 
The verdict in October marked the first time an on-duty Chicago police officer was held criminally accountable for the killing of an African-American and touched off celebratory street demonstrations in Chicago. 
The jury's verdict followed numerous acquittals or mistrials of police officers facing criminal charges across the country in the deaths of black men.
The hearing came a day after another judge found three of Van Dyke's former police colleagues not guilty of conspiring to protect him after he fatally shot 17-year-old McDonald.
Days of protests erupted in the third-largest U.S. city when a dashboard camera video of the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting was released more than a year later in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. 
The video also prompted the dismissal of the city's police superintendent and calls for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign. Emanuel is not running in next month's mayoral election.
Prosecutors showed the video repeatedly during the three-week trial. Jurors said they faulted Van Dyke for escalating the conflict when he could have waited for an officer with a non-lethal Taser weapon.
Police killings of mostly unarmed black men and teens elsewhere in the United States helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement and were a topic of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
Van Dyke testified in his own defense during his trial, saying he feared for his safety and fired because McDonald was advancing on him. Both the officer and his lawyers argued that the angle of the video did not reflect Van Dyke's perspective.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of mostly Honduran migrants entered southern Mexico on Friday, joining around 1,000 other people from Central America who crossed a day earlier and putting to the test Mexico's vows to guarantee the safe and orderly flow of people.
The cohort crossed the Guatemalan border into Chiapas state before dawn without needing the wrist bands that Mexican officials on Thursday gave migrants to wear until they could register with authorities, several migrants and an official told Reuters. 
""The road today was open,"" said Marco Antonio Cortez, 37, a baker from Honduras traveling with his wife and children, ages 2 and 9. ""They didn't give us bracelets or anything, they just let us pass through Mexico migration.""
A migration official at the entry point, who asked not to be named because she was not authorized to speak to media, said that at least 1,000 people crossed from Guatemala into Mexico before dawn, without putting on wrist bands.
Asked why migrants did not receive wrist bands, David Leon, the director of civil protection, said authorities faced a caravan of hundreds of people early in the morning and let them pass rather than risk a confrontation.
The migrant group proceeded on foot alongside cars on a highway, accompanied by federal police officers, arriving at a shelter in the city of Tapachula around midday.
Sitting by the side of the road rubbing cream onto his children's feet, 40-year-old Honduran migrant Santos Pineda said he and his family entered Mexico easily, and without having to provide documents or wear any wrist bands. The family's plan was to press on to the United States, he said.
A migration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those who entered without wrist bands ran the risk of being detained for crossing illegally.
Around 300 mostly Honduran migrants with wrist bands were still waiting to cross into Mexico on Friday afternoon.
Mexico's migration institute said the migrants can stay in temporary shelters in Mexico until they receive humanitarian visas allowing them to remain in the country, or they can wait in Guatemala for their document to be ready.
Groups of migrants left El Salvador and Honduras earlier in the week, the latest in a string of caravans of people largely fleeing poverty and violence. 
The caravans have inflamed the debate over U.S. immigration policy, with President Donald Trump using the migrants to try to secure backing for his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is pursuing a ""humanitarian"" approach to the problem, vowing to stem the flow of people by finding jobs for the migrants. In exchange, he wants Trump to help spur economic development in the region.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaragua's oldest and most-widely read newspaper published its Friday edition with a blank front page in protest against what it says is the government's withholding of ink, paper and other materials needed for its printing press since September.
In a Friday editorial, the La Prensa newspaper asked: ""Have you imagined living without information?,"" and complained that the government of leftist President Daniel Ortega had impounded its supply of printing materials for 20 weeks.
""We don't know how much longer we can keep printing the newspaper. Maybe two more months, maybe until tomorrow,"" Jaime Chamorro, director of La Prensa, told Reuters by phone.
Human rights organizations and independent media say the Ortega government is attacking freedom of expression.
The government recently shut down a broadcaster and held two reporters on terrorism and hate-incitement charges, while a judge ordered the arrest of three more.
The newspaper said customs agents at the behest of the government have been withholding imports of paper and ink in retaliation for critical coverage of simmering political tensions in the Central American country.
Since April 2018, Nicaragua has been experiencing one of its worst crises since a civil war in the 1980s. 
Protests raged for months before a government clampdown reined them in, but more than 300 people were killed during that time and over 500 incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, one of the groups the government has blacklisted.
Rights groups say four radio stations and one TV station have closed, while dozens of journalists have been beaten and threatened.
Nicaragua's customs authority was not available for comment on the accusations made by La Prensa. The government did not respond to a request for comment.

The Ortega administration maintains there is freedom of expression in the country and has accused the opposition of seeking to mount a coup to oust him.

May's demands continued to focus around either a legally binding time-limit for the Irish 'backstop'; a right for Britain to unilaterally withdraw, or a commitment to a trade deal finalization before 2021 to prevent the backstop from coming into force, the report said, citing unnamed senior EU diplomatic sources.
The backstop is an insurance policy designed to prevent the return of border checks on the frontier between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland.
May repeated her demands in talks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Irish leader Leo Varadkar, the paper reported.
On Friday night, May was also going to meet Arlene Foster, leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which has 10 seats in parliament and supports May's government but not her Brexit deal, a Telegraph reporter said on Twitter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is looking increasingly likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will not hear Trump administration appeals involving the ""Dreamers"" immigrants, transgender troops and gay rights during its current term, meaning rulings in these major cases may not come until next year.
With time running out for the justices to take cases to decide in their current term that ends in June, they took no action on Friday in those high-profile appeals. If they eventually agree to hear the cases but not until the nine-month term that begins in October, chances of rulings being issued this year are slim, a blow to President Donald Trump.
Under the court's normal procedure, Friday was the last day the court would add new cases to be decided in its current term. The last arguments of the term typically are held in April. The court could next act on whether to hear pending appeals on Tuesday.
The administration in several big cases has tried to get appeals to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible, putting its faith in a bench with two Trump appointees and a 5-4 conservative majority.
Appeals remain pending before the court on Republican Trump's 2017 move, blocked by lower courts, to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program implemented in 2012 by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
DACA protects about 700,000 immigrants, often called ""Dreamers"" based on the name of legislation that failed to pass Congress, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Most of the ""Dreamers"" are Hispanic young adults.
With the lower courts ruling against the administration and the high court not yet taking action, DACA remains in place.
The justices also have not acted on whether to hear Trump's bid to revive his restrictions on transgender troops in the military, also blocked by lower courts, and three related cases on whether gay and transgender people are protected under a federal law that bars sex discrimination in the workplace.
The employment cases focus on whether gay and transgender people are covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion. 
The court on Friday canceled arguments that had been scheduled for next month in the administration's appeal relating to its contentious move to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. census.
The administration had challenged the scope of evidence that U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan could use in considering his decision in a lawsuit filed by 18 U.S. states, 15 cities and various civil rights groups challenging the legality of the citizenship question.
The justices disclosed the cancellation of the Feb. 19 arguments in a notation on the court docket a day after the challengers, including New York state, filed court papers calling the administration's appeal moot because Furman issued his final decision this week invalidating the census question.

The Justice Department on Thursday said it would appeal Furman's ruling and it could seek to fast-track the case to the Supreme Court, but by Friday had not yet filed anything with the justices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American-born Iranian television anchor has been arrested as a material witness in an undisclosed U.S. federal investigation, according to a federal court order granted on Friday.
At the request of the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued the order, the first official U.S. confirmation of reports of the arrest of Marzieh Hashemi, an anchor for Iran's English-language Press TV news channel.
The order, which approved the partial unsealing of information in the case, said Hashemi was arrested on a material witness warrant issued by a federal judge and that she was assigned an attorney but ""has not been accused of any crime.""
Hashemi has made two court appearances, and the U.S. government expects her immediate release after she finishes testifying before a federal grand jury investigating violations of U.S. criminal law, the order continued.
It did not disclose further details of the case, which has added to tensions between the Iranian and U.S. governments over the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the reimposition of harsh U.S. sanctions, and the detention of Iranian-American dual nationals by Iran.
Iran has called for the immediate release of Hashemi, who state-run Press TV said was arrested on Sunday by the FBI at St. Louis Lambert International Airport.
The FBI and the Justice Department declined to confirm her arrest or comment on the case.
A U.S. government source told Reuters it appeared that the grand jury was examining whether Press TV is a propaganda outlet that failed to register with the Justice Department as an agent of a foreign government.
Press TV said on Wednesday that Hashemi was born Melanie Franklin in the United States and changed her name after converting to Islam.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was quoted by the INSA news agency as saying that Hashemi received Iranian citizenship after marrying an Iranian.

With Southeast Asia's largest defense budget, the wealthy city-state is a key prize for global arms companies as it looks to invest in new technology and upgrade its equipment.
Singapore's fleet of around 60 F-16 jets, which first entered service in 1998, will be retired soon after 2030.
""They (defense agencies) have decided that the F-35 would be the most suitable replacement fighter,"" Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. ""We want to procure a few planes first, to fully evaluate the capabilities of the F-35 before deciding on the acquisition of a full fleet.""
Ng said defense agencies would speak to their U.S. counterparts to move the process forward, but that it would take 9-12 months to finalize terms on the initial deal.
The F-35, one of the world's most advanced fighter jets, accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed's total revenue.
""We look forward to supporting them on their continued evaluation of the F-35,"" a Lockheed spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
The most common variation of the jet, the F-35A, costs around $90 million each, based on contract negotiations with the Pentagon in the United States.
While the price has declined with increased production, U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized it as too high, and have cited numerous production delays and cost overruns.
Other international customers have expressed interest in the F-35. Both Switzerland and Finland have competitions underway to select a new fighter jet.

Last year, all Lockheed Martin's U.S. and international F-35 fighter jets were grounded for engine inspections following a crash of an F-35B on Sept. 28 near Beaufort, South Carolina.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Friday urged both Russia and Ukraine to de-escalate the conflict in eastern Ukraine and said France and Germany were ready to help by monitoring naval traffic near the Crimean coast.
Speaking in Kiev after a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin, Maas again called for Moscow to release of the crews of three Ukrainian navy vessels it seized in November off Crimea. He said Russia must allow ships to pass through the Kerch Strait that leads to the Sea of Azov.
""All sides must contribute to the de-escalation of the conflicts,"" said Maas in Kiev after meeting with Lavrov earlier in the day in Moscow.
Klimkin welcomed the offer to monitor shipping traffic through the Kerch Strait. Lavrov told reporters President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for German experts to monitor the strait a month ago, but they had still not arrived.
It was not immediately clear if French participation had previously been offered.
Events in the Kerch Strait have exacerbated tensions between Ukraine and Russia over the Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and violence between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Maas bemoaned lack of progress in implementing the so-called Minsk peace accord aimed at ending the violence in eastern Ukraine, and also took aim at Kiev for what he called insufficient progress on combating corruption.
Despite its concerns over Russian actions, Germany has continued to back the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that has drawn criticism from Washington and some European states.
Maas said Lavrov had renewed Moscow's pledge to continue shipments of natural gas through Ukraine despite work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea.

Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is building the project jointly with Western partners Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Shell (LON:RDSa).

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",Thousands walk with coffin of murdered Polish mayor,"By Pawel Goraj
GDANSK, Poland (Reuters) - Carrying flags and candles in cold streets, thousands of Poles walked on Friday beside the coffin of Gdansk's former mayor Pawel Adamowicz who was stabbed on stage at a charity event.
The murder of a liberal critic of the ruling party's anti-immigrant policies highlighted the charged atmosphere in parts of eastern Europe where populist leaders have fanned nationalist sentiment.
A car drove Adamowicz's corpse slowly through the Baltic coast city from the museum of the Solidarity movement that helped to bring down communism in Poland 30 years ago.
From there, it passed schools, monuments and other places significant in 53-year-old Adamowicz's life, en route to the city's main church, St Mary's Basilica, for burial on Saturday.
The streets, in some places covered with thin snow, were blocked, as crowds paid tribute to one of Poland's longest-serving mayors who ran the city since 1998 and beat the candidate of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party in October.
""We all feel great emptiness after the mayor has gone, mostly because he left in such a way, such a town, such a moment. I think that a certain stage of history, of humanity, is over,"" said mourner Ewa Wasinska-Stelter, 46, a teacher.
Adamowicz was attacked on stage during one of Poland's biggest annual charity events and died the following day.
Polish authorities have arrested a 27-year-old former convict, named only as Stefan W., over the killing. Speaking on stage, the attacker accused the mayor's former party of putting him in prison, where he said he was tortured.
He was freed last month after serving 5-1/2 years for attempted bank robbery. 
Authorities have also detained at least 10 people in recent days over calls on social media to murder and other acts of aggression in the wake of Adamowicz's death. 
Critics blame Poland's politicians for cranking up hate speech in public life.
Adamowicz was one of 11 Polish mayors targeted with fake death certificates by a far-right group called All-Polish Youth in 2017, after signing a declaration to welcome refugees in opposition to government policy. 
Support for the conservative PiS fell to 30 percent in the wake of Adamowicz's death, according to a poll conducted by Kantar Millward Brown for Gazeta Wyborcza daily, from 33 percent in November. The biggest opposition grouping Koalicja Obywatelska has 25 percent. 

As well as encouraging migrants to seek refuge in Gdansk, Adamowicz was known for backing a campaign to defend rule of law against what activists consider efforts by the PiS to increase political control over the judiciary and other bodies.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - In Tehran on Jan. 8 during a meeting with European envoys, Iranian officials abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol.
The French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats in the Iranian foreign ministry room had incensed the officials with a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil, according to four EU diplomats.
""There was a lot of drama, they didn't like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,"" one of the diplomats said. ""It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,"" a second said.
An Iranian official declined to comment on the meeting. 
The next day, the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran.
The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year. Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions, diplomats say. 
Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic's ballistic missile program, three diplomats said.
The new approach moves Europe closer to U.S. President Donald Trump's policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from which he withdrew in May.
Although there are diverging views in Europe, the shift could have consequences for President Hassan Rouhani's government as it looks to European capitals to salvage that deal.
    It could also strengthen anti-Western sentiment in Iran and lead to more aggressive Iranian moves around the Middle East, where the Islamic Republic is involved in proxy wars with its main regional rival Saudi Arabia.
Iran's firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on Sept. 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers. 
For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw, diplomats say. 
Tehran denies the plots and says the missile tests are purely defensive. 
""The accusations against Iran over the past few months have awoken a few countries in Europe that were against a tougher line on Iran,"" a European-based Middle East diplomat said.
The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017. Tehran denies any involvement. Then on Jan. 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran's intelligence ministry a terrorist organization, froze its assets and those of two men. 
""Take the Dutch for example. They had kept very quiet until the Danish attack and now they are more hawkish than the French,"" said the diplomat. 
Alarmed by Trump's ""America First"" policy, Europe considered his May 8 decision to pull out of the Iran accord a severe setback but Iran's international ambitions appear to offer Brussels and Washington a chance to work more closely. 
A U.S. State Department official said there was now ""a growing international consensus"" on the range of Iranian threats.
""The U.S. welcomes Europe's efforts to counter Iranian terrorism on European soil, its missile launches, human rights abuses, and other threats,"" the official said. 
DIALOGUE FALTERS
As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harboring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran.
At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran's role in Syria's war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen.
But multiple bilateral talks on the ballistic missile program have yielded no results.
The EU tried to show Iran that compliance with the nuclear accord would still mean economic benefits despite Trump's decision to reimpose U.S. sanctions and choke off Iranian oil exports by pressuring U.S. allies. 
The European Union is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months. It will be registered in France, run by a German and likely to include Britain as a shareholder. 
""There's a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran,"" another senior EU diplomat said. ""We thought we could get some effort from the Iranians in several areas."" 
Iran says Europe may not be able to safeguard the nuclear deal anyway and accused European officials of dragging their feet. 
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi said last week ""operational steps"" were needed from Europe as political support not enough.
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of Iran's powerful Assembly of Experts said on Thursday Europe ""would do nothing in our interest.""
""The Europeans are worse than the Americans. If not, they are not any better,"" he said, state TV reported.
EU DISAGREEMENTS
Last March, as part of efforts to convince Trump to stick to the nuclear deal, France, Britain and Germany proposed asset freezes and travel bans on the IRGC and Iranian companies and groups developing the missile program, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
Now, a similar set of measures is being prepared, three diplomats say. 
""We'd prefer not to take these measures, but they need to stop trying to kill people on our territory and over the last three years they have beefed up their ballistic program,"" said one senior European diplomat.
The diplomats say getting all 28 EU members to agree will take time.
The EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini, who helped seal the 2015 deal, is wary of moving too fast for fear of provoking a complete collapse of the accord, four diplomats said.
EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran's interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests. Diplomats said Mogherini wants to see the SPV established first.
An EU official denied any split in policy between Mogherini and EU governments, saying the statement will be published as soon as the SPV is launched. 
EU diplomats said eastern European governments could also go too far against Iran to please Trump in return for security guarantees against Russia.
EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe. 
Mogherini is unable to attend due to another official engagement, an EU official said, and it is not clear at what level France, Britain and Germany will be represented. 

""There are clearly risks in attending,"" another diplomat said. ""While we don't think Iran will withdraw from the nuclear deal, we don't need to force them into the abyss and deepen an arms race in the Middle East.""

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",North Korean diplomat arrives in Sweden to discuss U.S. deadlock,"By Daniel Dickson and Johan Ahlander
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son Hui has arrived in Sweden to take part in roundtable talks, Sweden's foreign ministry said on Friday, amid stepped up international efforts to end the stand-off between the United States and North Korea.
""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs can confirm that Choe Son Hui has arrived in Sweden to take part in roundtable talks in a smaller format together with international experts,"" a Swedish foreign ministry spokesman said.
A diplomatic source said the purpose of the meeting was to take steps forward in the relations between U.S. and North Korea after things ""ground to a halt"" following a landmark meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last year.
The source said earlier the talks had begun and had included Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea. But a State Department official said Biegun was part of meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea’s lead negotiator, Kim Yong Chol, in Washington on Friday.
Kim Yong Chol's visit is aimed at clearing the way for a second U.S.-North Korea summit and mark a rare sign of potential movement in a denuclearization effort that has stalled since the Singapore meeting.
The Swedish foreign ministry spokesman declined to say whether Biegun would be joining the talks in Sweden or whether the discussions had already begun. 
The meeting, which is due to last over the weekend, has been planned in secret for months.
Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, Cabinet Secretary Annika Soder and Sweden's envoy to Korea, Kent Harstedt, are also sitting in on the talks, the source said. 
Trump and Kim met in Singapore in June last year for talks aimed at finding a way to end a nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula.
Earlier this month, Trump defended the stuttering progress on North Korea by saying that Pyongyang had stopped missile and bomb testing and if it had not been for his administration ""you'd be having a nice, big, fat war in Asia.""

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:55PM ET</span>",How Kabila's election strategy unraveled in Congo,"By Giulia Paravicini, David Lewis and Aaron Ross
KINSHASA (Reuters) - In Kinshasa's lush Botanical Garden, the scene was set to celebrate the election of the man Joseph Kabila had chosen to replace him as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary's face beamed from yellow and blue banners, some emblazoned with the words ""Shadary President."" Soda bottles were piled up in a corner as Kabila's ruling coalition tallied results of that day's election at a nearby hotel.
Within hours of polls closing on Dec. 30, the planned festivities at the gardens were abruptly called off. 
As the results poured in from observers and thousands of electronic voting machines, it became clear to Kabila's camp that opposition leader Martin Fayulu had won by a decisive margin, diplomats and Congolese sources with direct knowledge of the events said.
Fraught discussions began in Kabila's team over whether to engineer a win for Shadary, a former interior minister, or anoint a different opposition candidate who might be willing to protect the political and financial interests of Kabila and his associates, the sources said.
A week later, the electoral commission announced the election had been won by Felix Tshisekedi. Fayulu said he was a victim of fraud and the Catholic Church, which had a 40,000-strong team of election observers, rejected the official result.
Aides to Kabila, who succeeded his slain father in 2001, and Tshisekedi denied there was any tampering with the election results, as did the head of the commission charged with overseeing the poll.
""The results are those we announced,"" said Corneille Nangaa, president of the National Independent Electoral Commission. ""The rest is politics and useless speculation.""
Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, a Kabila adviser, rejected the allegations of rigging as ""pure speculation"" and Jean-Pierre Kambila, Kabila's deputy chief of staff, denied the president's camp ever considered trying to rig the vote in Shadary's favor. 
""This is pure imagination,"" he said. ""These are (accusations from) people who have lost and don’t want to accept the reality. 
But a Congolese source, who was in direct contact with senior government officials and members of the electoral commission as the debate unfolded, told Reuters that Kabila and his advisers realized quickly that the game was up. 
""Shadary's defeat was so blatant that not even the most sophisticated of the rigging was going to turn the results in his favor,"" he said. ""This is when Plan B kicks in: Felix President.""
FEAR OF VIOLENCE 
Kabila's aides feared that a Shadary win could provoke a violent backlash from opposition supporters who dominate in Kinshasa, the capital, and in several eastern regions of Congo, source of much of the country's vast mineral wealth.
A Tshisekedi win, on the other hand, would be more likely to garner international approval and might help keep the opposition divided, the source said.
Accusations of vote rigging are not new to elections in Congo. Foreign powers have overlooked alleged irregularities in the past for the sake of insuring relative stability in a country where two wars in the 1990s and early 2000s sucked in other regional armies.
But the scale of the alleged cheating in December's election stoked fears that the long-delayed vote, which was meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence, could degenerate into renewed street fighting or regional conflict.
The African Union and Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community held emergency meetings in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday, to discuss the election. The African Union called for the final results to be postponed, citing ""serious doubts"" about their credibility. But the Congolese government rejected the call on Friday.
The U.S. government, which has already sanctioned a number of top Kabila officials, has said it will hold accountable those undermining the democratic process. 
Fayulu -- who was backed by Kabila's two fiercest political rivals, Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi -- has called the result a ""coup"" and filed a challenge at the constitutional court. The court was expected to rule on the case by Saturday.
A member of Fayulu's camp shared figures with Reuters that he said were leaked from the electoral commission's server and showed its candidate with 59.4 percent of the vote, compared to just under 19 percent for both Tshisekedi and Shadary.
The figures were similar to those contained in a report by the Catholic Church bishops' conference in Congo, seen by Reuters, which was based on results collected by its observers.
Neither of the sets of figures is complete, and Reuters could not independently authenticate them. 
""WE CAN ALWAYS CHEAT""
In a change from elections in 2006 and 2011, Congolese authorities introduced electronic voting machines for the latest poll. 
The opposition feared the machines would be used to rig the vote but the government said it was a more efficient way to collect and transmit votes in the country of 80 million people.
Voters entered their selections on iPad-like devices, which were equipped with sim cards that allowed the final tallies to be transmitted via mobile phone networks to election organizers in Kinshasa as soon as the polls closed. 
The government ordered internet services cut on the morning of Dec. 31, saying this was necessary to preserve public order after ""fictitious results"" began circulating on social media. 
But by that time, figures had reached Kinshasa from most of the more than 60,000 polling stations, three Congolese sources and three diplomats briefed by election officials said.
Kabila's coalition, the Common Front for Congo, also had observers who recorded results at individual polling stations and sent them via phone, email or text messages for tallying at a Kinshasa hotel. 
By the early hours of Dec. 31, their figures showed Shadary losing heavily to Fayulu. 
""He is beating us everywhere,"" one coalition official wrote in a message seen by Reuters. ""We don't organize elections to lose them. We can always cheat.""
Two diplomatic sources said an election commission official told some foreign envoys in Kinshasa of Fayulu’s victory within days of the vote but said it was too dangerous for the body to announce it. 
Two other diplomats said commission officials made clear to them that Shadary had lost but said they were not informed of the winner.
""The government did not immediately abandon the Shadary option. However, they understood that it was going to be very difficult to make the population accept a Shadary victory,"" a Kinshasa-based diplomat said. 
""SEMINAL ROLE"" FOR KABILA
Representatives of Kabila sought a deal with Tshisekedi's team, Kinshasa-based diplomats and Congolese sources said.
An agreement was reached, they said, under which Tshisekedi would be president, Kabila would be guaranteed protection for himself, his family and assets, and his supporters would retain significant control over parliament and the financial and security apparatus. 
""What is certain is that Kabila will keep a seminal role,"" a senior Congolese government official said.
Tshisekedi and Kabila's camps deny such a deal was reached.
But Fayulu supporters question how members of Kabila's coalition won over 70 percent of the votes in provincial and national legislative elections when official results show their candidate, Shadary, won just 24 percent in the presidential vote.
Top officials instructed Nangaa, the electoral commission chief, to award the vote to Tshisekedi, two Congolese government officials told Reuters. Denying this, Nangaa told Reuters that no one put pressure on him to change the results. 
Kabila loyalists, especially in the military, did not trust Tshisekedi and wanted Shadary to be named president. They presented their concerns to Kabila's aides at a meeting on Jan. 9, hours before the official results were announced early on Jan. 10, said a businessman with access to the presidency and a Western security official in touch with the Congolese military. 
They said Kabila's aides assured the loyalists they would retain their positions and their interests would be protected.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:28PM ET</span>",Russia says new U.S. missile strategy will unleash arms race in space,"By Andrey Kuzmin and Christian Lowe
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday the new U.S. missile defense strategy would unleash a dangerous arms race in space and amounts to a relaunch of the Cold War-era ""Star Wars"" program.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a plan that envisages developing space-based sensors to detect incoming enemy missiles and exploring space-based weapons to shoot down missiles before they can threaten U.S. soil.
A statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the strategy as irresponsible and an act of confrontation, but made no mention of Moscow reciprocating with new plans to develop its own nuclear capability.
Instead, the ministry called on Washington to think again, backtrack from its plans and engage in talks with Moscow to find agreement on how to manage the world's nuclear missile arsenal.
""The strategy, de facto, gives the green light to the prospect of basing missile strike capabilities in space,"" the statement said.
""The implementation of these ideas will inevitably lead to the start of an arms race in space, which will have the most negative consequences for international security and stability,"" it said.
""We would like to call on the U.S. administration to think again and walk away from this irresponsible attempt to re-launch, on a new and more high-tech basis, the still-remembered Reagan-era 'Star Wars' program."" 
A renewed nuclear arms race would be a huge financial burden for Russia, whose economy is making a faltering recovery after years of low oil prices, a recession and Western trade sanctions. 
President Vladimir Putin's approval rating, while still high, has fallen from its peak in 2014, in part because of unhappiness about living standards and a drop in household incomes.
FINANCIAL BURDEN
The revamped U.S. missile strategy cited concerns about the burgeoning capabilities of Iran, Russia, China and North Korea and said this required a review of U.S. capability. 
It marked a departure from the approach taken by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to tamp down concerns among other major nuclear powers about expanding U.S. missile defenses.
Even before the new U.S. strategy was unveiled, Moscow and Washington were at loggerheads over missile defense.
The Trump administration has said it plans to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, on the grounds Moscow is flouting it. Russia though says it is in compliance, and that Washington is in fact in violation.
In its statement about the new U.S. strategy, the Foreign Ministry said: ""It is openly confrontational in character, and once again demonstrates that Washington is trying to secure for itself unrivalled military supremacy in the world.""
It said Russia had made repeated offers to Washington to negotiate about nuclear arms control, but that these offers had been ignored or rebuffed.
""We call on the U.S. administration to display political will and, once and for all, engage in a joint search for ways to resolve the problems that have built up in the strategic field, before it's too late,"" the statement said.
Russia has itself been accused of flirting with a new nuclear arms race, an allegation it rejects.
In March last year, Putin announced that work was underway on an array of new Russian weapons which he said could hit almost any point in the world and evade U.S. missile defenses.
The new weapons included a hyper-sonic, nuclear-capable missile called Avangard. Putin oversaw what the Kremlin said was a pre-deployment test of the new missile in December last year, and afterwards he declared it a complete success.
Defending his stance, Putin said he was not trying to trigger a new arms race but rather to stop that from happening. By developing weapons capable of evading U.S. defenses, Putin said, he was showing U.S. officials it was futile for them to beef up their own nuclear missile capability.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>",Brazil agriculture minister wants to open indigenous land to commercial farming,"By Jake Spring and Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil should open indigenous land to commercial farming, Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Friday, while also seeking to soften many of President Jair Bolsonaro's controversial stances on native people and the environment.
Farmers form a key base of support for right-wing firebrand Bolsonaro who since taking office Jan. 1 has placed pro-agribusiness policies at the center of his agenda. Activists warn his government's positions would strip away protections for the environment, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and indigenous peoples.
Reservation land covering roughly 12 percent of Brazil's territory is currently off limits for commercial farming.
""They could plant there ... and maybe have income for their community,"" Dias told reporters. ""They cannot do this today. That needs to be changed in Congress.""
Reservations should still be required to preserve a minimum percentage of native vegetation, as all farmers currently are, she said.
Bolsonaro has given control over indigenous land designations to the Agriculture Ministry, after arguing on the campaign trail that no new indigenous reservations should be created. But Dias struck a more moderate tone, saying Bolsonaro did not favor new reservations in areas that have long been settled by farmers.
""Small farmers that have been there 50 years and have deeds issued by the state or federal government, if you kick them out, there aren't conditions there for indigenous people to hunt and fish and have their lives,"" she said in a press briefing.
""When the president says he doesn't want more demarcations, he's talking about this type of contested areas.""
But the Amazon deserves completely different treatment, and tribes with little contact with the outside world should be protected, she said, a position that is shared by Brazil's new rights minister who will be responsible for indigenous affairs.
Bolsonaro has suggested Brazil may exit the Paris Agreement on climate change and appointed a foreign minister who calls global warming a leftist fabrication. But Dias said she is fine with staying in the accord, as the country is on track to meet its climate change goals.
As for a campaign promise to end the ""industry"" of environmental fines, Dias told Reuters prior to the briefing that Brazil must end ""indiscriminate"" fines levied by multiple agencies without working with the farmers to resolve misunderstandings.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Luxembourg's Asselborn says only second referendum would merit Brexit delay,"By Michele Sinner
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Luxembourg's veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn on Friday said only a move toward a second referendum could win Britain a delay of the current Brexit date at the end of March.
A dedicated European Union federalist known for speaking his mind, Asselborn made his comments while outlining with Prime Minister Xavier Bettel their country's preparations for the most damaging no-deal Brexit scenario.
Since British lawmakers struck down Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal negotiated with the EU, expectations have grown that Britain would have to seek a delay to the original Brexit date to prepare for the new reality.
March 29 is the automatic deadline for Britain to exit the EU after a two year notice period under Article 50 of the EU treaty. Extending it would require unanimity among the other 27 EU member countries.
While many EU officials have suggested any such approval would come only with strings attached, Asselborn was very specific about what it would take:
""Only the initiative to hold a second referendum could be an indication to extend Article 50. Maybe it is a bit daring to say so. But it seems obvious that something strong needs to be behind the idea to tinker with Article 50.""
Prime Minister Theresa May is staunchly opposed to holding a second referendum on Brexit. Main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the option is on the table but has not backed it. But with no consensus in parliament on how to leave the EU, three of Britain's four living former prime ministers say a new public vote would be the only way out of the crisis.
Bettel highlighted the problem of how any Brexit delay would impact European Parliament elections due in May. 
""The ball is in London. They have to tell us what they want. We are currently in a situation where we still don't know which direction things are moving in, if there will be an agreement or not. The responsibility is in London,"" Bettel said.
In case Britain crashes out of the EU without pre-negotiated agreements on what is next, Luxembourg would give some 6,000 Britons living on its soil a year to obtain residence permits and let British citizens working in Luxembourg's schools and public sector keep their jobs, they said. 

Asselborn added the government would look next week at draft laws covering Luxembourg's financial sector in a no-deal Brexit contingency.

The unidentified man was taken to hospital after bystanders doused the flames that enveloped him in the same spot at the elevated top of historic Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ) where Jan Palach set himself ablaze in January 1969.
Palach's suicide was a desperate act aimed at lifting the apathy hanging over the country in the wake of the Soviet intervention in August 1968 in which Soviet tanks and troops occupied Prague, snuffing out the Prague Spring process of democratic reforms to the Communist system.
""According to initial information, a man born in 1964 poured an inflammable liquid on his body and set himself on fire,"" Prague police said on their Twitter feed. An investigation was under way. 
Paramedics put the man, who suffered burns over 30 percent of his body, into an induced coma before taking him to hospital, the Prague emergency service said.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Hundreds detained after Zimbabwe protests as U.N. denounces crackdown,"By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Zimbabweans arrested during anti-government protests were detained on Friday on public order charges, as the United Nations urged an end to a brutal security crackdown and an internet blackout.
The government has said three people died during the unrest that broke out on Monday after President Emmerson Mnangagwa raised fuel prices by 150 percent. Lawyers and activists say the toll was much higher and that security forces used violence and carried out mass arrests to quell the unrest.
Among the around 400 people charged by magistrates on Friday was pastor Evan Mawarire, a rights activist who rose to prominence as a critic of Robert Mugabe's rule and led a national protest in 2016. 
He will stand trial on more serious charges of subverting the government after encouraging Zimbabweans via social media to heed a strike call from unions. His lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she would lodge a High Court appeal for him to be released on bail. Mawarire faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.
The internet was blacked out for much of the day, until authorities began gradually lifting a ban that had disabled some electronic communications in the country since Tuesday. 
In Geneva, The U.N. human rights office called on the government to halt the crackdown and denounced allegations of ""generalized intimidation and harassment"" of protesters.
As life returned to a semblance of normality in Harare, civilians ventured outside to stock up on food and other supplies while police continued to patrol the streets.
Jacob Mafume, spokesman for the main Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition party, said he feared the web blackout was a prelude to more violence. ""The world must quickly step in to remove this blanket of darkness that has been put on the country,"" he told Reuters earlier in the day.
ECHOES OF MUGABE?
Authorities have yet to respond to the allegations of a crackdown, but many Zimbabweans believe Mnangagwa - a former Mugabe ally - is falling back on his predecessor's tactics by using intimidation to crush dissent.
The president has also failed to make good on pre-election pledges to kick-start the ailing economy - beset by high inflation and a currency shortage, and the trigger for this week's protests.
Referring to allegations of night-time door-to-door searches against demonstrators and beatings by police, U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said hospital medics had treated more than 60 people for gunshot wounds.
""This is not way to react to the expression of economic grievances by the population,"" she said.
One Harare schoolteacher waiting in a fuel station line said filling his petrol tank twice a month would now cost him $528 rather than $230.
""I will have to probably cut on some other things or simply decide not to drive to work,"" Gilbert Kepekepe told Reuters. 
While long queues formed at petrol stations and outside shops, the internet shutdown meant that Harare banks were providing only partial services and no cash machines were working, a Reuters witness said.

Leading mobile operator Econet Wireless said late on Friday it had received an instruction from the government to reopen internet access, except for some social media applications.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Missing ex-Interpol chief's wife wants asylum in France,"PARIS (Reuters) - Grace Meng, wife of missing former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei, applied for asylum in France fearing for her life, her lawyer said on Friday.
The boss of Lyon-based Interpol went missing in September after traveling back to his native China. France opened an inquiry and China said he was under investigation for bribery.
No word has been heard from Meng since a WhatsApp message to his wife on Sept. 25 saying ""wait for my call"". 
The website of France Info's radio station quoted her on Friday as saying that in recent weeks in Lyon she has been followed by strangers, received suspicious phone calls, and had her car license plates photographed by mysterious people.
""I need the French government to protect, to assist and help me and my children,"" she told France Info. 
""I am afraid I may be kidnapped."" 
Her lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told Reuters she had recently applied for asylum after being under police protection since soon after her husband's disappearance.
Meng, a deputy minister of public security in China, became president of Interpol in late 2016 amid a broader effort by China to secure leadership posts in international organizations.
Presidents of the international police organization are seconded from their national administrations. 
Interpol, which groups 192 countries and is usually focused on finding missing or wanted people, is run on a day-to-day basis by its secretary general Juergen Stock.
Interpol said Meng had resigned and elected Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as president in November.
French authorities declined to comment on the asylum request. It is unclear where Meng is being held and it has not been possible for Reuters to reach him for comment. 
China has said it protects the legitimate rights of all citizens, no matter what situation they find themselves in, and has offered to facilitate a call between Meng and his wife. 

Reuters could not reach his wife for further comment.

Chang, who denies wrongdoing, has been detained in South Africa since Dec. 29 at the request of the United States which wants him extradited. 
The charges relate to loans guaranteed by the Mozambican government, which it failed to disclose, signed off by Chang during his 2005-2015 term as finance minister. 
Mozambican authorities are also seeking Chang's extradition. The case has been postponed until Feb. 5 when the South African court will decide the way forward given the competing requests.
Chang's bail application has been dropped in the meantime but may be revived at a later date, a member of his legal team said.
""The bail application was provisionally abandoned, but Chang reserves the right to apply for bail,"" the lawyer Stiaan Krause told Reuters. 
If Chang is extradited to the United States, analysts say the case against him could unearth details of the national debt scandal, with potential implications for senior members of the ruling party ahead of elections in October.
Mozambique's acknowledgement in 2016 of the undisclosed borrowing prompted the International Monetary Fund and foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and a debt crisis that Mozambique is still struggling to recover from.
The United States also wants to extradite three former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) bankers from London and has arrested the lead salesman of Abu Dhabi-based holding company Privinvest in New York. It says all are also implicated in the fraud.
Lawyers for those individuals have not commented. 

Mozambique's Attorney-General's office has also indicted 18 people for their involvement, and said it will seek to have those charged in the United States and elsewhere face justice in Mozambique.

Prosecutors said one of those arrested was a Syrian citizen residing in Bulgaria who is suspected of sending money to people who back what they termed international terrorist groups.
The ring is suspected of sending money abroad via the traditional Muslim hawala system which uses individual brokers rather than banks. 
""The investigation is about crimes linked to terrorism financing,"" deputy chief prosecutor Ivan Geshev told reporters.
""The main suspect has been in contact and financed people engaged with providing logistics to international terrorist organizations and their financing,"" Geshev said, without naming the groups. 
The police raids happened at more than 50 sites and 26 cars in seven Bulgarian towns. They seized some 32,000 euros ($36,000), documents and other evidence. They were the culmination of a year-long investigation involving other European Union countries, the prosecutor said. 
He added that the investigation was not about any direct terrorist activities in Bulgaria.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>","Popcorn to hand, EU watches Brexit show but frets for own future","By Alastair Macdonald and Michel Rose
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiators are ""watching the BBC and eating popcorn"", in the words of one of them, as Britain's domestic rows over leaving make for compelling TV but frustrate Europe's hopes for a clean break.
Unsure whether Britain will crash out of the European Union 10 weeks from now, prolong the agony in the hope of salvaging an orderly divorce or even change its mind and stay, its neighbors are torn between ""Brexit boredom"" and a worry it is distracting from their own pressing problems as campaigning gets under way for EU parliament elections in May.
Hours after a packed and rowdy House of Commons tore up the deal Prime Minister Theresa May spent two tortuous years arguing over, only a few dozen of their 751 counterparts in Strasbourg showed up on Wednesday to hear EU negotiator Michel Barnier tell them all he could do is wait for Britons to make up their minds.
Several in the debate praised Britain's democratic history and were bemused by its poisonous meltdown over Brexit. Among them was Dutch conservative Esther de Lange: ""Collectively, they don't know what they want,"" she said of watching the Commons in action. ""But, boy, do they hold great speeches about it.""
Compared to a full house to mark the 20th anniversary of the euro, the EU currency Britain snubbed, the hundreds of empty seats around her were a mark of Europe's weariness with Brexit. 
But it also belied anxiety that paralysis in London will distract and divide leaders on other EU problems, from a slowing economy amid global trade disputes to deep divisions over money, migrants and Brexit-inspired Brussels-bashing by many members.
French President Emmanuel Macron says he does not want to ""waste time"" on Brexit as he presses to reshape the euro zone and the broader Union after the European elections in four months' time.
His EU affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said Brexit took up a third of her time: ""It's too much,"" she said, ""Because we have many other things to do in Europe than dealing with a divorce.""
""TIME TO MOVE ON""
Manfred Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who is leading the center-right campaign, said that ""Europe's door is still open"" should Britain decide to stay. But he told Reuters: ""It is now time to move on and get Brexit over with.""
Weber complained that a ""never-ending Brexit process"" had taken ""huge amounts of time, money and expertise"" from the EU.
""It has consumed valuable political energy, especially in this election year,"" he said, ""And has held us back from shaping a real positive European agenda for the future.""
Nearly three years after Britain's shock referendum vote to leave put supporters of European integration on the back foot, a push to regain momentum lies behind a summit of the remaining 27 leaders to be held in the Romanian town of Sibiu on May 9.
It was intended by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker to focus minds on a future without one of Europe's three biggest economies and two nuclear military powers, and be the culmination of efforts to end divisions threatening EU cohesion.
During last month's EU summit, which they hoped would be the last on Brexit, leaders were visibly weary of it: ""The fatigue was palpable,"" said one diplomat in the room. ""They don't want to be bothered with it. They want to get it over with.""
UNITED ON BREXIT, DIVIDED ON EUROPE
If there has been a positive from Brexit, leaders say, it has been the exceptional unity the 27 have shown in negotiation -- though a scary end-game could yet test that togetherness.
Many also believe turmoil in Britain has dampened appetites to follow suit, with European voters warming to the Union and euroskeptic governments, such as in Italy, Hungary and Poland, stressing their criticisms of the EU do not presage an exit.
Yet Sibiu and the EU elections on May 26 are set to expose continuing schisms on how to move the Union forward. Founders France and Germany disagree over tightening monetary union, as do Italy and its northern neighbors over sharing out migrants arriving by sea. Rich contributor states and the ex-communist east are split over filling a Britain-sized hole in the EU budget and over some eastern governments' maneuvering to stifle their opponents.
""On Brexit, the EU has shown exceptional unity -- if only we could show the same kind of unity on everything else,"" lamented one diplomat involved in preparing the summit.
One result of May's troubles could be that Britain is still a member come Sibiu and the EU elections -- a new headache that makes some wary of extending the Brexit deadline. Few, however, seem willing to force Britain out against its will -- yet.

Prolonging the process, though, is bad news, said an envoy to Brussels from a non-EU country. Leaders have tried to drive it down their list of priorities and ring-fence the negotiations in Barnier's task force: ""But Brexit sits around like a bad penny,"" he said. ""You can't ignore it. It's in your face and will continue to be in your face until it's resolved.""

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>","Turkey sentences detained judge who won human rights award to 10 years, Anadolu says","ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court sentenced a judge who previously won an award for human rights to 10 years in prison over links to the network Ankara says orchestrated an attempted coup in 2016, the state-owned Anadolu news agency said on Friday.
Murat Arslan, who has been detained for 22 months, was convicted of membership in an armed terrorist organization, after prosecutors charged him with use of the encrypted messaging app ByLock, Anadolu said.
Arslan has denied the charges and said any evidence that he had used the app was ""fabricated"", Anadolu said.
The government says the outlawed app was widely used by followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it blames for the attempted coup that saw rogue soldiers commandeer tanks and aircraft, attacking parliament and killing some 250 unarmed civilians. 
Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has condemned the coup and denied any involvement with it.
The Council of Europe human rights body in 2017 gave Arslan, who was detained at the time, the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize, a decision that prompted Turkey to say it would cut back its funding to the body.
Arslan was the former head of Turkey's Judges and Prosecutors Union, a civil legal association that was shut down by government decree in the wide crackdown that followed the coup attempt. 
Since the failed coup, authorities have formally arrested some 77,000 people and sacked or suspended more than 150,000 soldiers, civil servants and more over alleged links to the coup attempt, including alleged users of ByLock.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concern over the scale of the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan was using the putsch as a pretext to quash dissent.
The government, however, says the security measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threat it faces from Gulen's network.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>","Braving outrage, Swedish liberal Loof dumps partners to block populists","By Johan Ahlander and Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Annie Loof, leader of Sweden's Centre Party, has been called a traitor for her decision to abandon her center-right allies and back long-time political foe, Social Democrat leader Stefan Lofven, as prime minister after an inconclusive election.
The 35-year old, who has named former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher as a role model, once said she would rather ""eat her right shoe"" than help ex-union leader Lofven, whose Social Democrats have dominated Swedish politics for a century.
But on Friday Loof's Centre Party played a decisive role in allowing Lofven to win a second term by abstaining in a parliamentary vote on a new prime minister, ending more than four months of political deadlock. 
The reason for her abrupt U-turn is the rise of the Sweden Democrats, a populist, anti-immigration party with roots in the white supremacist fringe.
""The Sweden Democrats are a xenophobic party,"" Loof told Reuters. ""It is a party the Centre Party will not negotiate with nor cooperate with.""  
The Sweden Democrats have repeatedly denied the accusations and have adopted a zero-tolerance policy on racism.
The Centre Party and the allied Liberal Party will not join Lofven's new Social Democrat-Green coalition but will support it in return for pursuing such center-right policies as tax cuts and deregulation of the labor and property rental markets.
SWEDISH MODEL
The new government offers an alternative model to that seen in Norway, Denmark and some other European nations where mainstream parties have co-opted nationalist, populist movements, hoping to disarm them or capture their voters.
For Loof, who espouses free markets, liberal social values, generous immigration rules and individual freedom, that was not an option. 
At school in the 1990s, she shared a class with children of refugees fleeing wars in the Balkans, reinforcing her belief in Sweden's humanitarian responsibilities.
""There I got to know them and realized that no matter where you are from, you can become friends. That has shaped my views.""
Her economic views were shaped by an ethos of self-reliance and hard work she grew up with in southern Sweden.
Under Loof's tenure, however, the party - originally a farmers' union strong in Sweden's conservative countryside - has sometimes been out of sync with voters and even its own members. 
A policy outline from 2012 - a year after Loof became party leader - advocated open borders, flat taxes, and the right to take several spouses. It was withdrawn amid internal criticism.
Her decision to dump two center-right partners - the Moderates and Christian Democrats - in favor of Lofven will test whether voters are ready to abandon the traditional left-right divide in Swedish politics.
For some on the right, she is already a hate figure. 
Sara Skyttedal, the Christian Democrats' leading candidate for the European Parliament elections in May, called Loof and her liberal allies ""crooks and Quislings"". Vidkun Quisling was a Norwegian Nazi collaborator during World War Two. 
Loof's backing of the Social Democrats and Greens is fraught with danger as they are ideologically poles apart, despite the joint policy platform they hammered out this month.
""There are huge risks,"" said Fredrick Federley, a Centre Party member of the European Parliament and one of Loof's closest confidants.  
""If this deal does not deliver, I think we will see a conservative bloc run the country for many, many years."" 
The last time the Centre Party backed the Social Democrats, 25 years ago, it nearly dropped out of parliament in the following election. 
And with the Centre and Liberals gone, the rump of the old center-right Alliance grouping, the Moderates and the Christian Democrats, may begin forging new partnerships.
""The Alliance is now dead, and some of its remnants are now bound to look instead at the possibility of an understanding with the Sweden Democrats,"" said political scientist Nick Aylott of Sodertorn University.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>",Divisions overshadow Lebanon's Arab summit as few leaders come to Beirut,"By Ellen Francis and Angus McDowall 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Divisions among Arab states over Syria, and internal Lebanese disputes, have overshadowed a summit to be held in Beirut this weekend, with several leaders who had planned to come now staying away.
At least eight heads of state were originally expected in Beirut, said a source in the organizing committee, but only the Somali and Mauritanian presidents will now join Lebanese President Michel Aoun in attending.
A big point of contention, in a region plagued by bellicose politics, is whether to welcome Syria back into the Arab fold now that President Bashar al-Assad has restored control over most of his country.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, at a pre-summit meeting on Friday, called for Syria to return to ""our embrace"" in the Arab League after being suspended for seven years.
The group's secretary general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, was cited by Lebanese state media on Thursday as saying there was ""no Arab agreement over the return of Syria"". 
The issue has played into divisions inside Lebanon, as has a row over Libya's attendance, harking back to the disappearance of a Lebanese cleric there in the 1970s.
Lebanese leaders had hoped to agree a new government before the summit to showcase a fresh political dynamic after months of gridlock. But government formation talks drag on amid fears for the Lebanese economy.
Having closed down many Beirut streets, shutting schools and businesses in the city centre, the summit was on Friday portrayed in Lebanese media as a let down.
""The summit of excuses and Arab disappointment,"" was the headline in al-Jumhuriya daily newspaper. That of another daily, al-Nahar, was: ""Beirut's shock... a summit without presidents"".
Still, some of the 20 countries taking part in the Arab Economic and Social Development Summit are sending prime ministers, foreign ministers or finance ministers, and officials played down the notion that the meeting would be poorly attended.
""It doesn't take away from the importance of the issues (to be decided at the meeting),"" said the Arab League assistant secretary general Hussam Zaki.
SYRIA AND LIBYA DISPUTES
Although the economic summit has a lower profile than the Arab League summit, to be held in Tunisia in March, it still attracted numerous leaders when it was last held, in Saudi Arabia, in 2013.
Then, as now, Arab states were divided over the 2011 uprisings that toppled four leaders and led to three wars, over the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and over the role of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011, but some members are pushing for its reinstatement and others have reopened shuttered embassies in Damascus.
In Lebanon, where Syrian forces were present for about three decades, the extent of relations with Damascus remains controversial. 
Lebanon's powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah fought alongside Assad in Syria and wants Arab states to normalize ties with Damascus. Some other Lebanese parties are wary of Damascus' role. 
""No Arabs without Damascus,"" was the headline on Friday in the pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper. 
Meanwhile, members of the Amal party, a Hezbollah ally, on Sunday tore down a Libyan flag near the summit venue and burned it. They are angry over the disappearance of Shi'ite cleric Imam Musa al-Sadr while visiting Libya in 1978. 
Libya was then ruled by Muammar Gaddafi, who was overthrown in 2011, but Amal politicians accuse the internationally recognized government in Tripoli of not cooperating with investigations into Sadr's disappearance. 
The Libyan government has boycotted the summit in protest and pointed out that thousands of Libyans also disappeared under Gaddafi's four decades of autocratic rule. 
""I don't think this was necessary. It's just two or three presidents,"" said chocolate shop employee Mustafa Shatila in Beirut, bemoaning the closure of streets. 

""They've always convened here and other places and no firm decisions that come out... they'll be done in three days and leave as if nothing happened.""

MORONI (Reuters) - Comoros President Azali Assoumani has provoked anger by saying the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was an internal Saudi matter that did not warrant the international outrage it had triggered.
""What's wrong when a Saudi is assassinated in an embassy of Saudi Arabia?"" Assoumani said in reference to Khashoggi during a speech at a function on Thursday to launch the construction of a Saudi-funded road in the Indian Ocean island nation.
""I request that you transfer this (matter) to (Saudi) King Salman and tell him not to worry. Every day hundreds and hundreds of people die in the world and no one condemns it.” 
The Saudi ambassador to Comoros, Hamad Ben Muhammad Alhajiri, was present at the function and made no comment on Assoumani's remarks. 
However, the Comoros branch of the international francophone press association said it was dismayed by the comments.
""Comorian journalists solemnly ask the head of state to retract these remarks, which have shocked not only journalists but public opinion,"" UPF-Comores said in a statement.
""We wonder what awaits us in our country when our president publicly shows disdain towards the assassination of a Saudi journalist who was critical of the regime of his country.""
In 2018 media freedom group Reporters Without Borders ranked Comoros 49th out of 180 countries on its global press freedom index, but Comorian journalists complain they have been working under increasing restrictions in recent years. 
Saudi Arabia is a significant source of financial support for the impoverished Comoros, which cut ties with the Saudis' arch-adversary Iran in 2016 and with Riyadh's other regional rival Qatar in 2017.
Last year Saudi Arabia signed an accord with Comoros, an archipelago of some 800,000 people, providing $22 million to help finance water and road infrastructure works there.
Khashoggi, a longtime Saudi royal insider who had become a critic of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed on Oct. 2 in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. A global outcry ensued and led to U.S. Treasury sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals and a Senate resolution blaming Prince Mohammed.

A CIA assessment blamed the crown prince for ordering Khashoggi's killing, which Saudi officials deny. At least 21 Saudis are under investigation with five facing the death penalty over the murder.

The poet Katarina Frostenson and her photographer husband Jean-Claude Arnault, who was jailed last year for rape, have been at the center of turmoil at the Swedish Academy, which led to it awarding no Nobel Prize in literature last year. Two prize winners will be picked this year.
The Academy said it would pay Frostenson, who denied breaching secrecy rules, a monthly pension worth around $1,400 and rent subsidies in a settlement.
""Katarina Frostenson now chooses to leave the Swedish Academy,"" it said in a statement.
The Academy, founded in the 18th century to safeguard the Swedish language, picks the winner of the Nobel Prize only in the field of literature. Prizes in science, medicine and economics are awarded by other Swedish bodies and the peace prize winner is selected by a Norwegian committee.
Last year, Frostenson's husband Arnault was convicted of two counts of rape and sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison.
Arnault, who ran a culture institute that had dealings with the Academy, was also accused of having leaked the names of the winners of the Nobel prize on several occasions after learning of them from his wife. He denied the accusation.

Several members of the Academy left in the wake of the scandal. The Academy has since appointed several new members and set up a new prize committee, aiming to restore public confidence and retain the right to pick the winners of the world's most prestigious literary award.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's ""yellow vest"" protests have exposed a deep-rooted belief that society is not working for large swathes of the French population, especially outside major cities.
Driving the unrest is anger about rising living costs - particularly among low-paid workers - and a perception that President Emmanuel Macron is deaf to their needs as he presses on with reforms seen as favoring the wealthy.
The following graphics look at underlying economic and social indicators in France to try to explain why so many people believe the system is working against them.
IS THE FRENCH WELFARE SYSTEM GENEROUS?
Without welfare transfers, poverty and inequality in France would be among the highest in developed countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development http://www.oecd.org (OECD), the Paris-based group estimates.
While many protesters rail against what they see as a gulf between them and the upper echelons of French society, OECD data suggests that the wealth divide is not as bad as in many other rich countries.
France's extensive welfare system keeps the poverty rate at 14.3 percent https://tmsnrt.rs/2AGoAPs, below the 18 percent OECD average and on a par with Scandinavian countries known for their egalitarianism.
Without tax and welfare payouts, nearly 42 percent of the population would be living in poverty, the highest rate among OECD countries for which recent data is available.
Likewise, France's Gini coefficient, a gauge of income inequality, is slightly below the OECD average whereas without welfare transfers it would be among the highest, just behind Italy, Portugal and Greece, according to OECD data.
While a progressive tax system and generous welfare help narrow the wealth gap, it comes at a price as French taxpayers also bear the highest tax burden in the world https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oecd-tax/government-tax-takes-at-record-high-with-france-in-top-spot-oecd-idUSKBN1O411Y.
Tax cuts on wealth and financial assets early on in Macron's five-year term have added to middle-class taxpayers' frustration and he has been criticized as being a president of the rich. 
WHY DO MANY FEEL LEFT BEHIND?
Unlike Scandinavian countries, France's poor have little hope of improving their lot in life despite the billions of euros the government spends on them, according to OECD data.
The OECD estimates https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ruv0ef it would take six generations for a person from a low-income family in France to reach an average income compared with only two generations in Denmark and an OECD average of 4.5.
""There are no rungs anymore on France's social ladder,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, a conservative, said on Monday.
While six generations is on a par with its neighbor Germany, the French have a deep attachment to the idea that state institutions, from schools to courts to government, are supposed to offer the same chance of success to all.
But despite income support for those on low incomes, they have little chance of doing better than their parents, according to a study last year by France Strategie https://www.strategie.gouv.fr think-tank, which is linked to the prime minister's office.
The study found that a person whose father was a senior white-collar worker was 4.5 times more likely to belong to the wealthiest fifth of the population than someone whose father was a manual worker - largely because social origin correlates closely with one's level of education.
While France is close to the average in international education comparisons, it has a bigger gulf between the scores of the lowest and highest performing upper school students, the OECD's director of social affairs Stefano Scarpetta said.
WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE?
The protests originally erupted in November over higher fuel taxes, that have since been scrapped, and general frustration about the high cost of living, sparking the worst street violence Paris has seen in decades. 
With people on low incomes surviving on welfare handouts and the lower middle class squeezed by the tax burden, the French are highly sensitive to pressure on their daily budgets.
That helps explain a national obsession with purchasing power and French politicians are frequently judged on whether people are getting more spare cash.
While protesters largely ignored new tax breaks to boost purchasing power, official data lends credence to their claims that budgets are getting squeezed.
The pressure is increasingly coming from housing costs, which now absorb 23 percent of their budgets https://tmsnrt.rs/2RuHxhX compared with 10 percent a generation ago, according to the official French statistics agency INSEE.
Meanwhile, a lack of jobs, deindustrialization and dwindling public services mean that discontent is highest in smaller towns cut off from the economic opportunities of bigger cities.

In towns of 5,000-10,000 people, 21 percent report below average life satisfaction compared to 14 percent in the capital Paris, INSEE said in a study this week.

The Libyan National Army (LNA) faction killed Abu Talha al-Libi, a commander in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), together with two other militants, among them one Egyptian, in southwestern Libya, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said.
Al Qaeda and other militant groups have been using southern Libya as their base for attacks inside Libya and neighboring countries, exploiting a security vacuum which emerged after the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 rebellion backed by NATO air strikes.
The country now has competing governments operating in the east and west.
Reuters could not independently verify that Libi had been killed.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - International Criminal Court appeals judges delayed the release of Ivory Coast's former President Laurent Gbagbo on Friday, ordering that he continue to be held for at least two more weeks after being acquitted on charges of atrocities.
Gbagbo, who has spent seven years in custody in The Hague, was found not-guilty on Tuesday over allegations of involvement in election-related violence in 2010 and 2011 in which some 3,000 people were killed.
The trial judges had ordered him to be set free, refusing a request by prosecutors to extend his detention while they appeal the case.
The 3-2 decision on Friday by a five member appeals panel means Gbagbo and his co-defendant, former Youth Minister Charles Ble Goude, will continue to be held, at least until the appeals panel has reviewed the trial chamber's decision to release them. A new court date was set for Feb. 1.
""The detention of Mr Laurent Gbagbo and Mr Charles Blé Goudé shall be maintained pending the consideration of the present appeal,"" the ruling said.
In their earlier ruling to free the men, the trial judges said the prosecution case was ""exceptionally weak"" and that it was unlikely the acquittals would be overturned.
The appeals chamber backed the prosecution arguments that Gbagbo might not return for future court hearings if he were set free. Prosecutors noted that his wife, who is also the subject of an ICC arrest warrant, has been living openly in Cote d'Ivoire, and that the authorities there had made clear they would not ""send more Ivorians to the ICC"".
Gbagbo, the first former head of state to be taken into custody by the ICC, ruled Cote d'Ivoire from 2000-2011, refusing to stand down after his rival Alassane Ouattara was announced the winner of a 2010 presidential election.

After a period of post-election violence during which both men claimed the presidency, he was arrested by pro-Ouattara forces backed by France, and extradited to the Hague.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>",Former Afghan security adviser enters race for president,"KABUL (Reuters) - A former national security adviser entered Afghanistan's presidential race on Friday, seeking to unseat his former boss President Ashraf Ghani with the promise of a renewed effort to bring peace to the country. 
Mohammad Hanif Atmar, the country's top security official for four years before he quit in August over policy differences with Ghani, is seen by analysts as a leading contender in the election now expected in July. 
Announcing his candidacy in Kabul, Atmar said he welcomed peace talks with the Taliban but added he would not accept the return of a Taliban regime. 
""I definitely seek to have a change in the leadership and replace it with my 'Peace and Moderation Team' to bring peace to the country,"" Atmar told reporters.
The presidential polls will be a crucial test for election officials who were criticized for failing to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections last October. The 2014 presidential election won by Ghani was also tainted by accusations of widespread cheating. 
Two senior election officials said on Friday the vote could be delayed in order to prioritize peace talks between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban to end the country's 17-year conflict.
Ghani has yet to register his candidacy for a second term, but last month he brought two vocal critics into cabinet in what critics saw as a bid to neutralize potential opponents ahead of the election.
Ghani's office was not immediately available for comment on Atmar's decision to enter the race.
Atmar, who began his security career with the Soviet Union-backed government in the late 1980s, is still seen as close to Russia.
An ethnic Pashtun, Atmar worked for the KHAD, an Afghan security and intelligence agency with strong ties to the Soviet KGB. During the Soviet-Afghan War he fought against the Afghan Mujahideen, and lost a leg defending the eastern city of Jalalabad in 1988.
""He is a strong, charismatic candidate, but he does not enjoy the complete support of the U.S.,"" a Western diplomat in Kabul said.
""America's blessings are needed to be the leader of Afghanistan, especially now when peace talks with the Taliban are gaining momentum,"" the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

Taliban representatives have met with U.S. officials but have so far refused to talk directly with members of Ghani's government, which they consider an illegitimate regime put in place by foreign powers.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo rejected on Friday an African Union demand to delay announcing final results from its presidential election, compounding the turmoil surrounding a chaotic vote that many fear could fan widespread unrest. 
In a surprise announcement on Thursday, the AU called for the results to be postponed because of ""serious doubts"" over the conduct of the election, which was supposed to mark Congo's first democratic handover of power in 59 years of independence but which the runner-up candidate says was rigged. 
The final tally will be released once the Constitutional Court has ruled on challenges to the provisional results. It is expected to decide on appeals, including that of opposition leader and second-placed Martin Fayulu, on Friday or Saturday. 
""I do not think anyone has the right to tell the court what to do. I am not under the impression (the AU) fully understands Congo's judicial process,"" government spokesman Lambert Mende said. ""No country in the world can accept that its judicial process be controlled by an (outside) organisation."" 
The AU's statement said it would send a delegation to Congo to seek ""a way out of the post-electoral crisis"". The mission will include Rwandan President and AU chair Paul Kagame, Moussa Faki, chairman of the AU Commission, and other heads of state. 
Mende said the AU delegation was welcome, but that the post-election process would remain unchanged.
Provisional results announced last week showed a shock victory for opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi. But Fayulu requested a recount, saying he had won with over 60 percent of the vote and that Tshisekedi was announced victor only after striking a deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila.
Congo's influential Catholic Church said the official results were inconsistent with its own tallies. Three diplomats briefed on the Church's findings said they pointed to a clear victory for Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) country manager.
Both Kabila and Tshisekedi's camps have denied any such maneuver. They have also denied accusations of fraud. 
But the AU statement heaps more pressure on Kinshasa to address what independent monitors described as serious flaws in the process including faulty balloting machines and polling stations at which many were unable to vote.
An AU endorsement of the result is crucial for the legitimacy of the next president.
Congo, a vast and volatile country of 80 million people sprawling across central Africa, is the world's leading miner of cobalt, used in electric car batteries and mobile phones, and Africa's biggest copper producer.
But poor governance, endemic corruption and violent factional anarchy, especially in the east, have left many in poverty and dissatisfied with Kabila's 18-year rule.
Many Congolese are now concerned that the election dispute will fan widespread, violent disorder.

The U.N. human rights office said on Friday it had documented 34 people killed, 59 wounded and 241 arbitrary arrests since the provisional results were announced on Jan. 10.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:47AM ET</span>",Myanmar army kills 13 rebels in Rakhine clashes: military spokesman,"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar’s army has killed 13 rebel fighters in the western Rakhine State, a military spokesman said on Friday, as government troops battle to contain a new insurgency in the troubled region.
Fighting between security forces and the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group seeking greater autonomy for Rakhine, has forced some 5,000 civilians to flee their homes since early December, according to the United Nations.
The violence has brought fresh turmoil to the region, the site of a massive crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017, and represents another setback for the Buddhist-majority country’s embattled peace process.
""Between Jan. 5 and 16, 2019, there were eight clashes and five landmine explosions,"" said Major General Tun Tun Nyi, speaking at a rare press conference in the capital, Naypyitaw.
""Thirteen enemy bodies and three weapons were seized, and some soldiers died and were injured on our side,"" he said.
He declined to elaborate on the number of government troops killed, saying it was ""not necessary"" to give the figures.
The Arakan Army could not be immediately reached for comment, but a spokesman outside Myanmar previously told Reuters five bodies seized by the military did not belong to their fighters.
The recent surge of violence began after insurgents killed 13 police and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts on Jan. 4, as Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state media reported.
Myanmar’s civilian administration last week called on the military to ""crush"" the rebels, according to a government spokesman.
On Friday, the military said Aung San Suu Kyi, who runs the country as state counselor, personally ordered the crackdown, stating that the Arakan Army, which recruits from among the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group, should face the same treatment as Rohingya insurgents.
The military onslaught against the Rohingya in 2017, which the U.N. and Western nations have called ethnic cleansing, was preceded by attacks on security forces by fighters calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. The government denies the charge of ethnic cleansing.
""During negotiations at the president’s house on January 9, state counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said AA were terrorists and instructed to crack down effectively,"" Tun Tun Nyi said.
""If not, others would point out that ARSA was cracked down on because it’s from a different religion and AA was not because it is an ethnic group,"" he said.
A government spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.
The conflict is the latest crisis facing Nobel laureate Suu Kyi’s administration, which swept to power in 2015 promising to bring an end to the country’s myriad civil wars.
Myanmar governments have battled various autonomy-seeking ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements.

The United Nations has called for ""rapid and unimpeded"" aid access to the conflict zone, after the state government last week banned non-governmental organizations and the U.N. from five townships affected by the fighting.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 07:45AM ET</span>","In a first, Malaysia sues state over indigenous peoples' rights","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has filed a lawsuit against an opposition-run state for infringing on an indigenous tribe's land rights by handing out licenses to plantation companies to cut down timber, the first such action by a sitting government.
Deforestation over the decades has displaced some of the dozens of indigenous groups in Malaysia from their customary land. Property development and palm oil, rubber and more recently durian plantations have also encroached on their land.
Activists have criticized consecutive Malaysian administrations for failing to protect the indigenous groups.
In a statement on Friday, Attorney General Tommy Thomas said a civil lawsuit was filed against the state of Kelantan after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his cabinet decided to act on behalf of the Temiar tribe in the state. 
Thomas said the Kelantan government had granted logging licenses to private companies, and that these companies had entered the native land ""with heavy vehicles, clearing out truckloads of timber and vast areas of the forest to set up durian and rubber tree plantations"".
""The federal government is instituting legal proceedings on behalf of the Orang Asli in recognition of the federal government's constitutional and legal duty to protect and promote their wellbeing and advancement,"" Thomas said. Orang Asli refers to indigenous people of peninsular Malaysia. 
The Mahathir government was seeking legal recognition of the Temiar tribe's land rights and injunctions to restrain private parties from encroaching and destroying the land, Thomas said.
Five private entities were also sued, Thomas said, though he did not identify them.
The move could be seen as political as Kelantan is governed by opposition Islamic party PAS, but activists welcomed it as a first step.
""Research by Amnesty has found that indigenous peoples of Malaysia continue to suffer from a wide range of human rights violations, including an absence of formal recognition of their land, as well as threats, intimidation and violence when they seek to claim their rights to the land,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Malaysia researcher at Amnesty International.

LONDON (Reuters) - The mother of one of the British Islamic State militants, suspected of murdering western hostages, lost a legal challenge on Friday that it was wrong for Britain to assist a U.S. investigation which could lead to them facing the death penalty.
Britons El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey - two of a notorious group of British fighters nicknamed ""The Beatles"" - are being held by Kurdish militia after being captured in Syria last year.
The United States wants to extradite them and Britain has said it will not stand in the way of any future U.S. prosecution that would seek the death penalty, waiving a long-standing objection to executions.
Elsheikh's mother, Maha El Gizouli, had sought a judicial review, saying it was unlawful for Britain's interior minister to provide mutual legal assistance in a case which could lead to prosecutions for offences which carried the death penalty.
Her lawyers said the minister's actions were flawed, inconsistent with Britain's unequivocal opposition to the death penalty and violated her son's human rights. However, London's High Court disagreed and dismissed her claim.
The most notorious of the four of the so-called Beatles was Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", who is believed to have been killed in a U.S.-British missile strike in 2015.
He became a public face of Islamic State and appeared in videos showing the murders of U.S. journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, U.S. aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and other hostages.
""This group of terrorists is associated with some of the most barbaric crimes committed during the conflict in Syria,"" Graeme Biggar, Director of National Security at Britain's interior ministry, said in a written statement to the court.
Britain has said it does not want the men repatriated to the United Kingdom and their British citizenship has been withdrawn.
British prosecutors concluded they did not have the evidence to launch their own case against the men but U.S. officials then expressed frustration with the British stance of seeking an assurance that U.S. prosecutors would not call for the death penalty, court documents showed.
However, last June, British ministers and senior officials decided the best way of ensuring a prosecution and to protect U.S. relations was to seek no such assurance in this case.
""In this instance, and after carefully considered advice, the government took the rare decision not to require assurances in this case,"" Security Minister Ben Wallace told parliament last July.
That decision provoked criticism from opposition lawmakers and from some in the government's own party who accused ministers of secretly abandoning Britain's opposition to the death penalty.
Diane Foley, the mother of one of the murdered hostages, said she did not want the men executed in case that made them martyrs but sent to prison for life.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian police on Friday said 21 people were killed and 68 injured after a car bomb exploded at a police academy in Bogota in an attack that prompted fears of a return to the country's violent past.
In Thursday's attack, which the government described as an act of terrorism, the car broke through checkpoints into the grounds of the General Santander (MC:SAN) School before it detonated, shattering windows of apartments nearby. 
There has been no claim of responsibility for the blast, the deadliest since the government struck a peace deal with the Marxist FARC rebel group in 2016. 
President Ivan Duque called the explosion a ""crazy terrorist act"" against unarmed cadets and ordered police and the military to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice. 
""We will not rest until we capture and bring to justice the terrorists involved,"" Duque said late Thursday. ""I tell the criminals that social repudiation awaits them, the rejection of all Colombians and the international community.""
Local Caracol radio said that a suspect had been captured.
Investigators identified the car's driver as Jose Aldemar Rojas Rodriguez, who was among the dead, Colombian Attorney General Nestor Humberto Martinez said on Thursday.
The vehicle, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV, was carrying 80 kilograms (176 lb) of the high explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombian guerrillas, Martinez said.
Car bombs were frequent in Colombia during decades of civil war between the government and various leftist rebel groups, as well as in violence involving the Medellin drug cartel led by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar.
The worst of the war, which killed some 260,000 and left millions displaced, ended when the government reached a peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016.
The last major attack was in January 2018 when the biggest rebel group that remains active, the National Liberation Army (ELN), detonated a bomb in the northern port city of Barranquilla, killing five police officers and injuring dozens.

The ELN, made up of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States, has been in talks with the government since February 2017 to end the conflict. Duque, who took office in August, has said conditions for peace talks included the ELN suspending hostilities and releasing all hostages.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Armed groups have killed more than 100 soldiers and seized a huge stock of weapons in clashes in northeast Nigeria since Dec. 26, a report by a group of aid agencies said on Friday, weeks ahead of an election in which security is a campaign issue. 
Attacks had intensified over the past few weeks and forced thousands of people to flee to safer areas in Nigeria and over the border to neighboring Chad, the report said.
They have mostly been carried out by an Islamic State-allied faction of militant group Boko Haram. 
The surge has occurred in the run-up to an election on Feb. 16 in which President Muhammadu Buhari is seeking a second term, and his critics have seized upon security as an issue. 
Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler, came to power in 2015 promising to defeat the Boko Haram insurgency, which aims to creating an Islamic state in the northeast. Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) split from Boko Haram in 2016 and has carried out most attacks in the last few weeks. 
The report by the Global Protection Cluster in Chad, a group of aid agencies led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said: ""Raids against the Nigerian army have killed more than 100 Nigerian soldiers. According to the information available, the armed groups captured a huge stock of weapons.""
Nigerian defense ministry and military spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment.
The report said attacks in the Baga-Kawa area of northeast Nigeria on Dec. 26 caused more than 6,357 people to flee east into Chad and some 20,000 others to flee to safety within Nigeria.
Last month, ISWA seized the town of Baga, where a multi-national force formed by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger to fight the militants is based. The Nigerian army later regained Baga and said it had given ISWA a ""bloody nose"".
Boko Haram has killed about 30,000 people and forced about two million people to flee their homes since the insurgency began in 2009. 
ISWA has been responsible for attacks on military bases of recent weeks. In contrast, Boko Haram typically carries out suicide bombings and gun raids, though it said it carried out Monday's attack on the northeast Nigerian town of Rann.
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said on Friday that repeated attacks were ""severely affecting"" aid delivery to the 76,000 internally displaced people living in Rann. 
Boko Haram held territory in northeast Nigeria around the size of Belgium in early 2015 but was forced out of most of that land by troops from Nigeria and neighboring countries. 
""When this administration came, Boko Haram was holding 17 local governments in the northeast. They are not holding any local governments,"" said Buhari in a televised interview on Wednesday, when asked about his security record in light of recent attacks.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's parliament handed Social Democrat leader Stefan Lofven a second term in office on Friday, ending more than four months of deadlock after an inconclusive election that had allowed a populist party to threaten the traditional balance of power.
Sweden had looked set for a snap election until last week when Lofven agreed an historic deal with the Centre, Liberal and Green parties, bringing together parties from the center-right and center-left to prevent the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats from having a voice in policy.
""Ever more governments are becoming reliant on parties with an anti-democratic agenda,"" Lofven said after winning the vote in parliament. ""But in Sweden we stand up for democracy, for equality. Sweden has chosen a different path.""
The Sweden Democrats polled 17.5 percent in September's election, their support bolstered by voters' growing concerns about immigration amid a surge in shootings and gang violence in major cities.
While Sweden will now have a workable government that will keep the nationalist Sweden Democrats from any influence over policy, Lofven faces major challenges.
SHORT-LIVED GOVERNMENT?
The deal with the Centre and Liberal parties requires Lofven, a former welder and union leader, to cut taxes and deregulate the labor and property rental market, a sharp shift to the right that is likely to alienate many of his party's traditional supporters.
It also brings together parties that are ideologically poles apart, raising the risk that the government will be short-lived.
The Centre and Liberals - who dumped their partners in the four-party Alliance, the Moderates and the Christian Democrats, in order to secure Lofven a second term - face a backlash from center-right voters.
""The constellation that has chosen this prime minister is only united by one thing, a democratically dubious desire to exclude other parties from influence - not to let their votes count,"" opposition Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson said.
Lofven was supported by 115 law makers while 153 voted against him and 77 abstained. According to Swedish law, the nominee becomes prime minister as long as a majority of parliament does not vote against him or her.
The opposition Left Party abstained in the vote - as did the Centre and the Liberals - because it wanted Lofven reinstalled as premier, though it has threatened to cause him problems in parliament if they believe he has tacked too far to the right. 
September's election delivered a hung parliament with no major bloc able to rule without the support of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white-supremacist fringe.

President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Wednesday evening that a 20-hour siege had ended with security forces killing five militants who had stormed the hotel complex, forcing hundreds of people into terrifying escapes.
""The detectives are looking for a woman suspected to have ferried weapons from Kiunga through the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi,"" a police official who did not wish to be named said, referring to a region near the Somali border. 
On Wednesday, Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet said they had arrested two people in connection with the attacks.
The police official did not say when the other seven were arrested.
Al Shabaab, a Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate fighting to impose strict Islamic law, said it carried out the assault on the upscale dusitD2 compound over U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Kenya, the East African hub for multinational companies and the United Nations, became a frequent target for al Shabaab after Kenya sent troops into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to try to create a buffer zone along its border.
Sixteen Kenyans including a policeman, an American survivor of the Sept. 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States, and a British development worker were among the dead in the hotel 14 Riverside Drive complex attack.

Images of the bloodied bodies of five attackers were broadcast across social media as Kenyatta announced the end of the siege, which echoed a 2013 al Shabaab assault that killed 67 people in the Westgate shopping center in the same district.

Despite international condemnation of a crackdown that has killed thousands of Filipinos, visiting Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena told Duterte during a banquet this week that he wanted to ""follow your footsteps to control this hazard"".
Carlos Conde, Philippines researcher for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, said Duterte's campaign was ""a human rights calamity that no country in the world should even try to emulate"".
""No 'drug war' that treated the drug problem purely from a crime perspective has ever succeeded,"" he said. ""What they have wrought are untold suffering and the further destruction of the rule of law and the diminution of human rights"". 
The Philippine government has consistently refuted that and said the crackdown, which started in July 2016, was being administered lawfully.
On Friday, presidential spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said any allegations of state-sponsored killings were ""pure hogwash"". 
Police say they have since killed at least 5,000 suspected drug dealers, although activists say the number could be far higher and they dispute official accounts that the killings were all in self-defense.
More than 200 people in Bangladesh have been killed by police in a similar campaign. [nL4N1WO398]
International drug smugglers have increasingly turned to Sri Lanka as a transit hub in Asia, authorities there have said.
Predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka voted in favor of a U.N. resolution for a moratorium on the death penalty in 2015, but Sirisena said last year he wanted convicted traffickers caught arranging drugs deals from jail to be executed. 
Philippines human rights group iDefend said that if Sirisena was serious about following Duterte's lead, he should be ready to face scrutiny by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, which has started a preliminary examination into alleged crimes against humanity by Duterte.
""We warn Asian leaders not to emulate the Philippine model but adopt a humane, evidence-based public health approach to the drugs issue through a rights-based governance that strengthens, not erodes democratic institutions,"" iDefend spokesman Judy Pasimio said.

A spokesman for Sirisena did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SANDRINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth's 97-year-old husband Prince Philip was recovering at the couple's home in eastern England on Friday after escaping without injury when his car flipped over following a crash with another vehicle.
Philip was at the wheel of his Land Rover when it collided with another car on a road close to the royals' Sandringham private residence in Norfolk on Thursday afternoon, Buckingham Palace said.
While the woman driver and a female passenger in the other car which also had a baby on board needed hospital treatment for minor injuries, Philip was unhurt, although shaken.
""It was an astonishing escape for everyone,"" said Roy Warne, 75, who pulled the prince from the wreckage. 
""People could have been killed. The impact must have been enormous,"" Warne, who was driving home with his wife when he saw the collision, told TV reporters. ""He's a very brave man. He didn't make a big fuss about it and he went to ask everyone else if they were injured."" 
Witnesses told media the accident had occurred when Philip was pulling out of a driveway onto a main road, with pictures from the scene showing Philip's Land Rover overturned on the side of the road. 
Police said both drivers involved in the accident had been breath tested but neither were over the alcohol limit. Coincidentally, local councillors were due to meet on Friday to discuss safety concerns and lower speed limits on the road where the accident took place.
Philip retired from public life in 2017, although he still occasionally appears alongside his 92-year-old wife at official engagements.
Although he missed the traditional church service on Christmas Day last month, the former naval officer is said to be in good health and had a successful hip replacement surgery last year.
Royal commentators said Philip, who married Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by her side throughout her record-breaking 66-year reign, would be loathe to give up being behind the wheel of a car. There is no legal age in Britain to stop driving, but after 70 people must renew their license every three years.
He drove Barack Obama and his wife Michelle to lunch at Windsor Castle during their state visit to Britain in 2016, prompting the former U.S. president to remark: ""I have to say I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before, but I can report it was very smooth riding."" 

Outspoken yet intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for brusque comments and often headline-grabbing verbal gaffes during ceremonial events.

Islamic State (IS) made the claim in its Al Naba newspaper on Thursday evening, saying it was behind the explosion in the city of Magnitogorsk on Dec. 31 that triggered the partial collapse of a 10-storey apartment building killing 39 and injuring dozens. 
IS did not provide any proof to back its claim of responsibility, saying only that a ""security unit"" had planted explosives inside the building before safely withdrawing.
""The operation ...transformed the crusaders’ New Year festivities into funerals,"" the IS newspaper said. 
Russia's Investigative Committee said the claim should not be trusted and that investigators were still looking into what happened and studying all possible versions.
Their primary theory was that a gas leak was to blame, a statement said, saying that no traces of explosive or explosive devices had been found at the scene and that it was too early to draw definitive conclusions. 
""I suggest journalists do not trust statements from terrorist organizations, who as you know falsely take credit for all high-profile incidents in different countries,"" Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee, said in the statement.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 03:25AM ET</span>","India watchdog orders DP, Maersk units to withdraw some notices to clients at Mumbai port","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust watchdog has ordered Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk and Dubai's DP World to withdraw certain customer advisories which it said could hamper growth of the country's largest container port in Mumbai, a document seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year ordered a probe into suspected antitrust violations by DP World (DI:DPW) and Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) units at the terminals they operate at state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
Handling 66 million tonnes of cargo in the last fiscal year to March, JNPT is critical to India's international trade. The port handles more than half of India's traffic in shipping containers each year.
The probe was ordered as the CCI found merit in a complaint filed by Singapore's PSA International Pte Ltd, which alleged the rival duo had created barriers to hinder the growth of PSA's terminal by colluding on certain charges they levy at the port.
Though the terminal operators handle each other's containers to help boost the port's efficiency, PSA had alleged that DP World and Maersk last year issued advisories aimed at discouraging port users from sending PSA's containers to their terminals.
In an order issued by the CCI on Jan. 15, the watchdog ordered Maersk and DP World units to withdraw those advisories, saying it ""smacks of anti-competitive"" conduct.
The advisories, if not withdrawn, would cause ""irretrievable damage or losses"" not only to PSA, and would not augur well for the port's development, according to the order. It has not been made public. 
""This is likely to generate unwarranted uncertainty, chaos, discontent and anxiety amongst shipping lines and customers,"" the CCI said.
The order is only an interim measure, and the wider probe continues.
A DP World spokesperson said the company had not received any such order from the Indian watchdog, but it was ""committed to ensuring"" it complies with all laws. 
A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, did not respond to queries. PSA, which is owned by Singapore government-owned investment fund Temasek Holdings, declined to comment.
The antitrust dispute at the JNPT is based on so-called inter-terminal transfers.
Under the system, freight trains arriving at JNPT typically carry containers destined for several terminals, but stop at just one that handles all the cargo on a given day. Other operators then collect their containers by truck for loading at their own terminals. A similar procedure is followed, in reverse, when imported containers are unloaded.
DP World's advisory had said the inter-terminal operations with PSA were ""inefficient and unviable"". Maersk had said its terminal ""shall not be responsible"" for handling containers to and from PSA-terminal bound trains.
Both the companies denied PSA's allegations while arguing to the CCI that the advisories were based on ""commercial justifications"", the order said.

Units of Maersk, DP World and PSA operate four of the JNPT port's five terminals, with the fifth owned by the government. The PSA terminal, inaugurated in February, is planned to be the largest, expected to nearly double JNPT's capacity.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 03:08AM ET</span>","Modi's pre-election handouts to cost India billions, breach fiscal targets: sources","By Aftab Ahmed and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A series of vote-catching measures planned by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he braces for a difficult general election may cost more than 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion), two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Much of the cost of the extra spending or revenue losses would have to be borne by the government that will take charge after the election due by May. The spending is also likely to delay plans to reduce the government's budget deficit, a key indicator of the nation's economic health.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost three major state elections at the end of last year, largely due to anger in rural India in the face of low crop prices and rising costs. Modi remains the front-runner for the general election, according to opinion polls, but his once-invincible image has been dealt a heavy blow.
The government is expected to unveil handouts mostly aimed at farmers in an interim budget to be presented on Feb. 1, said the sources, both government officials. While no final decisions have been taken, the measures could include direct transfers of funds into farmers' bank accounts and interest-free loans for them.
The giveaways will come on top of tax sops, job reservations and policies favoring local businesses that have already been made public. The new measures have to be announced before election dates are finalised by the Election Commission, possibly in March or April, after which there will be curbs on policies that could influence voting.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
The BJP's economic affairs spokesman, Gopal Krishna Agarwal, told Reuters this week that the party favored an expansionary economic policy that would give space to growth-boosting measures as inflation stays low. 
The BJP also does not consider the finance ministry's plan to keep the fiscal deficit to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in the current April-March fiscal year as ""sacrosanct"", he said, comments which pushed bond yields higher and hurt the rupee.
""Addressing farmer distress is the most important thing,"" Agarwal told Reuters. ""You need an expansionary policy. You chase growth in the economy, you do not chase these parameters like fiscal deficit.""
India's federal fiscal deficit was 5.9 trillion rupees, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in the 2017-18 fiscal year.
""PANIC-STRICKEN""
Since the state election losses, Modi's government has exempted many small businesses from paying taxes under a unified goods and services tax (GST), and is considering raising the income level at which people need to pay personal tax.
The government also plans to spend millions of dollars to add new seats in colleges and universities to accommodate a 10 percent quota announced recently for the less well-off among upper caste Hindus and people from other religions.
The Congress party, the main opposition, called it the reaction of a ""panic-stricken"" administration.
""Fearing an impending loss in the election, the government wants to bandage this crisis situation by giving interest-free loans and income-support schemes,"" said Gourav Vallabh, a Congress spokesman. ""Like all other schemes, this is a hurriedly prepared scheme by a panic-stricken Modi government.""
He said the countryside was in the throes of the ""worst agrarian crisis in 20 years"", because of Modi's shock ban on then existing high-denomination bank notes in 2016 and a chaotic implementation of the GST in 2017. 
TAX BREAKS, HANDOUTS
The interest-free loans for farmers, to be given by state banks who would be compensated by the government, could cost 120 billion rupees a year, the government sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as the discussions are not public.
""But this alone will not be enough,"" said one of the sources. ""We will need another 400 billion for various schemes that we need to top that with.""
They said the personal and commercial tax concessions could lead to a revenue loss of up to 250 billion rupees. This would include a proposed GST rate cut for cement to 18 percent from 28 percent that would lead to an annual revenue loss of 130 billion rupees.
The sources also said giving 2,000-4,000 rupees per hectare to land-owning farmers was another option being considered, which would be ""costly but effective"".
That alone could cost more than 1 trillion rupees, they said, but if implemented, the government may not go for other measures like interest-free loans.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to pay the government a dividend of up to 400 billion rupees by March, Reuters reported earlier this month citing sources, but that will far from make up the difference.
Moody's Investors Service has already said India's federal fiscal deficit target could slip to about 3.4 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year because of revenue shortfalls from GST collections, lower excise duty and below-target government asset sales.
Many Indian states have also let their financial discipline slip, especially around the time of elections, economists say.
Moody's said India's combined federal and state government fiscal deficit was about 6.6 percent of GDP in the last fiscal year, significantly higher than the median of 2.6 percent for countries that have India's Baa rating.
""Increased expenditure on income transfers, farm loan waivers or other forms of subsidies would weigh further on government finances,"" said William Foster, a vice president at Moody's.
The government's stated commitment is to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP by the end of March 2020, and to 3 percent by March 2021. Those targets could now be delayed, the sources said.
SIMILAR TO CONGRESS
Long seen as a Hindu nationalist party of the middle-class and traders, the BJP is increasingly adopting policies more associated with the left-of-center Congress.
Congress has ruled India for most of the more than 71 years since independence, and has been known for its subsidies, rural employment guarantee programs and a cheap food distribution scheme.
Since defeating the BJP in the heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh late last year, Congress has announced farm loan waivers in those states and has promised to do something similar across the country if voted back to power in the general election. It has also announced free housing and free food allowances for the poor, among other measures, in these states.
One of the government sources said the biggest financial impact of the federal government's planned extra spending would be seen in the next fiscal year, which could mean missing the short-term fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by 2021.
But he said the government was not unduly worried about such a slippage given that its financial discipline has been very good over the past five years.
This person added that the government was also expecting a Reserve Bank of India panel, led by former Governor Bimal Jalan, to recommend a less-conservative contingency reserve for the central bank, which could free up trillions of rupees for government use in the next 2-3 years beginning next fiscal year. Jalan last week declined to comment on his panel's planned recommendations.
""We can delay the medium-term fiscal targets since we have credibility with the target by a year or two and I don’t think markets should see this adversely,"" the source said.

Iran has called for the immediate release of TV anchor and documentary film maker Marziyeh Hashemian, whose employer, the English-language channel Press TV, said was arrested on Sunday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at St. Louis Lambert International Airport.
The FBI has not commented on the case.
""Marzieh Hashemi, detained by the FBI on unspecified charges, is due to appear in a Washington, DC, court on Friday,"" the state-run Press TV reported, without elaborating.
The broadcaster on Wednesday quoted Hashemi's son as saying that the 59-year-old journalist, who had been living in Iran for more than a decade, was detained as a ""material witness"" to a criminal case and no formal charges had been made against her. 
U.S. Federal law allows the government to arrest and detain a witness if it can prove that their testimony is material to a criminal proceeding and that it cannot guarantee their presence through a subpoena.
According to Press TV, Hashemi was born Melanie Franklin in the United States and changed her name after converting to Islam. She had traveled to the United States to visit her family, the channel said.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif condemned the arrest a ""violation of freedom of speech and unacceptable"". 
""She is the wife of an Iranian citizen and we see it as our duty to defend the rights of our citizens"" Zarif told Iran's Arabic-language state broadcaster Al-Alam news channel. 
In a statement on Friday, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on the Justice Department to disclose the reason for Hashemi's arrest. 
CPJ said in the statement that ""Iran routinely jails journalists, with at least eight behind bars in relation to their work when CPJ conducted its annual global prison census in December.""
Tensions have been high between Iran and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
Several Iranian dual nationals from the United States, Britain, Austria, Canada and France have been detained in the past years in Iran and are being kept behind bars on charges including espionage and collaborating with hostile governments.

TAIPEI/HONGKONG (Reuters) - Taiwan will step up its investigation of pro-Beijing newspapers accused by politicians on the self-ruled island of spreading fake news and surveillance activities that infringe national security, a security official said on Friday.
Claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory, Taiwan is China's most sensitive issue, with President Xi Jinping having stepped up pressure on the island since 2016, when pro-independence leaning Tsai Ing-wen became its president. 
Friday's remarks follow reports in a Hong Kong-based tabloid, Wen Wei Po, which adopts a pro-Beijing stance, on the activities of several Hong Kong pro-independence activists who traveled to Taipei last week.
Along with another newspaper, the Ta Kung Pao, the tabloid is known for its aggressive reporting to hound democracy and independence activists in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
""The work on foreign hostile forces has been our top priority,"" You Cheng-hua, the deputy director of a national security unit that reports to Taiwan's Investigation Bureau, told reporters. 
""We have been increasing our deployment and gathering intelligence."" 
You added, ""I also urge the public and media to help provide any tips on suspicious or illegal (activities).""
With Taiwan expected to hold a presidential election in about a year, Tsai has warned against Chinese efforts, including the deployment of ""fake news"", to interfere with domestic politics and elections.
""Chinese media organizations are doing surveillance in Taiwan,"" Lo Chih Cheng, a lawmaker from Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, told reporters. ""This has exposed a real national security problem."" 
Lo, who sits on Taiwan's Foreign and National Defense committee, added, ""I'm worried that 'red terror' is happening in Taiwan...They are following Hong Kong people today. Will they follow Taiwanese tomorrow?""
Earlier, Alex Huang, a spokesman for Taiwan's presidential office, said the Ta Kung Pao newspaper had engaged in ""unlawful"" acts through its surveillance of people, and added that it was spreading ""fake news"".
The newspapers, Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, offered no immediate response to Reuters' requests for comment.   
One pro-independence Hong Kong activist who was followed and reported on, Tony Chung, told Reuters he and two members of his group, Student Localism, flew to Taiwan on Jan. 11. 
The two newspapers on Monday detailed their meetings, movements, and even the books they browsed in a bookshop, along with photographs.
""The surveillance was very serious,"" said Chung, a 17-year-old high school student. ""It's quite terrifying that even in Taiwan we're followed 24 hours a day.""
Targets of the pro-Beijing media have also included those who are not citizens of Hong Kong or Taiwan. 
In December, Wen Wei Po carried a front-page story on an Australia-based academic, Kevin Carrico, sending a team to follow him around during a visit to Hong Kong. 
Carrico, who has done research on Hong Kong politics and the independence movement, was branded a ""separatist"" by the newspaper.

China's stability-obsessed Communist Party has long tasked the nation's police force with stamping out any form of grassroots social or political movement.
However, those efforts have intensified under Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has warned that China needs to do more to withstand ""Western"" influence that might undermine party rule.
China's police must ""stress the prevention and resistance of 'color revolutions' and firmly fight to protect China's political security"", Public Security Minister Zhao Kezhi said on Thursday, according to a post on the ministry's website.
""(We) must firmly defend our national security, with regime and system security at its core, and firmly defend the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our nation's Socialist system,"" he said.
Police must also ""strike back against all kinds of infiltration and subversive activities by hostile foreign forces"", he told the ministry's annual national meeting.
The term ""color revolution"" refers to popular uprisings experienced by former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, that often swept away long-established rulers.
Chinese officials have previously mentioned such uprisings as a warning to their own people about the trouble that might result from overthrowing long-standing governments.
China's domestic security budget has not been detailed by the government in its annual work report since 2014, after the figure outstripped the military budget three years in a row. 
Analyst estimates suggest spending has continued to soar, with security-related construction tripling in 2017 in the far western region of Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands of individuals from Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in camps as part of a ""de-radicalization"" drive.

Government procurement documents suggest that China's police have also increased spending across China as they adopt new high-tech devices, such as phone scanners, to help surveillance.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2019 12:13AM ET</span>",Australian police arrest man after killing of Israeli woman studying in Melbourne,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A 20-year-old man was arrested over the killing of an Israeli university student who was walking home after a night out with friends in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, police said on Friday.
Homicide detectives took the man into custody as part of an investigation into the killing of Aiia Maasarwe, 21, whose body was found by passers-by near La Trobe University early on Wednesday, Victoria state police said in a statement.
No other details about the man were released.
The arrest came hours before a vigil for Maasarwe, which thousands of people were expected to attend.
Maasarwe was attacked as she returned to the university's campus in Melbourne's northeast, where she had been on a study abroad program, after watching a comedy show. Police described her as an Israeli national.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered Maasarwe's family his heartfelt condolences.
""We must remain vigilant ... I'm so sickened by the attack and frankly disturbed by it, as I'm sure Australians are all around the country,"" Morrison told reporters in Fiji, where he was winding up a Pacific tour.
He said his centre-right coalition government would announce another ""action plan"" to stem violence against women ahead of an election expected by May, on top of A$350 million ($252 million) that has already been committed. 
Maasarwe's father is in Melbourne but it was not clear if he would attend the vigil. People have already begun laying flowers at an impromptu shrine that sprang up in parkland near a shopping center where her body was found.
She grew up in Baqa al-Gharbiyye, a mostly Arab city in the Haifa district of Israel, before moving to China to study at Shanghai University. Her father had a business in China, Australian media reported. 
A family member told Australian media this week Maasarwe had been talking on the phone to her sister in Israel as she walked home, a habit she formed so that she felt safer.
She was the second woman killed in similar circumstances in Melbourne in seven months.
Her death has recharged outrage over violence against women after 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon was killed while walking home after performing at a comedy show in June. 
The deaths have fueled a growing sense of frustration, particularly from women who say they are already vigilant and that men have to take responsibility for their own behavior as well as challenging the views and actions of other men.
""Nothing will change until we change, too. Until we stop blaming 'bad men' - while ignoring the sexist attitudes in our society that created them,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy has not ruled out sending an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait, despite military technology advances by China that pose a greater threat to U.S. warships than ever before, the chief of U.S. naval operations said on Friday.
Washington sent ships through the strategic waterway three times last year as it makes more frequent transits of the strait that separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland, but it has not dispatched a carrier in more than 10 years.
During that time, China has modernized its forces with missiles designed to strike enemy ships.
""We don't really see any kind of limitation on whatever type of ship could pass through those waters,"" Admiral John Richardson told reporters in the Japanese capital, when asked if more advanced Chinese weapons posed too big a risk.
""We see the Taiwan Strait as another (stretch of) international waters, so that's why we do the transits.""
Aircraft carriers, typically equipped with about 80 aircraft and crews of about 5,000, are key to the U.S. military's ability to project power globally. 
On Tuesday, a U.S. official told Reuters the United States was closely watching Chinese intentions toward Taiwan as advances in military technology give Beijing's forces greater capability to occupy an island it considers a breakaway province. 
In a report, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency called Taiwan the ""primary driver"" for China's military modernization. 
Richardson, who visited China before traveling to Japan, said he told his Chinese counterparts the United States was opposed to any unilateral action by Beijing or Taipei.
He also urged China to stick to international rules during unplanned naval encounters at sea. 
That request came after a Chinese destroyer approached the USS Decatur in October and forced it to change course as it challenged Chinese territorial claims in the contested South China Sea with a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP). 
""We have made this very clear that this was an excursion, a departure from the normal adherence to those rules and we would hope that behavior in the future would be much more consistent,"" Richardson said.
""We should not see each other as a threatening presence in these waters.""
The U.S. Navy continues to pass through waters in the South China Sea that Beijing considers its territory. 
On Jan 7, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer sailed within 12 miles of a Chinese-occupied island, prompting Beijing's rebuke that it had ""gravely infringed upon China's sovereignty"". 

China, which claims almost all of the strategic waterway, says its intentions are peaceful. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:45PM ET</span>",Former Singapore presidential candidate plans new opposition party,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A former member of Singapore's ruling party and presidential candidate said on Friday he had applied to set up a new party, making a return to politics ahead of an election expected as soon as this year.
Tan Cheng Bock's re-entry into politics could boost Singapore's weak opposition, while the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) prepares for the retirement of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong within the next three years.
The PAP has governed the global financial hub since independence over half a century ago, having never seen its vote share drop below 60 percent, and currently holds all but six of 89 elected seats in parliament.
Tan held office for the PAP for over two decades until 2006, and shot to prominence by nearly defeating a candidate backed by Lee in the 2011 presidential race.
Last year Tan was invited by a group of parties to lead an opposition coalition in the next election, due to be held by early 2021 but which Lee has hinted could come as soon as this year.
Prime Minister Lee, the son of Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, is nearly 67 and has said he will step down by the time he is 70.
""I have decided to return to politics after a long absence,"" Tan said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, adding he had filed an application to register a new party called the Progress Singapore Party. 
""Though we are setting up a new party, we still look forward to working with others in the opposition who are passionate about putting country first – before either party or self.""

The leader of Singapore's only opposition party with members in parliament, the Workers' Party, told a members' forum on Sunday there is a real risk it could lose all its seats.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States is likely to extend waivers from sanctions on Iranian oil imports in May but will reduce the number of countries receiving them to placate top buyers China and India and to decrease the chance of higher oil prices, analysts said.
Washington surprised oil markets after granting waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers when the sanctions on oil imports started in November. Benchmark Brent crude futures fell 22 percent that month and the waivers influenced the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) decision to agree in December to supply cuts starting in 2019.
Reducing the number of waivers will limit oil exports from Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC, but the United States is unlikely to meet its earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero.
China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran's crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said on Thursday. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list.
""Other geopolitical priorities will moderate the administration’s desire to halt Iranian exports, particularly with Iran's top two purchasers, China and India,"" the analysts said.
""The reductions will probably hit the Iranian economy hard especially because President Hassan Rouhani's administration is planning its budget around unrealistically high expectations for oil revenue.""
Asia's Iranian crude imports fell to their lowest in more than five years in November when U.S. sanctions took effect.
China and India continued to import Iranian oil from November while Turkey resumed imports in December.
South Korea is expected to receive condensate from Iran this month after a four-month halt while Japan's shipments are still pending banks' approval to process payment to Iran. 
However, the United States is unlikely to completely removed Iranian oil from the market because the loss of that supply would probably result in a politically unpalatable increase in oil prices.
""Given (U.S.) President Trump's public affection for low oil prices, and the difficulty of getting countries like China and India to completely cut back, the White House will likely settle for less than zero next time though they may be able to achieve a reduction of several hundred thousand additional barrels,"" Mike Tran, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said on Thursday in a note.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - One skier died and another was in critical condition on Thursday, hospital employees said, after being caught in an avalanche on some of the most challenging terrain at Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico, a resort known for its steep runs.
They were skiing down a chute off Kachina Peak, a 12,481-foot (3,804-meter) mountain about 130 miles (210 km) north of Albuquerque, when the avalanche hit at around 11:45 a.m., said Taos Ski Valley spokesman Chris Stagg.
""There were no others caught in the avalanche, it was just the two,"" Stagg added.
The ski patrol and other skiers dug the two men out of the avalanche and they were rushed to hospital, the ski resort said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The first was taken to Holy Cross Hospital in Taos, where he later died of his injuries, said a hospital employee, who asked not to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media.
Hospital spokeswoman Renee Laughlin declined to comment.
The other skier was airlifted to University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque and was in critical condition, said hospital spokesman Mark Rudi. 
""Our thoughts and prayers are with the two individuals who were affected by today’s event and their families,"" Taos Ski Valley said on its social media page.
Former New Mexico governor and U.S. presidential candidate Gary Johnson was among dozens of skiers who used ten-foot poles in a 45-minute effort to search the snow before the two men were found. 
""At least a hundred people were doing what I was doing,"" said Johnson, who lives in the Taos area, and regularly skis at the resort. ""Those guys could have been any one of us.""
Johnson and other rescuers spent hours after the rescue checking for another person feared to have been caught in the slide.
In each of the the last 10 winters, 27 people have died on average in avalanches in the United States, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said.
Taos Ski Valley's ski patrol had used explosive devices in the area on Thursday morning to reduce the threat of avalanches, Stagg said.
The rocky ""K3"" chute the two men were skiing down is accessed off a lift to the top of the peak. The lift was opened for the first time this season on Tuesday, after more than 16 inches of snow fell in the last week.
""It's very steep and challenging terrain,"" added Stagg. ""You like to think it's always safe, but sometimes there are pockets of snow that can avalanche.""

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:07PM ET</span>",NBA's Kanter urges Trump to act on Turkey's human rights record,"By Daniel Trotta
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Knicks player Enes Kanter urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be more vocal about human rights in Turkey, after prosecutors in Istanbul requested the basketball player's arrest and extradition over his ties to a U.S.-based cleric.
The 26-year-old center has been an outspoken critic of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his human rights record. He was indicted by a Turkish court last year on charges of belonging to an armed terrorist group, which he denies.
Istanbul's state prosecutor has sought an Interpol ""red notice"" to detain the basketball player and requested his extradition, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office said on Thursday. Interpol declined to comment.
Kanter describes himself as a close ally of U.S.-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, wanted in Turkey on suspicion of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016. Gulen denies the accusation.
Kanter said he had been receiving death threats because of his views and had decided to skip his team's game in London on Thursday, prompted by fears he may be harmed by Turkish government agents or by Erdogan supporters. 
""I feel like Trump definitely should talk about these issues with what's going on in Turkey because there are lots of reports of people getting kidnapped, getting tortured in jail, getting killed,"" Kanter told Reuters in New York City on Wednesday.
Turkish authorities have jailed some 77,000 people pending trial since the coup attempt, while 150,000 state employees including teachers, judges and soldiers have been suspended or dismissed in a crackdown on alleged supporters of Gulen.
Turkey says the scale of the crackdown is necessitated by the threat from Gulen's network. Some 250 people were killed in the failed putsch when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters in a bid to seize power.
Amnesty International said in a report last year it had evidence that some of those detained since the attempted coup had been subjected to beatings and torture. Turkish government officials have denied accusations of torture in custody.
A representative of the Turkish embassy in Washington directed queries about Kanter's comments to the Turkish foreign ministry. The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In an email, Robin Sirin, an aide to Gulen, said the cleric was ""unable to field interview requests right now due to ongoing health issues.""
Kanter said he had met with Republicans and Democrats in Congress but has yet to speak to anyone in the Trump administration and would welcome time with the president to discuss human rights in Turkey.
The White House declined to comment. 
Erdogan has said human rights in Turkey have improved in the 16 years he has been in power.
The 6-foot-11 (211 cm) Kanter said he had decided not to travel with his team to London for Thursday's game against the Washington Wizards at 2000 GMT (3 p.m. EST) before the report of the extradition request. He said he would watch the game from his New York City apartment.
""I'm going to put my double-zero jersey on and feel like I'm sitting on the bench with my teammates and I'm going to cheer for them,"" Kanter said. ""I want to feel like I'm in the game.""

The Knicks lost 101-100 to the Washington Wizards in the NBA London Game at the O2 Arena.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>","Nearly 1,000 Central American migrants in new caravans enter Mexico","By Sofia Menchu
TECUN UMAN, Guatemala (Reuters) - Almost 1,000 Central American migrants entered southern Mexico on Thursday in a test of the new government's pledge to manage an ongoing exodus fueled by violence and poverty that has strained relations with the Trump administration.
Mexico's National Migration Institute said 969 migrants from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua crossed into Ciudad Hidalgo just days after new U.S.-bound caravans of people set off from Central America.
Caravans from Central America have inflamed the debate over U.S. immigration policy, with U.S. President Donald Trump using the migrants to try to secure backing for his plan to build a border wall on the frontier with Mexico.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is pursuing a ""humanitarian"" approach to the problem, vowing to stem the flow of people by finding jobs for the migrants. In exchange, he wants Trump to help spur economic development in the region.
The U.S. government has been partially shut down for more than three weeks as Democrats resist Trump's demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion to fund his planned wall.
Mexican officials put wrist bands on the migrants as they entered the country to monitor the flow of people. The bands must be kept until the migrants register with authorities.
Once registered, migrants who met the requirements to stay would be issued humanitarian visas, allowing them to work in Mexico or continue to the U.S. border, said Ana Laura Martinez de Lara, director general of migratory control and verification.
Those who entered Mexico at the official border crossing had done so in a ""very orderly"" and respectful manner, in contrast to clashes that took place at the frontier in October when a larger caravan began crossing from Guatemala, she said.
Some of the migrants expected to stay in Mexico to find work but it was too early to say how many, she said.
Martinez de Lara said approximately 700 people were still waiting to cross into Mexico from Tecun Uman on the Guatemalan side of the border. She could not say if any people had tried to cross into Mexico illegally.

Mexico's government said Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard planned to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo soon for talks on their efforts to address the migration challenge. No date was yet set for the talks, a ministry spokeswoman said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A North Korean envoy arrived in Washington on Thursday for expected talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a possible encounter with President Donald Trump aimed a laying the groundwork for a second U.S.-North Korea summit.
The envoy arrived on the same day Trump unveiled a revamped U.S. missile defense strategy that singled out North Korea as an ongoing and ""extraordinary threat,"" seven months after he declared after his first summit with leader Kim Jong Un that the North Korean threat had been eliminated.
Kim Yong Chol, Pyongyang's lead negotiator in denuclearization talks with the United States, was due to meet Pompeo and could also go to the White House on Friday, a person familiar with the plan said, a sign of potential movement in a diplomatic effort that has appeared stalled for months.
The North Korean visit could yield an announcement of plans for another summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
There has been no indication, however, of any narrowing of differences over U.S. demands that North Korea abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States or Pyongyang's demand for a lifting of punishing sanctions.
Kim Yong Chol, a hardline former spy chief, arrived in Washington on a commercial flight from Beijing, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Yonhap and other South Korean media said he was greeted at Dulles airport by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.
Pompeo had planned to meet his North Korean counterpart to discuss a second summit last November, but the meeting was postponed at the last moment.
Diplomatic contact was resumed after Kim Jong Un delivered a New Year speech in which he said he was willing to meet Trump ""at any time,"" South Korea's ambassador to the United States, Cho Yoon-je, told reporters last week.
Kim Yong Chol was last in Washington in June, when he delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump that opened the way for the June 12 summit in Singapore. 
That meeting yielded a pledge from the latter to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and Trump declared the next day that there was ""no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea."" 
There has been little obvious progress since, however, which was underlined by the Missile Defense Review unveiled on Thursday.
Introducing the report, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan noted that North Korean missiles remained a ""significant concern."" Trump himself only mentioned North Korea in passing at the same event, saying negotiations he had conducted should have been done years ago.
""CONCRETE STEPS""
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged on Wednesday that efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal had not made headway.
""While the president is promising dialogue with Chairman Kim, we still await concrete steps by North Korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region,"" Pence said in an address to U.S. ambassadors and other senior American diplomats at the State Department.
Trump said on Jan. 2 that he had received a ""great"" letter from Kim Jong Un and would probably meet him again in the not-too-distant future, but there was no rush.
Pyongyang had stopped missile and bomb testing and if it had not been for his administration ""you'd be having a nice big fat war in Asia,"" he said.
CNN quoted a source familiar with the U.S.-North Korea talks as saying that Kim Yong Chol would be carrying a new letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump.
Kim Yong Chol will be the first top North Korean official to stay overnight in Washington since the late Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok did so ahead of talks with then-President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000.
Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely venue for a second meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un.

The Washington Post quoted people familiar with recent diplomatic activity as saying that if announced soon, the summit would probably take place in March or April, with the coastal city of Danang the most likely venue.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:52PM ET</span>",Ex-mistress of 'El Chapo' says she was 'traumatized' by tunnel escape,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former mistress of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman told jurors in his U.S. trial on Thursday she was ""traumatized"" after a harrowing 2014 escape from one of his safehouses with Mexican marines in hot pursuit.
Testifying for the prosecution in federal court in Brooklyn, Lucero Sanchez Lopez, a onetime local lawmaker in Guzman's home state of Sinaloa, also gave an emotional account of her relationship with Guzman, saying she at times feared for her safety.
""I didn't want for him to mistrust me because I thought he could also hurt me,"" Lucero Sanchez Lopez, 29, testified. ""I was confused about my own feelings over him. Sometimes I loved him and sometimes I didn't.""
She said once, while the two were eating dinner in 2012, Guzman told her that anyone who betrayed him would die.
Guzman, 61, who was extradited to the United States in 2017, has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. His trial has provided a window into the operations of the cartel, one of the world's biggest drug trafficking organizations.
The testimony by Sanchez Lopez is the first by someone with whom Guzman had a romantic relationship. Other cooperating witnesses have been business associates, primarily other drug traffickers. 
Sanchez served in Sinaloa's state congress from 2013 to 2016, when she was investigated for having shown false documents to visit Guzman in jail in 2014. She denied the accusation at the time.
Sanchez, who was nicknamed 'Chapodiputada' (Chapo deputy) by local media, was arrested in June 2017 on U.S. drug charges while trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. She pleaded guilty last October and is now cooperating with prosecutors.
She said her romantic relationship with Guzman began in early 2011, and that she began working for him shortly afterwards, although he never paid her. She described how he sent her to Mexico's ""Golden Triangle"" - a fertile drug-producing region that includes part of Sinaloa - to buy marijuana and send it back to him on planes.
Sanchez said the relationship frayed in late 2012 but she continued to see Guzman occasionally. She said she was with him in February 2014 when a team of Mexican marines stormed his safe house in Culiacan in the middle of the night.
Guzman, she said, led her into the master bathroom, where the bathtub lifted to reveal wooden steps leading underground.
""It was very dark and I was very scared,"" Sanchez said. 
She said she followed Guzman, who was completely naked, through a tunnel leading away from the house, feeling water against her legs. When a prosecutor asked her how long she was there, she guessed more than an hour - ""enough to traumatize me."" 
Sanchez' testimony followed an account of the same escape from the perspective of a U.S Drug Enforcement Administration agent working with the marines who stormed the safe house.
Though Guzman escaped from the house, the DEA's Victor Vazquez told jurors that he was captured several days later in a beachfront hotel in nearby Mazatlan.
Guzman would go on to escape from a Mexican prison the following year, before being recaptured in 2016.

Vazquez said knowledge of the 2014 capture operation was restricted to the team of marines, for fear of corruption among Mexican law enforcement.

The right-wing government of Bolsonaro on Saturday said it recognized Juan Guaido, a Venezuelan opposition leader who is head of the congress, as the rightful president of Venezuela - even though Guaido himself has not proclaimed himself president. 
Socialist President Nicolas Maduro began a new term last week under a cloud of international criticism by governments around the world, who have described him as an illegitimate leader whose policies have plunged Venezuela into its worst ever economic crisis.
""We will continue doing everything possible to re-establish order, democracy and freedom there,"" Bolsonaro said in a video, in which he stood next to the head of the opposition-appointed Supreme Court in exile, Miguel Angel Martin.
""We asked the people of Venezuela to resist and have faith, because I believe a solution is coming soon,"" Bolsonaro said in the video issued by his office. 
Guaido, a lawmaker from the hard-line Popular Will opposition party, said last week he was prepared to assume the presidency on an interim basis and call elections, but would only do so with support of the armed forces.
Since taking office Jan. 1, Bolsonaro has stepped up criticism of Maduro's government, the United States' biggest ideological foe in Latin America.
Also at the meeting was a representative for Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States who has said Venezuela should be suspended from the regional forum.
Bolsonaro's foreign minister Ernesto Araujo spent the morning huddled with a group of Venezuelan opposition leaders, led by the exiled former mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, to analyze the situation and Guaido's readiness to take over as acting president, a Brazilian foreign ministry statement said.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The meeting also discussed ideas for ""concrete action"" to re-establish democracy in Venezuela, the statement said, without giving further details. 
The opposition leaders said 300,000 people were starving and more than 11,000 newborn babies were dying each year due to the lack of medicine in what they called a ""silent genocide perpetrated by the Maduro dictatorship,"" the statement said.

Maduro, who says that a U.S.-directed ""economic war"" is trying to force him from power, has so far had consistent support from the armed forces at home.

Bolsonaro said some 11,000 doctors were being used as ""slave labor"" and demanded that the Cuban government, which took 75 percent of their salaries, allow them to be paid in full and have their families join them. 
Cuba refused and pulled the doctors out.
""Next week, we're going to have a special event that celebrates the arrival of 2,000 new community doctors that Cuba is sending us. They are coming from Brazil,"" President Nicolas Maduro said in a televised broadcast.
""Brazilian fascism ended the health plan, and the 2,000 doctors are coming to Venezuela,"" he said. 
Clinics run by Cuban doctors were a signature program of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who enjoyed an oil windfall during his 14-year rule that ended with his 2013 death from cancer. Venezuela paid for the medical services with shipments of oil.

Maduro, who has overseen a collapse of the once-booming economy, has faced growing complaints of decay in the health system and steady abandonment of the facilities once run by Cuban doctors. He did not give details about how Venezuela would pay for the doctors' services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's conflict with Democrats over a partial U.S. government shutdown escalated on Thursday with Trump denying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi use of military aircraft for an overseas trip in apparent retaliation for her suggestion that he delay the annual State of the Union address. 
The rising tension suggested that the shutdown, now in its 27th day, remains far from being resolved. 
In the meantime, the Trump administration continued to try to mitigate the shutdown's impact. The State Department said it would call its furloughed employees back to work next week for national security reasons.
Pelosi had been scheduled to travel on a military aircraft as part of a congressional delegation to Belgium, where NATO is based, and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. 
In a letter to Pelosi denying her delegation the use of a plane, the Republican president called the trip an ""excursion"" but the Democrat's spokesman said the trip to the Afghanistan war zone was for security and intelligence briefings. 
""In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,"" Trump wrote.
He told Pelosi she could make the trip by flying commercial.
Trump's intervention stopped the trip just as Pelosi and other lawmakers were about to travel.
The president later canceled his own administration's plans to attend the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had planned to attend after Trump canceled his own participation at Davos.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that in forcing Pelosi not to travel on a U.S. government jet, Trump had acted within his authority as commander in chief. 
""He postponed her ability to use military air, which must be approved"" by the Department of Defense, Sanders said.
A spokesman for Pelosi, Drew Hammill, said the trip to Brussels was intended ""to affirm the United States’ ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance."" 
The Afghanistan leg of the trip would have obtained ""critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,"" Hammill said.
A House Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that details of the trip were not supposed to be revealed for security reasons, as is customary. The White House, however, made the letter to Pelosi detailing the itinerary public.
A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Pelosi had requested and been granted Defense Department support for overseas travel, although the president has the authority to cancel Pelosi's travel.
At the Capitol, members of the delegation had already boarded a bus bound for Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, from which the plane was set to depart, when news of Trump's decision broke. 
It appeared to be a response to a letter Pelosi sent to Trump on Tuesday, suggesting he delay the annual State of the Union address to Congress, scheduled for Jan. 29, to some point after the government reopens. 
Pelosi cited concerns over the capacity of the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service to safeguard the Capitol during the event. The agency later said it was capable of securing the venue. 
Trump's action drew criticism from one of his Republican allies in the Senate. ""One sophomoric response does not deserve another,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on Twitter. 
He criticized Pelosi's move on the State of the Union as ""blatantly political"" but said, ""President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel to visit our troops in Afghanistan, our allies in Egypt and NATO is also inappropriate.""
Democratic Representative Elaine Luria, a first-year lawmaker and a 20-year Navy veteran, had harsh words for Trump. 
""The president’s comment that lawmakers visiting Afghanistan is a ‘public relations event’ is an insult to the brave men and women serving in harm’s way,” Luria said. 
Also on Thursday, the State Department said it would recall its employees and take steps to pay them salaries - a departure from other agencies. 
""As a national security agency, it is imperative that the Department of State carries out its mission,"" Deputy Under Secretary of State Bill Todd said in a statement. ""We are best positioned to do so with fully staffed embassies, consulates and domestic offices.""
Todd said the department's employees would be paid on Feb. 14 for work performed beginning on or after this coming Sunday. The department would review its available funds and ""legal authorities"" beyond the upcoming pay period to try to cover future payments, he said.
About one quarter of federal agencies have been shuttered since Dec. 22, with Democratic lawmakers refusing to accede to Trump's demands to pay for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
Trump is holding out for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month, have rejected his demands, saying there are cheaper, more effective ways of enhancing border security.
Before leaving for the weekend, the House passed another bill that would fund the government through Feb. 28, but the vote was later vacated and held over until next week after a procedural objection from Republicans. 

The Senate, however, has refused to bring any funding bill to the floor for a vote that Trump does not support.

Trump, who attended last year's Davos event, had planned to go again this year but pulled out last week as he grapples with Democrats in Congress over funding for a wall on the border with Mexico that has led to a partial shutdown of the government. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were expected to lead the U.S. delegation in Trump's place, two senior administration officials said this week.
""Out of consideration for the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay and to ensure his team can assist as needed, President Trump has canceled his delegation’s trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,"" Sanders's statement said.
Mnuchin and Pompeo had planned to speak jointly to the opening session of the forum on Jan. 22. They were also expected to jointly host a dinner of the Group of Seven foreign and finance ministers to discuss national security and economic issues. 

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also planned to be part of the delegation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government believes the Islamic State militant group is likely responsible for Wednesday's attack in northern Syria that killed four Americans, although it has not reached a firm conclusion, two U.S. government sources said on Thursday.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Pentagon and other U.S. agencies were investigating who carried out the attack in Manbij, Syria.
Officials studying the incident are not dismissing Islamic State's claim of responsibility for the blast, which killed two U.S. troops and two civilians working for the U.S. military, and regard it as plausible if not likely, one of the sources said. 
The attack occurred nearly a month after President Donald Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring Islamic State had been defeated there.
The Manbij attack appeared to be the deadliest on U.S. forces in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015 and it took place in a town controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
If Islamic State carried out the attack, that would undercut assertions, including by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence several hours after the blast on Wednesday, that the militant group has been defeated.
Experts do not believe Islamic State has been beaten despite its having lost almost all of the territory it held in 2014 and 2015 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq and declaring a ""caliphate.""
While the group's footprint has shrunk, experts believe it is far from a spent force and can still conduct guerilla-style attacks. An Islamic State statement on Wednesday said a Syrian suicide bomber had detonated his explosive vest in Manbij.
Trump's Dec. 19 announcement was one of the reasons his former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, resigned. It stunned allies and raised fears of a long-threatened Turkish military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria.
How and when U.S. forces leave has deepened uncertainty in northern Syria, with Turkey and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ready to fill the vacuum.
The U.S.-backed YPG militia that is allied to the fighters holding Manbij last month invited Assad into the area around the town to forestall a potential Turkish assault. Syrian army troops entered the area soon after.
The YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces vowed on Thursday to ramp up attacks on Islamic State remnants.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - China's envoy to Canada on Thursday warned Ottawa there would be repercussions if it banned technology firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from supplying equipment to Canadian 5G networks, the latest blast in a deepening bilateral dispute.
Ambassador Lu Shaye, speaking at a news conference, did not give details. Canada is currently studying the security implications of 5G networks, but unlike some allies has not announced Huawei equipment will be excluded.
""If the Canadian government does ban Huawei from participating in the 5G network, then as for what kind of repercussion there will be, I’m not sure, but I believe there will be repercussions,"" Lu said through an interpreter, urging Ottawa to ""make a wise decision on this issue"".
Relations between China and Canada turned frosty last month after Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, on a U.S. extradition request.
China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens, and this month a court retried a Canadian man who previously had been found guilty of drug smuggling, and sentenced him to death.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Beijing of arbitrarily using the death penalty and called world leaders to solicit their support.
Lu said when Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland went to the World Economic Forum in Davos next week she should avoid ""microphone diplomacy"" and not try to rally support.
""If Canada has a sincerity of resolving these issues, then Canada will not do such things. We hope Canada thinks twice before making any actions,"" he said.
In response, Freeland said Canada had no intention of changing its approach.
""We will continue to speak every day with our allies about this situation,"" she told reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet retreat in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
She declined to give details about the review into 5G technology. A Canadian source directly familiar with the case said the study would not be released in the immediate future.
Huawei has a relatively small Canadian operation, employing just shy of 1,000 people. But the company said early this year it had become the 25th largest research and development funder in Canada, thanks to partnerships with local universities.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei, ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) or other Chinese firms that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 05:18PM ET</span>",Car bomber kills 10 in Colombia police academy attack,"By Luis Jaime Acosta and Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded at a police academy in Colombia's capital Bogota on Thursday, killing at least 10 people and wounding over 50 in an attack that prompted fears of a return to the country's violent past.
Authorities said the car broke through checkpoints into the grounds of the General Santander (MC:SAN) School and exploded, shattering windows of apartments nearby. It was the deadliest attack in Bogota since the government struck a 2016 peace deal with the Marxist FARC rebel group.
President Ivan Duque called the explosion a ""crazy terrorist act"" against unarmed cadets and said he had ordered police and the military to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
""Colombians have never yielded to terrorism, we have always defeated it. This will not be an exception,"" he told a news conference at the school in the south of the city.
Investigators had identified the car's driver as Jose Aldemar Rojas Rodriguez, who was among the dead, said Colombian Attorney General Nestor Humberto Martinez. 
He said the vehicle, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV, was carrying 80 kilograms (176 lb) of the high explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombian guerrillas.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and Humberto Martinez said investigators were searching for its ""intellectual authors.""
The Defense Ministry said in a statement that 10 people were killed and 54 wounded. Nine of the deceased were cadets at the academy, police said.
A police helicopter hovered over the area and family members gathered, many crying as they sought information. Images on social media showed the remains of a vehicle in flames in the parking area, and emergency responders at the scene.
Car bombs were frequent in Colombia during decades of civil war between the state and various leftist rebel groups, as well as in violence involving the Medellin drug cartel led by dead drug lord Pablo Escobar.
The worst of the war, which killed some 260,000 and left millions displaced, ended when the government reached a peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016.
The last major attack was in January 2018 when the biggest rebel group that remains active, the National Liberation Army (ELN), detonated a bomb in the northern port city of Barranquilla, killing five police officers and injuring dozens.
The ELN, made up of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States, has been in talks with the government since February 2017 to end the conflict. Duque, who took office in August, has conditioned peace talks on the ELN suspending hostilities and releasing all hostages.
On Wednesday, the ELN said in a statement it had kidnapped three crewmen of a civil helicopter it ""neutralized"" last week. In response, Colombia's High Peace Commissioner, Miguel Ceballos, said the ELN ""was moving further and further away from the possibility of dialogue.""
There was no indication the ELN was behind the attack in Bogota or that the kidnapping was linked.

As violence has receded in recent years, Colombia has taken off as a tourist destination, with more than three million foreign visitors in 2017, up from one million in 2006.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>","U.N. members owe $2 billion in debt to peacekeeping, U.S. owes a third","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. member states owe nearly $2 billion in peacekeeping funds, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has warned, with the United States responsible for more than a third of that.
""Active peacekeeping missions are soon expected to face liquidity gaps due to late payments and increasing arrears,"" Guterres wrote in a Jan. 11 letter to the 193 member states. ""Arrears are nearing $2 billion and are likely to keep growing.""
Guterres also said that while 152 members had paid in full what they owed for a separate U.N. regular budget in 2018 - a record - more than $528 million was still outstanding. 
The United States is responsible for 22 percent of the $5.4 billion regular budget for 2018 and 2019 and more than 28 percent of the $6.7 billion peacekeeping budget for the year to June 30.
The United States owed $381 million to the regular budget as of Jan. 1 and some $776 million to the peacekeeping budget, U.N. officials said, figures the U.S. mission to the U.N. confirmed.
President Donald Trump says Washington is shouldering an unfair burden of the cost of the United Nations and pushed for the world body to reform operations. 
In December, the U.N. General Assembly agreed what percentage of the regular and peacekeeping budgets each country would pay for the next three years. 
The U.S. contribution to the regular budget is already limited to 22 percent and Washington unsuccessfully pushed to cap its peacekeeping contribution at 25 percent - as required by U.S. law - instead of more than 28 percent. 
""The lack of agreement on a 25 percent ceiling will cause the organization to continue to face a three percent shortfall in its peacekeeping budget,"" Cherith Norman Chalet, the U.S. envoy for U.N. Management and Reform, told the U.N. budget committee Dec. 22. 
This amounts to some $200 million, diplomats said. The United Nations has 14 peacekeeping operations, half of them in Africa.
""Current cash balances cover less than two months of operations, compared to four months last year,"" Guterres said of peacekeeping finances in his letter. Last year he twice wrote to warn states about the ""troubling financial situation"".
India's U.N. Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said the $2 billion shortfall was ""unsustainable.""
Some troop contributing countries ""are owed amounts equivalent to their annual assessed contributions for 100 years. Some even more,"" he tweeted on Wednesday.
The top contributing countries are Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Rwanda. They pay their troops according to their national salary scales and are reimbursed by the U.N. As of July 2018, the U.N. paid $1,428 a month per soldier. 

The United Nations says its peacekeeping operations cost less than half of 1 percent of world military expenditures.

LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth's 97-year-old husband Prince Philip escaped uninjured from a car crash while driving on Thursday near the Sandringham estate in eastern England.
Police said two people in a car that collided with that of the prince, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, were both taken to hospital for minor injuries but later discharged.
Pictures from the scene showed a Land Rover overturned on the side of the road. The accident occurred when Philip was pulling out of a driveway onto a main road, the BBC reported, quoting a witness saying he was very shaken.
Philip drove former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle to lunch during their state visit to Britain in 2016.
Buckingham Palace confirmed Thursday's accident. 
""The Duke was not injured,"" it added in a statement.
A palace spokeswoman later confirmed Philip was at the wheel and was checked by a doctor afterwards. He did not go to hospital and was now back at Sandringham, the private country residence owned by Queen Elizabeth in the county of Norfolk.
Famous for verbal gaffes but generally regarded with wry affection by Britons, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by his wife's side throughout her long reign.
Since retiring from official solo duties in 2017, he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the royal family at events and church services. 
He had successful hip replacement surgery last year.
The former naval officer did not accompany the Queen to a church service on Christmas Day last month though a royal source said he was in good health.
Kate Williams (NYSE:WMB), a royal historian, said it would be a blow to Philip if the incident ended his driving days. ""He really loves driving and takes a great pleasure in it and were he not allowed to drive he would find that quite painful,"" she said. 
There is no legal age in Britain to stop driving, but after 70 people must renew their license every three years.
Outspoken yet intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for brusque comments and often headline-grabbing remarks during ceremonial events.

A stray comment about ""slitty eyes"" during a visit to China in the 1980s became symbolic of his gruff and often unguarded manner. Even into his 90s, his off-the-cuff comments could still get him into trouble, such as when he exasperatedly swore at a photographer during an event in 2015.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>","In third year, U.S. women's marches turn to 2020 elections","By Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two years after filling the streets of U.S. cities to protest the start of Donald Trump's presidency, women will march again this weekend to try to build political pressure against him ahead of the 2020 elections.
The loose movement around the marches has splintered as it enters its third year, and one of the various groups now involved has faced criticism it is anti-Semitic, which it denies. But leaders of the groups say momentum has not slowed, and the rallies will celebrate unprecedented gains for women in congressional and state races in last year's midterm elections.
Millions of people took part in the women's marches in Washington and other cities in the United States and abroad on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after the Republican president was sworn in.
Vanessa Wruble, a co-founder of the original Women's March on Washington who left to start March On, a separate grassroots coalition, said the movement has evolved from being a reaction to Trump's presidency.
It was ""essentially the resistance movement, and now you see the movement being far more proactive,"" she said.
Women's March, a national nonprofit organization that evolved from the initial Washington march, is using its #WomensWave marches in Washington and elsewhere on Saturday to roll out a 10-part policy platform that includes raising the federal minimum wage and protecting reproductive rights.
""Women are just not on the agenda in this current administration,"" Women's March Chief Operating Officer Rachel Carmona said.
March On will kick off an initiative to mobilize women voters by hosting a ""March on the Polls 2020"" on Saturday in dozens of cities, including Boston and Denver. 
Dozens of like-minded organizations will host training sessions for activists and prospective candidates.
More than 400 women have applied to attend a candidate training session this weekend in Washington hosted by Emily's List, an organization that works to elect women who support abortion rights, said spokeswoman Tonya Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Wruble said the 2018 elections showed the movement had ""shifted the balance of power"" in American politics. More women were elected to the U.S. Congress than ever before and many of the new Democratic women lawmakers cited Trump's presidency among the reasons they decided to run for office.
Of course, women are not all united around the same causes. The annual ""March for Life"" by anti-abortion campaigners, which takes place in Washington on Friday, is a movement of people who broadly embrace Trump and Republicans.
GRASS-ROOTS EFFORTS
At the outset, March On was bankrolled by leaders covering expenses out of pocket, but it raised a ""sizeable"" amount of money in 2018 and aims to raise $2 million in 2019, Wruble said.
March On distributes funds to local affiliates for on-the-ground planning, provides design assistance for websites and logos and gives access to a public relations firm. In February and March, the group's leaders will meet with affiliates to determine how best to support their efforts over the next election cycle.
""This year is really going to be about increasing our tool chest of what we offer to them,"" said March On's Natalie Sanchez, an organizer of the 2017 Boston Women's March who is also with March Forward Massachusetts, which is leading Saturday's march there.
The Women's March now counts national progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Move On among its partners. March On partners include the ACLU, Rock the Vote and Emerge America, which recruits Democratic women to run for office.
Women's March's Carmona said she spends 60 hours a week on planning calls, including ""chapter"" calls with 30 to 45 local organizations. The group did a 10-state tour ahead of last year's congressional elections and is developing a nationwide strategy that would train more local leaders ahead of the 2020 presidential contest, she said.
There have been growing pains in a movement that grew out of hundreds of loosely affiliated marches in 2017.
In cities such as New York, there will be multiple events on Saturday hosted by different organizations, largely due to calls by some religious leaders to boycott Women's March over criticism that some of its leaders are anti-Semitic.
Women's March leader Linda Sarsour issued a statement condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and bigotry. Leaders Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland reiterated on ABC's talk show program ""The View"" this week that they were committed to a movement that fought all forms of oppression.
Leaders of Women's March and March On insist the divisions are not a weakness.
""I know there have been controversies this year and rifts and divides and those may or may not affect numbers on particular marches, but I haven't seen that have any effect on the movement's strength over all,"" Wruble said.

Carmona said ""there is a role for everyone"" no matter which group they join, adding decentralized movements had a kind of power that is ""hard to strike at.""

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 02:58PM ET</span>",Italy government approves flagship welfare reforms,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government on Thursday approved flagship reforms of the welfare and pension system, election pledges of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, which mark a major overhaul of the country's welfare state. 
The reforms, providing income support for the poor and allowing people to retire earlier, are the centre-piece of the government's expansionary 2019 budget. Critics say they are unsustainable for Italy's strained public finances.
""These are two measures...this government is proud of,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after the cabinet signed off on the legislation. ""This is a government that keeps its promises.""
It must now be approved by parliament within two months.
The need for an income support scheme, dubbed the ""citizens' income"" has been a 5-Star battle cry since its foundation a decade ago, and its determination has strengthened as poverty levels have grown to record highs in recent years.
""This reform will improve the quality of life for 5 million Italians in difficulty,"" said 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio. ""We have founded a new welfare state in Italy.""
Italians in absolute poverty, defined as not having enough money to buy a basket of basic goods and services, rose to 5.1 million in 2017, according to the latest data from statistics office ISTAT. That represents a more than three-fold increase in a decade.
The largest proportion live in southern regions which were the bedrock of 5-Star's support at last June's election, when it was Italy's largest party with some 32 percent of the vote.
However, public finance constraints forced the movement to drastically scale back its original blueprint of the citizens' income, which envisaged an outlay of 17 billion euros ($19.37 billion) in the first year.
The latest version will not take effect until April and will cost state coffers around 7 billion euros this year and 7.8 billion in 2020. It will provide means-tested income support of up to 780 euros per month for a single person living in rented accommodation with no other income.
A family of two adults and a child can receive up to 1,080 euros, while a family of two adults and three children can get up to 1,280 euros. Home-owners do not receive the standard rental contribution which is 280 euros. [L8N1Z851N]
LOWER RETIREMENT 
The pension reform, championed by the League, rolls back a 2011 law which had sharply raised the retirement age to 67 for many Italians, with further increases scheduled to match rising life expectancy.
Under the new rules, people will be able to retire when the sum of their age (62)and the years of their pension contributions (38) adds up to 100. [L8N1ZF5WD]
""I am very happy to have turned words into facts,"" said League chief Matteo Salvini, standing alongside Conte and Di Maio, adding he hoped to govern with them for the next 10 years.
The changes, which will take effect from April for private sector workers and August for state employees, will cost 4 billion euros this year and just over 8 billion in 2020.
The 2011 reform, passed at the height of a debt crisis, left hundreds of thousands of Italians who had quit work early expecting to retire shortly afterwards, stranded for years with neither a job nor a pension. 
The government says the new rules will end their plight while allowing older, less motivated workers to retire and free up jobs for the young unemployed.
Critics argue that in the long-term Italy's large public debt and ageing population mean it cannot afford to lower the retirement age.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>",U.S. separated 'thousands' more immigrant children than known: watchdog,"By Mica Rosenberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government may have separated ""thousands"" more immigrant children from their parents than previously known but inadequate record-keeping means the exact number is still unclear, an internal watchdog said on Thursday.
The Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said the agency had identified many more children in addition to the 2,737 included as part of a class action lawsuit challenging family separations brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) last year.
The administration of President Donald Trump implemented a 'zero tolerance' policy to criminally prosecute and jail all illegal border crossers even those traveling with their children, leading to a wave of separations last year. The policy sparked outrage when it became public, and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order reversing course on June 20, 2018.
But the auditor said in a report that prior to the officially announced 'zero tolerance' policy, the government began ramping up separations in 2017 for other reasons related to a child's safety and well-being, including separating parents with criminal records or lack of proper documents. 
The report also said more than 100 minors, including more than two dozen under five years old, were separated after the President's executive order. 
Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the practice of separating apprehended minors from adults to protect the interests of the children has been standard practice ""for more than a decade."" 
Reuters reported in June that from October 2016 through February 2018, before the official 'zero tolerance' policy was in place, nearly 1,800 immigrant families were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
These separations, though, were only tracked informally, making it impossible for the auditor to know the exact number overall.
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is run by HHS and is responsible for the care of immigrant children, initially recorded separated minors in an Excel spreadsheet and later a database program. ""However, use of these tools was not formalized in procedures, and access was limited,"" the auditor said. 
ORR said in an statement that the agency ""has only limited resources,"" and that counting prior DHS separations would take away from its main focus of caring for children in government custody. It said it has modified its case management process to interview children at intake and flag cases where there are signs of separation.
The government was ordered to reunite the more than 2,700 families covered by the ACLU lawsuit and report back about the progress of those reunifications regularly to a federal district court in California, including the status of around 400 parents that were deported without their children.
But little is known about the fate of the potentially thousands of children who were released but not covered by the class action, the auditor said. Legally the length of time immigrant children can be held in detention is limited and the government is charged with finding adequate sponsors or care for children who cross the border alone or are separated. 
""ORR was unable to provide a more precise estimate or specific information about these children's placements,"" for example if they were placed with relatives or in foster care. 
Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the ACLU case said in a statement: ""We will be back in court over this latest revelation.""
Congressional Democrats said they have already started investigating the issue and plan to hold oversight hearings.
SEPARATIONS CONTINUE
Separations have also continued since Trump's June executive order ending 'zero tolerance.' At least 118 children were separated between July 1 and Nov. 7, 2018, 82 of them were under the age of 13 and 27 of them under the age of 5, according to the report.
Of those, 65 were separated because the parents had a criminal history but in some cases the agency did not provide the details of that history. Other reasons cited included a parent's gang affiliation, illness or hospitalization or an adult claiming to be a legal guardian of a child without proof.
Anthony Enriquez, director of the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities in New York, said his agency is representing dozens of children who were separated from their parents after June last year.
He said there seems to be no standard for information sharing between the agencies, even months after the government was ordered to reunite many of the families by a court. 
""These children are constantly asking, 'Where is my parent?',"" he said.
The auditor raised concerns that the government is still not adequately counting separation cases. 

""It is not yet clear whether recent changes to ORR's systems and processes are sufficient to ensure consistent and accurate data about separated children,"" the report said.

Malaysia, a majority-Muslim country that does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, announced it would bar Israelis from any event in the Southeast Asia nation after banning Israeli athletes from the World Para Swimming championships this coming July.
In a statement, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon called on the International Paralympic Committee, which is organizing the competition, to change the venue if it cannot persuade Malaysia to lift the edict.
""This is shameful and totally opposes the Olympic spirit,"" the statement said. ""Israel condemns the decision, inspired no doubt by Malaysia PM Mahathir's rabid anti-Semitism.""
Mahathir, 93, has for decades been accused of anti-Semitism for his attacks against Jews. In a BBC interview in October, he described Jews as ""hook-nosed"" and blamed them for the troubles in the Middle East.
Swimmers from some 70 countries are expected to compete in the July 29-Aug. 4 championships in the eastern state of Sarawak. The event is an important milestone toward next year's Tokyo Paralympics.
The International Paralympic Committee said in a statement that it was ""bitterly disappointed at the stance of the Malaysian government"" and the IPC governing board would discuss the matter at a meeting in London next week.
Thousands in Malaysia and neighboring Indonesia took to the streets last December to protest against Washington's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a state they seek to establish. 
Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Wednesday that Malaysia would continue to take a strong position on the plight of the Palestinians. ""It is about fighting on behalf of the oppressed,"" he said.
Israeli athletes have been banned in the past by countries that do not recognize Israel. They have also competed at events in Arab countries without national symbols, typically under the flag of the sports federation running the event.

Last year, Israeli athletes participated in a Judo competition in Abu Dhabi under their own flag for the first time. Sports minister Miri Regev wept next to the podium as the Israeli anthem was played after an Israeli won a gold medal.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","Beset by protests, Serb leader stages lavish reception for Putin","By Maja Zuvela and Aleksandar Vasovic
BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia's pro-Western President Aleksandar Vucic staged a lavish welcome for Vladimir Putin on Thursday - even presenting the visiting Russian leader with a puppy - in what critics called a bid to deflect attention from weeks of anti-government protests.
Tens of thousands of people all over Serbia were bussed in to Belgrade to greet Putin in front of the Saint Sava Church in the evening. They waved Russian and Serbian flags and held banners reading ""Thank you President Putin"" in Serbian and in Russian. Russian songs were played on loudspeakers.
Serbia has been performing a delicate balancing act between its ambition to join its biggest trading partner the European Union, and its historical ties with Russia, which shares its Orthodox Christian faith and backed it diplomatically during a 1999 NATO bombing campaign.
Displaying his close relationship with Putin is particularly important for Vucic, a former ultranationalist who abruptly switched sides to become a leading advocate of closer relations with the EU but who still relies on rightwing support.
Vucic has faced weeks of protests against his rule by supporters of both the liberal and nationalist camps. Demonstrating his warm ties with Russia could help him counter accusations of selling out Serbia's interests to the West.
""It very important for us to have friends in the world and Putin and Russia are the most important,"" said Stefan, a 25-year old from the southern town of Novi Pazar who came to Belgrade for the event and declined to give his surname.
Putin promised to invest $1.4 billion in gas transport infrastructure in Serbia, which now buys all its natural gas from Russia via a pipeline over Ukraine, and hopes to be hooked up to the TurkStream gas pipeline being built from Russia to Turkey across the Black Sea.
""PUTIN GO AWAY""
Although today Russia is only Serbia's fifth largest trading partner, Serbs have looked to fellow Orthodox Christian Russia as a patron and ally throughout centuries of history in a Balkan region also home to Catholics and Muslims. 
Putin said Moscow will fully support Serbia in finding solutions for unresolved issues with its former province Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008.
Serbia withdrew its troops from Kosovo after the 1999 bombing campaign by NATO, which accused Belgrade of carrying out abuses during a campaign against ethnic Albanian insurgents. Belgrade has not recognized Kosovo's independence but has accepted the EU requirement that it normalize relations in practice with the former province in order to join the bloc.
During the visit Putin presented to Vucic Russia's Order of Alexander Nevsky, making him the only state leader outside of the former Soviet Union to received the medal. Vucic presented Putin a Yugoslavian Shepherd puppy named Pasha.
A big screen showing joint press conference was put up in the city's main square. Main streets were closed off as crowds headed toward the Saint Sava Church to meet Putin. A police officer said some 1,300 buses had arrived in Belgrade.
But some in Serbia see the Putin visit as a popularity stunt for Vucic to undermine the protests. In Vojvodina, north of Belgrade, posters with Putin pictures were put up overnight, reading ""Putin Go Away"" in English. 
Several civil society organizations also signed a letter protesting against the glorification of the Russian leader. 

""Accompanied by extensive media coverage, Putin’s visit further damages the already corroded democratic institutions, rights and freedoms of the citizens of Serbia,"" the letter said.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Explainer: How has Sweden come close to breaking its political deadlock?,"(Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven was ousted in late September when he lost a no-confidence vote in parliament after an inconclusive election, triggering a period of political deadlock that has lasted more than four months.
The country has had no government in place since then, and two candidates to lead new administrations have already been voted down by parliament.
On Friday it will vote on Lofven's candidacy after his Social Democrats struck a policy deal with the Centre and Liberal parties, and the Left Party said it would abstain, giving the former welder and union leader just enough backing to be elected.
Below are key points about the deadlock and its consequences.
WHAT SPARKED THE DEADLOCK?
The election results on Sept. 9 gave neither of the two political blocs in parliament the majority needed to form a government without the help of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.
WHAT ARE THOSE POLITICAL BLOCS?
There is a center-right Alliance consisting of the Moderates, the Christian Democrats, the Centre Party and the Liberals. There is also a center-left line-up consisting of the Social Democrats and the Greens, who have ruled in a coalition with the support of the Left Party. All mainstream parties have refused to work with the Sweden Democrats. 
WHY IS THERE NO GOVERNMENT YET? 
While the Moderates and Christian Democrats wanted to rule with tacit support from the Sweden Democrats, their Centre and Liberal parties Alliance partners refused to form a minority government reliant on the far-right party for getting legislation through parliament.
The Social Democrats, Greens and Left have 144 seats in the 349-member parliament, one more than the center-right Alliance.
The Sweden Democrats have 62 seats, giving them the balance of power between the two blocs.
In a first vote after the ousting of Lofven, the Centre Party and the Liberals voted down their own bloc's candidate, citing its need for support from the Sweden Democrats. 
WHY DO MAINSTREAM PARTIES RULE OUT COOPERATING WITH THE SWEDEN DEMOCRATS? 
The Sweden Democrats - with roots in the white supremacist fringe - want a voice on immigration, welfare and crime policies as the price for supporting a new government and have been threatening to block any new government unless they are given a say in policy.
WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES FOR PRIME MINISTER?
Lofven's main competitor for the premiership is Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson.
Centre Party leader Annie Loof was also at one point given the job of trying to break the deadlock by the speaker of parliament.
WHAT KIND OF DEAL WAS MADE BETWEEN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE TWO ALLIANCE PARTIES?
On Jan. 11, Social Democrats leader Lofven with support of the Greens made a deal with two opposition parties, the center-right Centre and Liberal parties. 
The agreement states that it will exclude the Sweden Democrats and the Left Party from influencing policy-making.
WHY DON'T THE CENTER PARTY AND THE LIBERALS WANT THE LEFT PARTY TO HAVE INFLUENCE? 
The Left Party was for a long time Sweden's Communist Party and has deep leftist roots. The Centre Party and the Liberals have said that any deal they make with the Social Democrats needs to exclude the Left Party. 
IS THE ALLIANCE STILL ALIVE?
The PM candidate for the Alliance, Ulf Kristersson, said after the deal between the Social Democrats, Centre and the Liberals on Jan. 11: ""This is a real betrayal of all the voters who voted for an Alliance party in order to get a new government and a new direction in Swedish politics.""
""If today's decision is carried out, they are breaking up the Alliance at a national level,"" he added.
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES?
In Friday's vote Stefan Lofven will most likely get the support needed to form a coalition with the Greens.
If parliament fails to elect him as prime minister, only one more attempt to form a government will be made before a snap election is held.
WHY DID THE LEFT PARTY SUPPORT LOFVEN?
The Left party is not officially supporting Lofven but will abstain from voting against him on Friday. Although they first refused to support a government that would exclude it from political influence, they later said they would not stop the government, after talks with Lofven.
However, they warned that if Lofven's government swings too far to the right they will try to pull the plug on him, suggesting he may struggle to deliver on an agenda that includes tax cuts and labor market reform.
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM A SNAP ELECTION?
Recent polls from local Swedish polling companies show there has been no big change in public opinion trends since the election, with the Sweden Democrats polling at their average before the election, making it likely a new parliamentary election would not help resolve the situation.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Hundreds gather in Polish city of Gdansk at murdered mayor's coffin,"By Pawel Goraj
GDANSK, Poland (Reuters) - Hundreds gathered at the coffin of murdered liberal mayor Pawel Adamowicz in the port city of Gdansk on Thursday as it lay in state in the museum of the Solidarity movement that helped bring down communism in Poland.
Adamowicz's coffin was draped in Gdansk's scarlet coat of arms as about 2,500 people, according to police, queued after dark amid freezing wind to pay their respects. Candles placed in the shape of a giant heart stood in front of the museum.
Adamowicz, a critic of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and its anti-immigrant policies, was stabbed on Sunday evening by a man who rushed the stage during a charity event. He died the following day.
Police detained at least 10 people in recent days over calls on social media to murder and acts of aggression made in the wake of Adamowicz's death. 
The incidents reflect the charged political atmosphere in a number of European countries, including Poland and Hungary, where populist leaders have fanned nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.
Critics have said Poland's politicians have been cranking up hate speech and aggression in public life, and blamed the ruling PiS party for not reacting earlier.
Adamowicz was one of 11 Polish mayors who were the target of fake death certificates by a far-right group called All-Polish Youth in 2017 after they signed a declaration to welcome refugees against the government's anti-migration policies.
The prosecutor's office decided not to pursue the case further at the time. 
Support for PiS fell to 30 percent in the wake of Adamowicz's death, according to a poll conducted by Kantar Millward Brown for Gazeta Wyborcza daily, from 33 percent in November, while the biggest opposition grouping Koalicja Obywatelska has 25 percent.
Thousands of people gathered in vigils earlier this week in Polish cities to mourn the death of Adamowicz, who had been mayor of Gdansk for 20 years and espoused liberal causes at odds with the conservative nationalist government.

Polish authorities have arrested a 27-year-old former convict named Stefan W. in connection with the murder. His full name has so far been withheld.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",Hungarian Jews split about Danube search for Holocaust victims,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's largest Jewish organization on Thursday asked Israeli and Hungarian authorities to suspend a search for the remains of Holocaust victims in the Danube riverbed, saying the dead should be left in peace.
At the request of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, an Israeli team this week began mapping out the floor of the Danube in Budapest in search of the remains of Holocaust victims murdered on the riverbank by Hungarian fascists in 1944 and 1945.
""Disturbing the resting place of the dead is a complex and sensitive matter,"" the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities, or Mazsihisz, said on its website.
""Bones have probably scattered in the 75 years and could have been washed as far downstream as the Black Sea ... searching for them is needless, and breaches the peace and dignity of the dead, Jewish or Goyim. It breaches the Halacha (Jewish religious law).""
More than half a million Hungarian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, including thousands shot on the riverbank by the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross party, which briefly ruled Hungary toward the end of World War Two.
In 2016, after some Jewish remains were uncovered from the riverbed during the renovation of a Budapest bridge, the victims were honoured in a symbolic burial by all Jewish congregations. Mazsihisz says that was sufficient.
But Orthodox and Hasidic Jews asked the Israeli volunteer group ZAKA to look for more remains. ZAKA plans to return to Budapest with divers in February. 
ZAKA's project leader, Ilan Berkovich, said the project would go on unless the Orthodox and Hasidic communities said otherwise.
""I guess (the Mazsihisz complaint) has more to do with the internal politics of those groups; we try not to be involved.""
The Hasidic Unified Hungarian Israelite Congregation (EMIH), which plans to transfer the remains to Israel, said this week that it was ""righteous"" to transfer the dead to a new grave if the previous one had been flooded.
A spokesman said EMIH considered it a moral obligation to give a full burial to any remains still in the river.

It is not the first issue to split Hungary's strong and vibrant community of about 100,000 Jews: a planned new Holocaust museum in Budapest, which EMIH owns but Mazsihisz and others criticized, was also a bone of contention.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",Communist Cuba seeks improved governance,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba is on the verge of the most dramatic restructuring of its government in decades as popular criticism and frustration with a sluggish economy and bureaucracy mount.
If a revamped constitution is passed next month, as reports in the state-controlled media have suggested, new executive positions, from a prime minister to provincial governors and municipal mayors, will be created to lighten the load on single figureheads, such as the president, and increase the focus on executing policy.
Provincial government will be reduced under the proposals in a land the size of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and municipal government strengthened.
“The structural changes in government proposed in the constitution all seem aimed at improving efficiency,” said William LeoGrande, a professor of government at American University.
“For example, the new post of prime minister puts someone in charge of the day-to-day job of overseeing the ministries,” he said.
The proposals dovetail with ongoing economic reforms of the Soviet-style system. They imply stronger governance, such as making state companies more autonomous and implementation of a tax system after more than a half a century of no direct taxes.
The terms of ward delegates, the only directly elected leaders in the country, will double to five years and the leaders of municipal assemblies and mayors will make up provincial councils led by the governor, replacing provincial assemblies.
The ward-level delegates already make up the municipal assemblies and elect their local executives. They will now also ratify the governors proposed by the president and who will coordinate between the national and municipal levels.
Bert Hoffman, a Latin America expert at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies, said Cuba’s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel “wants to show that he is a modernizer and second, someone who achieves change.”
Like LeoGrande, Hoffman said economic reforms were moving slowly because there appeared to be resistance and a lack of consensus among the Communist-ruled island's leadership under Diaz-Canel.
“So he takes on the institutional setup which does not immediately affect powerful interests and where he can make progress. It will also allow him to bring in new cadres and consolidate his power base,” Hoffman said.
Campaigning is prohibited in Cuba, and candidates for the ward posts are nominated at neighborhood meetings. They need not belong to the Communist Party, and many candidates are independents, but only a few government opponents have ever competed. In 2017 they were barred from doing so.
The candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are not directly elected. Commissions composed of representatives of Communist Party-controlled organizations, such as the trade union federation, present them as a slate for a public vote. They in turn elect the executive.
Assuming the new constitution is passed, only the 605-member National Assembly will take office through this indirect method in the future.
During a grassroots debate on the constitution, before the final version was drafted, issues such as gay marriage and social equality dominated discussion, according to the government, while thousands of citizens raised various concerns over the electoral system.
Meanwhile, while state-run media are pushing for a ""yes"" vote, debate on whether to vote for or against the revamped constitution is raging among a smaller percentage of the population with access to the internet.

“I will vote no because Article 5 of the Constitution leaves the country in the hands of the Communist Party for centuries to come,” tweeted Yoani Sanchez, the island’s most famous blogger and editor of an online newspaper.

Earlier, a spokeswoman for May told reporters that a one-page document had been shown to lawmakers during meetings aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit.

May has been meeting lawmakers from all parties on Thursday in an attempt to find a way out of an impasse over how Britain should leave the EU, after May's own plan was resoundingly rejected by parliament on Tuesday.
Although May has repeatedly rejected a second referendum, a vocal campaign in favor of holding a new vote has the support of some lawmakers.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Global powers have become so diverted by populism and domestic discontent that they lack the capacity or inclination to defend human rights or even investigate suspected war crimes, global pressure group Human Rights Watch said on Thursday.
The United States and the largest countries of the European Union, which since the days of the Cold War have used human rights rhetoric as a core foreign policy tool, were no longer so reliable as partners, the group's head, Kenneth Roth, said.
Launching its annual survey of the human rights situation around the world, Roth said the task of standing up to oppression was increasingly falling to domestic pressure groups.
""Trump was too busy embracing the autocrats whom he sees as friendly,"" Roth said in an interview before the report's launch. ""Britain was completely preoccupied by Brexit. French President (Emmanuel) Macron talks a good game but really didn't implement.
""Even in Germany, where Chancellor (Angela) Merkel has been a real hero, she has also been beleaguered by a far-right challenge.""
France, Britain and the U.S. had not engaged with HRW when it had approached them with proposals for a human rights investigation of war crimes committed in Yemen, where Saudi-backed forces are waging a bloody war, Roth said.
The U.S. had been ""nowhere to be seen"" on the matter while a Brexit-burdened Foreign Office had ""no bandwidth"" for anything else, he said.
In the end, the investigation took place, pushed by a loose coalition of countries led by the Netherlands, he said.
The British, French and U.S. governments did not immediately respond when asked about Roth's comments.
The emergence of ad hoc coalitions of countries and domestic activists groups delivering a strong ""human rights pushback"" was a key theme of the group's 674-page World Report, launched in Berlin on Thursday.
Roth pointed to street campaigns against attacks on democracy in Europe and efforts to prevent massacres in Syria and to bring to justice perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar as examples of successes notched up in this way.
The 57 countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), traditionally silent on human rights issues other than in Israel, had also emerged as an ally, speaking up for their Rohingya co-religionists facing persecution in Myanmar.
But it remained to be seen if the OIC would raise its voice for the million Uighur Muslims being detained in so-called re-education centers in China, a situation Roth said was the world's most overlooked human rights crisis.

""Can they take the next step and defend another huge group of Muslims facing persecution when it's not a tiny little government like Myanmar that's persecuting them but great big China?"" he asked.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo traded barbs with election rival Prabowo Subianto over issues including corruption and law enforcement in a first debate on Thursday three months ahead of voting in the world's third-biggest democracy.
The contest to lead what is also the largest Muslim-majority nation is a repeat of the 2014 race when Widodo, 57, narrowly beat the retired general to become the first president from outside Indonesia's political and military elite.
Halfway into the campaign, most opinion polls give Widodo a healthy double-digit lead over Prabowo, as he is known locally.
But with up to a quarter of voters still undecided, pollsters expect the gap to narrow.
Candidates and their running mates for the April 17 election were questioned over human rights, corruption and terrorism im the world's fourth most populous country.
Widodo said his team ""offers optimism"", while Prabowo, 67, highlighted poverty and income inequality holding back much of the country's more than 250 million people.
Dressed in a white shirt, Widodo at times appeared agitated while defending his record, as his rival repeatedly questioned the country's legal system and endemic corruption.
His running mate, Ma'ruf Amin, a 75-year old Muslim cleric, remained conspicuously quiet for much of the two-hour debate, spawning jokes among social media users. Amin, who was brought in to shore up the president's Islamic credentials, was a controversial pick for Widodo's more moderate supporters because of his conservative stance on minority groups and rights issues.
Prabowo and his running mate, businessman Sandiaga Uno - both dressed in black suits and red ties - said they would take ""drastic"" action against graft convicts, suggesting they could be isolated on a deserted island and given hard labor. 
In 2017, Indonesia ranked 90 out of 176 countries in Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index, on a par with countries such as Liberia and Colombia.
Prabowo has attacked Widodo's management of Southeast Asia's biggest economy, zeroing in on flat growth and income inequality, and promising to boost job creation and investment.
Rights activist Andreas Harsono said neither ticket gave a comprehensive response to tackling abuses or the persecution of minorities like the LGBT community or the Islamic Ahmadiyah sect.
Prabowo, a former special forces commander, has been accused of abuses, in particular of kidnapping and torturing student activists during the social unrest in 1998 that brought down former authoritarian leader Suharto.

His campaign team has denied that, saying Prabowo did not mastermind the kidnappings but was acting with a team of soldiers on superiors' orders.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Gunmen in Ghana have shot dead an investigative journalist who helped uncover corruption in soccer, rights groups and his employer said on Thursday. 
Ahmed Hussein-Suale was shot three times by men on a motorbike while driving home from work on Wednesday in the capital Accra, said his production company Tiger Eye PI.
""We ... are terribly devastated by this dastardly act, but remain unshaken in our resolve to make ... corruption a high-risk activity in this country,"" it said in a statement.
Hussein-Suale was part of a team led by well-known undercover journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas. Their crew is famous for a documentary last year that accused 77 referees and Ghana's then soccer chief Kwesi Nyantakyi of taking bribes.
The film prompted Ghana to dissolve its Football Association. Nyantakyi was suspended by world soccer's governing body FIFA and stepped down shortly after, apologizing for what he called his ""indiscretion"".
The killing came as a shock in Ghana, whose vibrant press enjoys relative freedom compared to many African nations. 
""I expect the police to bring to book, as soon as possible, the perpetrators of this heinous crime,"" said President Afuko-Addo on Twitter. 
Ghana's police and government officials were not immediately available for further comment. 
Ghana is ranked 23rd out of 180 countries in a world press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which is Africa's highest ranking.
But the killing came after a campaign of abuse against the documentary team. After its airing, government legislator Kennedy Agyapong called Hussein-Suale ""dangerous"", shared photos of him and told viewers he would pay for them to ""beat him"". 
He was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
Anas, who covers his face in public for safety reasons, posted about the death on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter feed.
""Sad news, but we shall not be silenced,"" he said. 

""Rest in peace, Ahmed.""

The proposed rule to force people suspected of benefiting from suspicious financial transactions to prove that their wealth came from legitimate sources was rejected by a parliamentary committee on Thursday because it was not specific enough.
Estonia has been under the regulatory spotlight after Danske Bank said last year that payments totaling 200 billion euros ($228 billion), many of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Estonia still plans other new measures to combat money laundering, including increasing maximum penalties on financial institutions and giving more powers to the Financial Intelligence Unit. 
However, the rule on disclosure of personal wealth had been strongly criticized by the Chancellor of Justice, the country's legal ombudsman, as working against the basic legal principle of innocent until proven guilty.
""The current wording is not specific enough and of course, we do not want to create anxiety for honest people,"" Jaanus Karilaid, the head of parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, said in a statement after the committee removed the plan from the proposed legislation.
Karilaid said a re-worked version of the rule could still be included in the legislation after the first reading in parliament, which is due next week. Some independent lawyers, who did not wish to be identified, said they doubted it would be revived.
Under current law, it is up to prosecutors to show that a suspect's wealth was illegally obtained, but the proposal would have put the burden of proof on the suspect.

In December Estonia arrested 10 former employees of the local branch of Danske Bank as part of an international investigation into the alleged money laundering.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Reluctant Labour leader still coy on prospect of new Brexit referendum,"By Elizabeth Piper
HASTINGS, England (Reuters) - It doesn't take much for Britain's main opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to win a cheer from his Labour Party faithful -- the ovations the left-wing leader gets for his promises to build a fairer society have become the stuff of political lore.
But in the English seaside town of Hastings on Thursday, another message drew an almighty roar of approval -- that his party might look at a second referendum on Brexit.
The prospect of holding a second referendum on leaving the European Union poses a particular challenge for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back it, others just want to leave as soon as possible.
Like the rest of Britain, Labour was deeply divided by the June 2016 referendum on membership of the EU in which 52 percent voted to leave and 48 percent backed remaining in the bloc. 
Sources in Labour suggest that a second referendum -- backers call it a ""People's Vote"" -- is something Corbyn would do almost anything to avoid. So far, he has kept the option open while being clear that he would prefer other alternatives, such as a new election or Labour's own plan for leaving the EU.
""All options are on the table. We're serious about finding a way through,"" he told several hundred supporters in a meeting hall in a former church on the southern English seafront. 
""Our first option is the alternative plan we have laid out over the past year ... But if the government remains intransigent ... and the country is facing the potential disaster of 'no deal', our duty will then be to look at other options ... including the option of a public vote.""
That drew cheers from a crowd which also applauded Corbyn's plan not to speak to May to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament on Brexit unless the prime minister rules out leaving the EU without an agreement -- the 'no deal' option.
May has adamantly rejected any new vote that would allow an option to halt Brexit. The prime minister says a failure to deliver the outcome of the 2016 vote to leave would be ""catastrophic"" for British democracy.
Nevertheless, backers of a new referendum say it would be possible to force one, if Corbyn were finally willing to throw the support of the main opposition party behind it.
Although Corbyn campaigned to remain in the EU in 2016, some of his critics within the party say he was only ever a lukewarm supporter of it. He voted against joining the European project in the 1970s and criticized it from the left for decades.
Labour sources say Corbyn's reluctance to support a second referendum comes from a fear not only of alienating Labour voters mainly in northern and central England who backed ""leave"", but also concern about widening rifts in the country.
""SPLINTERS""
In a week when May's plan for Brexit was crushed in parliament and Corbyn's bid to force a national election failed, many in the party say the time to put off a decision has now run out. David Lammy, a prominent Labour supporter of a new referendum, said that if Corbyn sits on the fence, he ""will get splinters in places he doesn't want"".
Three of Britain's four living former prime ministers say a People's Vote is the only way to break the deadlock. A poll this week found Britain would back staying in the EU by a 12 percentage point margin.
But for Labour's leadership, the idea of a second referendum poses serious problems -- it could alienate ""leave"" voters in the next election, who form a majority in many of the constituencies Labour would need to win to take power.
Only 71 of the 256 Labour lawmakers signed a letter to Corbyn this week calling on him to back a new vote, and J.P. Morgan analyst Malcolm Burr noted that even if Corbyn ordered his party to back it, some of his lawmakers would still balk. 
""We find it difficult to see Labour support for a second referendum rising above 200 votes,"" Burr said, noting that this would mean 65 Conservatives would have to be won over. He put the odds of a new referendum at just 25 percent.
Still there is continued pressure, from other opposition parties and from business. In a letter on Wednesday after the Conservative government defeated Corbyn's no-confidence motion which could have triggered an election, leaders of the smaller opposition parties wrote to ask Corbyn to back a new referendum.
""Following this evening's unsuccessful vote of no confidence in the prime minister, which we all supported, we are writing to implore you to adopt as party policy a People's Vote on the final Brexit deal,"" wrote parliamentary leaders of Scottish and Welsh parties, the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and the Greens.
More than 100 bosses of smaller British companies including in media, design and architecture also said the only way to stop the country from ""crashing out of the EU with no deal"" would be to ask ""the people whether they still want to leave the EU"".
""With the clock now ticking rapidly before we are due to quit, politicians must not waste any more time on fantasies,"" they wrote in a letter.
But for now, Corbyn is still in no hurry to pick sides.
""We are the party that has consistently sought to bring people together, to find a way through that respects people's concerns whichever way they voted in the referendum,"" he said.

""Because I believe that the real divide in our country is not between leave and remain,"" he said, shifting to a Labour Party slogan: ""It is between the many and the few.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors said on Thursday they were temporarily suspending an investigation into suspicious payments handled by the former driver of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son, Flavio, due to a Supreme Court ruling.
The Supreme Court ruling injunction was sealed, the prosecutors said in a written statement, and no details were immediately available about who had lodged it, or why. 
Questions over the origin of funds in the bank account of Fabricio Queiroz, who for years was a driver on the payroll of former Rio state lawmaker and Senator-elect Flavio Bolsonaro, have threatened to tarnish the reputation of the Bolsonaro family, whose members surged to power on a promise to end years of political corruption.
The scandal arose after Brazil's Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF) identified 1.2 million reais ($305,000) that in 2016-17 flowed through the bank account of Queiroz. Some payments were made to the president's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro.
Flavio Bolsonaro, his father and Queiroz have all said they are innocent of any crime.
Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors had asked Flavio Bolsonaro to meet with them to explain the irregular cash flows on Thursday, after Queiroz failed to show up for previous appointments, citing health reasons. 
But Flavio Bolsonaro said he would not meet with prosecutors as planned, saying he had only been notified of the appointment on Monday. He vowed to arrange a new time.
""As I am not being investigated, I have not yet had access to the records,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""I hereby undertake to schedule a day and time to present the duly substantiated explanations...so that there is no doubt about my conduct.""
Jair Bolsonaro, who took power on Jan. 1, has said the payment to his wife was Queiroz repaying a personal loan. 
Flavio Bolsonaro has said that Queiroz gave him a ""plausible"" explanation, and that the accusations were intended to destabilize the Bolsonaro family.
In a TV interview late last month, Queiroz said the money in his account was from a side-business of buying and selling cars.
""I'm a businessman,"" he said. ""I make money.""
According to COAF, some of the payments to Queiroz' bank account were made by other employees on Flavio Bolsonaro's payroll when he served as a state lawmaker, including by Queiroz's own daughter. Many of the deposits were made on or around the same day the employees were paid, COAF found.

Demonstrations also erupted in three other cities as part of a four-week long unrest that poses the most persistent challenge to Bashir's grip since he took power in a coup in 1989.
Sudanese security forces fired tear gas to scatter hundreds of protesters, some throwing stones, in Khartoum's Burri neighborhood, a Reuters witness said.
""We will continue to protest until the government falls because we want to provide a better life for our children,"" a 47-year-old teacher among the demonstrators said. 
Hundreds also protested in al-Qadarif, Atbara and Al-Ubayyid, drawing tear gas volleys from police, witnesses said. 
Protests have rippled across Sudan since Dec. 19 and security forces have at times used live ammunition to disperse demonstrations. The official death toll stands at 24, including two security forces personnel. Amnesty International has said that more than 40 people have been killed.
Sudan’s economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - since South Sudan seceded in 2011, keeping most of the oilfields.
The United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions on Sudan in 2017. But many investors continue to shun a country still listed by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges, which he denies, of masterminding genocide in the Darfur region.

LISBON (Reuters) - Britons living in Portugal will keep their residency rights and tourists won't need a visa even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and Lisbon hopes Britain would offer the same benefits to Portuguese citizens, Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira said.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but Parliament's rejection this week of Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels has thrown those plans into chaos and opened up a range of outcomes, from quitting with no agreement on future relations to halting Brexit altogether.
""At this moment we do not even know what the United Kingdom wants,"" Siza Vieira told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday. 
""In the absence of an alternative proposal by the United Kingdom what every (EU) member state is doing is adopting measures that allow them to react to a unilateral circumstance.""
Even without a Brexit deal, British citizens living in Portugal would retain rights including access to healthcare. ""We are ready to do this unilaterally,"" he said, adding that he hopes Britain will do the same for Portuguese. 
Britons are the biggest group of tourists to Portugal but their numbers have dipped recently as the pound has fallen against the euro on Brexit concerns. Portugal will launch a promotional campaign in Britain in an attempt to offset this, the minister said.
Portugal and Britain are the world's oldest allies, forged through a 1386 treaty.
A tourist boom has boosted Portugal's economy after its 2010-14 debt crisis and the minister predicted tourist numbers would continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace.
""We ... assume that tourism will continue to grow, though probably not at the same rate as in recent years -- Portugal was one of the tourist destinations that grew the most in recent years,"" Siza Vieira said.
A record 13 million tourists arrived last year. 
Siza Vieira said he expected further expansion in investment, a motor for growth in recent years, including attracting companies from third countries which might previously have considered Britain as an EU center.
""We are seeing growth in investment with European origin, but also American and from various parts of Asia,"" he said.

Opposition leader and election runner-up Martin Fayulu is demanding that Congo's highest court order a recount of the Dec. 30 vote, which was meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence. 
Fayulu claims he won by a landslide and that the victory of another opposition figure, Felix Tshisekedi, was engineered by authorities. The dispute risks stoking new instability in the volatile Central African country where previous elections have been followed by violence. 
Election officials deny the results were rigged. 
The original statement on Sunday by SADC, which includes Kinshasa allies like South Africa and Angola, and another regional body the following day had piled pressure on Congo to address the allegations.
But apparently wary that a recount could heighten tensions, South Africa and Zambia backtracked within 24 hours of Sunday's statement and said they would not push for one.
On Thursday, the entire 16-member bloc echoed that position following an emergency meeting in Addis Ababa attended by heads of state including South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa and Angola's Joao Lourenco. 
""We call upon the international community to respect...the ongoing internal legal and political processes for the finalization of the electoral process,"" SADC said in a statement. It made no mention of an earlier appeal for a power-sharing government. 
The African Union was also holding a meeting on Thursday in Addis, which AU chairperson and Rwandan President Paul Kagame said was aimed at preventing ""the people outside of our continent to meddle...trying to find solutions for us"". 
Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager, says Tshisekedi, who is the president of Congo's largest opposition party, struck a deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila to be declared winner. Tshisekedi and Kabila's camps deny that. 
The Constitutional Court is due to rule by Friday on Fayulu's complaint, but Fayulu has said he is not confident he will win before the nine-judge court, which he considers friendly to Kabila. 
The United States on Wednesday kept up the pressure on Kinshasa, vowing to ""hold accountable"" anyone who undermines democratic processes. 

Domestic election monitors noted a range of voting irregularities, and the Catholic Church said official results are inconsistent with its own tallies. Three diplomats briefed on the Church's findings said they show that Fayulu won a clear victory.

A Yemeni source in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen told Reuters that Cammaert's convoy had come under fire while visiting an area under coalition control and accused the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement of opening fire.
""Patrick Cammaert and team are safe in Hodeidah following reported shooting incident. More information to come later,"" the office of the spokesperson for the U.N. chief tweeted.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>","Italy's Berlusconi seeks ballot-box glory again, this time in Europe","By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Thursday he will run in May's European parliamentary election, standing as a candidate for public office for the first time since being found guilty of tax fraud in 2013.
Berlusconi, 82, a flamboyant media mogul and scandal-prone center-right politician, was expelled from the upper house Senate and barred from office after his graft conviction. 
However, the ban was lifted in May last year, allowing him to return to the electoral fray.
""At my ripe old age, I have decided out of a sense of responsibility to go to Europe, which lacks a deep world vision,"" the perennially tanned Berlusconi told supporters on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.
Having his name on the top of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) party's EU ticket will boost its visibility and almost certainly ensure his election. But there is no guarantee that once he has won a seat, he will spend much, if any time in Brussels.
Italian leaders often put themselves forward in European votes only to then focus on domestic politics after the ballot.
One of Berlusconi's biggest political controversies kicked off in the European parliament in 2003, when, in his capacity as prime minister, he compared a German lawmaker to a Nazi concentration camp guard.
Berlusconi said he wanted to stand in order to fight the 5-Star Movement, which has formed a coalition government with the billionaire businessman's traditional ally, the League.
""We need to change this government, which includes the 5-Star Movement that is led by people who have no experience and are incompetent,"" he said.
""The alliance (with the League) is not natural and I do not think it will last long,"" he added.
Berlusconi campaigned for Forza in last March's national election but said his inability to stand as a candidate hurt its chances and for the first time the group trailed the League, by 14 percent of the vote to 17.35 percent.
The center-right bloc emerged as overall winners last March, but fell short of an outright parliamentary majority, opening the way for the League to split from its old allies and enter into a coalition with its former foe, the 5-Star.
Since then, Forza Italia has slid further, with most recent surveys putting it on 8.2 percent against 32.2 percent for the League, which is headed by Matteo Salvini and has jumped above 5-Star to become Italy's most popular party.
Berlusconi has been prime minister four times in a political career beset by corruption and sex scandals.

He says he is the victim of leftist magistrates and has constantly defied his many enemies to overcome legal and health setbacks and return to frontline politics.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>","Factbox: UK PM May's Brexit next steps - Nothing has changed, or new approach?","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a collaborative approach to finding a new Brexit deal after the agreement she had negotiated was crushed by parliament on Tuesday in the biggest defeat for a British government in modern times.
What is her new approach, and will it work?
WHAT IS MAY PROPOSING?
Immediately after Tuesday's 432 to 202 defeat, May said she would meet with senior parliamentarians from all parties to seek a deal that could command the support of parliament and was ""genuinely negotiable"". She said there was an urgent need to make progress.
She has sought meetings with the leaders of all other opposition parties in parliament and committed to make a statement on her new approach on Jan. 21. 
WILL IT WORK?
May is largely keeping to the negotiating principles she has used throughout the Brexit talks, which have alienated different factions of lawmakers on different points. 
There is no single policy change May can make that both respects her negotiating principles and can win over enough lawmakers to get parliamentary approval. 
Any change she makes to appeal to one group will probably cost her votes from another faction.
WHAT IS UP FOR DISCUSSION?
May has set out the terms on which she is willing to talk. She refers to them as principles for the discussion, others call them ""red lines"". These are the key issues:
- 1. NO-DEAL BREXIT 
May's preference is to leave the EU with a deal, but she does not rule out leaving without a deal.
If May said she wanted to leave without a deal she would gain the support of some Conservative euroskeptics, but lose the support of pro-EU lawmakers in her party and rule out winning votes from almost all opposition parties. 
If she ruled out leaving without a deal, she would open up the possibility of gaining votes from the opposition Labour party and pro-EU Conservative lawmakers, but would alienate Conservative Brexit supporters who say the threat of such a departure is a crucial bargaining chip in talks with the EU.
- 2. DELAY BREXIT
May wants Britain to leave on March 29, the date set down in British law.
If she chose to try to delay that date she would lose the support of Conservative euroskeptics, but open up the possibility of winning votes from other parties. However, on its own, this would not be enough to win opponents' support. 
- 3. THE BACKSTOP
May has agreed to an insurance policy designed to prevent the return of border posts and checks on the frontier between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland, and so ensure respect for a pact that has secured more than 20 years of inter-communal peace in the once-troubled British province. 
This has cost her the votes of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority government, and a large cohort of euroskeptic lawmakers in her own party.
If she successfully removed or altered the so-called 'backstop' she could win the support of many critics in her own party and bring the DUP on board. 
But the European Union, defending Ireland's interests, has insisted there cannot be a deal without the backstop.
- 4. END FREE MOVEMENT
May says any deal must give Britain control of its borders, laws, and money. This refers to an ambition to end free movement of people from the EU, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and stop making membership payments to the EU.
By dropping the requirement to end free movement, May would open up the possibility of a 'softer' Brexit that involves remaining a member of the EU single market, for instance one modeled on Norway's relationship with the EU.
This could win the support of pro-EU lawmakers in her own party, and could help to win over some opposition members of parliament. But it would cost her the votes of Conservative euroskeptics, who argue it would not be a ""true Brexit"".
- 5. INDEPENDENT TRADE POLICY
May insists that Britain must be free to strike free trade deals with other countries. This effectively rules out Britain remaining in the EU customs union, or setting up a new permanent customs union with the EU.

Changing this policy would meet one of the main demands of the opposition Labour Party, but would cost May the votes of Conservative euroskeptics and some others who say it would tie Britain into a set of rules that it had little power to influence.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia pumps money into restive Shi'ite quarter it once flattened,"By Stephen Kalin
AWAMIYA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - The old quarter of Awamiya, a town on Saudi Arabia's oil-producing eastern shore that was once the center of Shi'ite protests, was leveled in 2017 following a security campaign against gunmen the authorities accuse of having links to Iran.
The district's maze of mud brick homes and narrow alleyways, which militants used for years to launch surprise attacks against police, have now been replaced by a shopping complex, events hall and expansive plazas dotted with palm trees.
The Riyadh government, supportive of a puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that considers Shi'ite Muslims heretics, hopes investing in the broader area of Qatif after decades of alleged neglect will finally snuff out the violence.
These efforts are a test for the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has struck a conciliatory tone toward the kingdom's Shi'ite minority while confronting arch-rival Iran in a decades-long struggle for influence across the Middle East.
Shi'ites have long complained of discrimination they say keeps them from senior government jobs, reduces state investment in their areas and leads to closures of centers of worship.
Security forces have repeatedly quashed mass protests in Qatif, starting with a 1979 uprising inspired by the Iranian revolution of the same year. At the time, another district in Awamiya was destroyed and turned into a parking lot.
In 2011, Arab Spring uprisings in other Arab countries sparked more fighting, drawing Qatif deeper into Saudi Arabia's regional contest with Iran and ultimately leading to the demolition of a district in Awamiya known as al-Musawara.
The government has spent more than $60 million to rebuild the 18-hectare (45-acre) al-Musawara and another $230 million to compensate residents for hundreds of razed homes. More money is being pumped in to rehabilitate schools, hospitals and malls as well as beaches, a fish market, and an old fort.
REGIONAL RIVALRY
Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, won Western plaudits for social and economic reforms that include committing the country to a more moderate form of Islam than the semi-official Wahhabi school, which has often been criticized as the ideology of radical Islamists worldwide.
But the reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent and a purge of top princes and businessmen on corruption charges. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate last October has further raised doubts about whether MbS is serious about real change.
Following decades of repression, any attempt to improve sectarian relations will take time. And it is likely to face suspicion from Shi'ites, say Western diplomats and analysts.
""If the government is going after people like Khashoggi and the business elite in that harsh way, then just imagine how they would go after some Shia who makes trouble,"" said Toby Matthiesen, a research fellow of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge.
Since becoming defense minister in 2015, the crown prince has taken a more assertive stance against Tehran, launching a war against Yemen's Iranian-aligned Houthis and cutting ties with Qatar in part over accusations it is cozying up to Iran.
He has tried to distance that from domestic unrest, telling an American magazine last year that Riyadh's problem was with the ideology of the Iranian regime, not Shi'ites. But critics say the government's heavy-handed tactics have not changed. 
Five human rights activists from Qatif, including a woman, are facing the death penalty in a trial condemned by rights groups and the United Nations.
""FRUSTRATION AND FATIGUE""
A military vehicle sitting at the edge of al-Musawara, now rebranded Wasat (Central) Awamiya, is a reminder of street battles that left buildings pockmarked with bullet holes.
A day before Reuters visited the quarter on a government media tour last week, six people were killed in a security operation in another part of Qatif, raising concerns that militants quashed in one area will pop up in others.
Fahad Jubeir, mayor of Eastern Province, said he is confident that residents will embrace the government initiative.
""I expect it will have the magical effect of changing the area from a shelter for terrorists into a beacon of civilization,"" Jubeir said, voicing hope that all traces of violence would disappear ""very soon"".
A project manager said designers consulted with locals to faithfully replicate historical architecture amid concerns over the demolition of centuries-old buildings in a region where heritage is rarely preserved.
Gone are the covered passageways too tight for vehicles to pass, replaced by more than 5.5 hectares of green spaces.
Matthiesen, the scholar who has written a book about sectarianism in the Gulf, said even if residents are unsatisfied they are unlikely to resist amid growing repression.

""That doesn't mean that it's somehow going well or that it's a new approach to the Shi'a. There's just a general sense of frustration and fatigue,"" he said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties hope to deliver final lists of prisoners to the United Nations after talks in Amman on Thursday under an exchange agreement, a government delegate said.
The United Nations is pushing for the swap and a peace deal in the main port city of Hodeidah to pave the way for a second round of talks to end the nearly four-year war that has killed tens of thousands of people.
While there is progress on the prisoners, the United Nations has struggled to implement a troop withdrawal from Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions, amid mistrust among all sides.
The Iranian-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government on Dec. 11 exchanged lists of around 15,000 prisoners. They must submit written remarks on lists provided by the other side, respond and sign the final versions before handing them to the United Nations and the Red Cross which would oversee the exchange.
""We are at the stage of remarks but there are some gaps that are now being addressed,"" the head of the government delegation, Hadi Haig, told Reuters.
Muin Shreim, deputy to the U.N. special envoy to Yemen, said the technical meeting had a ""positive atmosphere"".
The swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at last month's U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, held amid Western pressure to end the conflict that has left 15.9 million people facing severe hunger.
The war pits the Houthis against Yemeni forces backed by the Sunni Muslim coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa in 2014.
Hodeidah, currently held by the Houthis with thousands of coalition forces massed on the outskirts, became the focus of the war last year, raising fears that a full-scale assault could cut off supply lines and lead to mass starvation.
The U.N. Security Council approved on Wednesday the deployment of up to 75 observers to the Red Sea city -- the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and aid -- to monitor a truce and troop withdrawal by both sides.
The ceasefire has held but the troop withdrawal has stalled over differences on who would control Hodeidah. Frontlines have not shifted and the main road from the port to Sanaa remains blocked, hampering distribution of goods to northern Yemen.
The conflict is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say their revolution is against corruption.

Since Bongo fell ill in Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24, contradictory information on the state of his health and an extended convalescence in Morocco has fueled instability back in Gabon, where his family has ruled for over 50 years.
Frustration boiled over when a small band of soldiers briefly took over state radio last week and called for him to step aside.
In an apparent effort to shore up his political base after a failed coup attempt, Bongo flew back to Gabon on Monday to swear in a new government. From televised footage of the ceremony it was not clear if he could walk or move his right arm.
A government source on Thursday told Reuters Bongo returned to Morocco on Tuesday evening to continue his rehabilitation, but did not give further details. 
The president had previously appeared in a televised New Year's address in which he slurred his speech.
Ali Bongo took over the presidency upon his father Omar's death in 2009. He won re-election in 2016 by fewer than 6,000 votes amid widespread accusations of fraud, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched.

Officials said they were not losing hope to would find the boy alive. Rescuers were now digging tunnels to reach the child who, fell into the well which is just 25 cm (10 inches) wide and 100 meters (328 feet) deep.
""The most important here is to be able to get close to the boy. Either horizontally or vertically, in order to start the mining work to reach the place where the boy is at the moment,"" mining engineer Juan Escobar told reporters at the site in Totalan, Malaga.

AMSTERDAM/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey deported a 31-year-old journalist on Thursday who works for Dutch newspapers, accusing her of links to the militant Nusra Front, an al Qaeda offshoot involved in neighboring Syria's war.
Dutch prosecution spokeswoman Jeichien de Graaff confirmed that Ans Boersma, who was put on a plane back to the Netherlands, was a suspect in an ongoing investigation into militant activity.
""She is not personally believed to have been involved in a terrorist crime,"" but is a person of interest in a wider investigation into several suspects, de Graaff said. She is wanted for questioning about her alleged marginal involvement, but has not been taken into custody.
It was unclear exactly what Turkish authorities believe Boersma did wrong. The Netherlands sought assistance from Turkish authorities for their case, but had not requested her extradition.
Turkish officials said Boersma had ""suspected terrorism links"" and later referred to the Nusra Front, which now falls under the Tahrir al-Sham umbrella, the most powerful jihadist alliance in Syria's Idlib province bordering Turkey. 
TERRORIST LINKS
President Tayyip Erdogan's office said Turkish authorities had received Dutch police intelligence saying Boersma ""had links to a designated terrorist organization (as well as) a request for information about her movements in and out of Turkey.""
Turkey's presidential palace said Boersma - who was educated in Christian schools and had worked as an intern at a Christian charity - was deported for security reasons, not for her journalism work.
In September Boersma wrote an article for the Dutch national daily Trouw about northwest Syria's Afrin region, where Turkey has launched cross-border military operations to drive out the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist organization.
The Financieele Dagblad (FD) newspaper, one of several publications for which Boersma wrote, called her expulsion a ""flagrant violation of press freedom"".
Boersma had been visiting an immigration office in Istanbul to extend her visa on Wednesday when she was detained, the FD said. ""And suddenly you’re sitting in the airplane back to the Netherlands,"" Boersma said in a tweet on Thursday. ""I've been ""declared an 'undesirable person' in Turkey."" 
Terrorism-related investigations in Turkey often cite alleged links to Kurdish militants or the network of a U.S.-based Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a failed military coup in 2016.
Boersma began working as a correspondent in Turkey in 2017 and had previously been a journalism teacher. Her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page said she received a bachelors degree in journalism and a masters in anthropology at Amsterdam's VU University.
Turkey, the world's biggest jailer of journalists, ranks 157th out of 180 countries in the 2018 World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders.

It is not clear how Shah, a key lieutenant of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, contracted the H1N1 influenza.
""AmitShah is doing well. He will be discharged in a day or two. Thanks everyone for your good wishes!"", Anil Baluni, spokesman of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said in a tweet.
Health officials said lower than normal temperatures this winter have led to a spike in cases of swine flu in northern India.
""Cases of seasonal swine flu in India go up during winters and this January the winter is proving particularly harsh,"" said R. S. Taneja, the head of the medicine department at Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.
Overall, though, the National Centre for Disease Control said 13,447 cases of H1N1 virus were reported by Dec. 9 of last year compared to 38,811 in 2017.

Shah is the second top member of Modi's inner circle to fall ill. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley left for the United States earlier this week for a medical check-up, officials said. They did not provide details of his condition.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",Kyrgyz police disperse anti-Chinese rally,"BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyz police detained more than a dozen people on Thursday as they dispersed a hundreds-strong anti-Chinese rally in the capital, Bishkek, the biggest public protest to date in Central Asia against Beijing's growing influence in the region.
Protesters who gathered on the central square demanded curbs on work permits for Chinese citizens as well as a reduction of Kyrgyz debt to China and called for other measures to reduce the Chinese presence, including a ban on Kyrgyz-Chinese marriages.
After the rally ran beyond its allotted time, dozens of protesters started moving toward a building which houses the president and parliament, at which point police started detaining some people and squeezing others out of the square.
Police declined to say how many people they had detained. A Reuters reporter at the scene saw them lead away more than a dozen.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has grown in the former Soviet republic of six million people since an incident at Bishkek's main power plant a year ago caused a five-day blackout following its upgrade carried out by a Chinese firm. The firm has not been officially charged with any wrongdoing.
Hostility toward Beijing has also been fueled by reports of mass detentions of ethnic Kyrgyz - alongside fellow Turkic Muslims such as Uighurs and Kazakhs - in China's western province of Xinjiang.
Beijing has defended its so-called ""vocational education training centers"", which it says are part of a de-radicalization program in Xinjiang.
In 2016, three Chinese embassy staff were injured when a suicide bomber rammed the gates of the building in his car which then exploded. Bishkek blamed the attack on Uighur militants.
China is one of the biggest investors in Central Asia and a key trading partner for the region, which Beijing has made a key part of its Belt and Road development project.
Commenting on the protest, Kyrgyz First Deputy Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov said in a statement that protesters had been misled by fearmongering and that the annual net influx of Chinese to Kyrgyzstan had been below 1,000 people in the last two years.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>",Factbox: UK PM May's Brexit 'plan B' - What happens next in parliament?,"By Kylie MacLellan and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's parliament is at an impasse after lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal earlier this week.
May has said she would meet with senior parliamentarians from all parties to try and find a deal that could command the support of parliament and was ""genuinely negotiable"".
Below is what is due to happen next in parliament: 
JAN. 21: MAY PROPOSES NEXT STEPS
May will make a statement and put forward a motion in parliament on her proposed next steps on Brexit. Parliament will not debate the motion at this point.
JAN. 21-29: LAWMAKERS PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES
After May has published that motion, lawmakers will be able to propose amendments to it, setting out alternatives to the prime minister's deal. 
Parliament is deeply divided over Brexit, with different factions of lawmakers supporting a wide range of options including leaving without a deal, holding a second referendum and seeking a customs union with the EU.
An amendment expected to be put forward by Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles would go further than simply proposing an alternative Brexit approach. He proposes to effectively give parliament control of the process by changing parliamentary rules to allow non-government lawmakers, known as backbenchers, to propose new legislation.
JAN. 29: PARLIAMENT DEBATES NEXT STEPS
Parliament will hold a whole day of debate on May's proposed next steps, and the alternatives put forward by other lawmakers.
They will not be asked to vote to approve a revised Brexit deal at this stage, but votes on the alternatives proposed by lawmakers should give an indication of whether there is any way forward which is supported by a majority in parliament.
May does not have to pursue any alternatives supported by parliament but would be under huge political pressure to do so.
If an option were approved by a majority of lawmakers, May could go back to the EU and seek changes to her Brexit deal. Parliament would ultimately still need to vote on any revised deal, but it is not clear when that might happen.

If the Boles amendment is approved, he has proposed legislation which would give the government until early March to secure a new deal with the EU that has support of the majority of lawmakers. If it cannot, it would require May to request an extension to Article 50, to avoid leaving without a deal on March 29.

Sturgeon has been under pressure from her nationalist party supporters to set another vote on independence since Britain became mired in the complexities of leaving the European Union. 
She has been indicating for months that she would provide clarity on the secession issue once the outcome of Brexit was clear. 
Asked to confirm if this would be in coming weeks regardless of the timing on Brexit being pushed back by an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period, she replied ""yes.""
""It could be that the extension of Article 50 could be a reprieve of Brexit and not a solution, so yes, there is water to go under the bridge in a matter of weeks, and when it has done so I will make my views on a choice on independence clear,"" she told the Scottish parliament.
Scotland, which has 8 percent of the United Kingdom's population, voted to keep its EU membership in 2016 although Britain as a whole voted to leave in a referendum. Relations between Edinburgh's devolved government and Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative government have been strained ever since.
However any binding vote on Scottish secession must take place via a so-called Section 30 order granted by Britain's parliament. In 2017, May declined to give permission for such a vote while Brexit was going on. 
""That option of independence must be open and when the people of Scotland have the ability to choose, I believe that Scotland will opt to be an independent country,"" Sturgeon said.

In a 2014 referendum, Scots voted 55 to 45 percent against breaking away from the United Kingdom. Support for independence is still at around 45 percent, though polls show increasing Scottish opposition to May's Brexit plans.

The man was abducted after nightfall on Tuesday by a dozen gunmen on a mining site owned by Vancouver-based Progress Minerals in the northeast near the border with Niger, an area that the government says is under growing threat from armed jihadists. 
""It's the Canadian that was found last night in the province of Oudalan,"" said spokesman Jean Paul Badoum.
The death will fan concerns that the influence of violent groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State has spread uncontested into Burkina from neighboring Mali and Niger. 
Attacks by Islamist militants have surged in the West African country in recent months. A state of emergency in several northern provinces has been in effect since Dec. 31.
Canadian media identified the kidnapped man as Kirk Woodman. In a statement to CTV News, the family on Wednesday asked for privacy.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday the government was aware that a Canadian was missing in Burkina Faso and said it was working with local authorities.
Earlier this month, another Canadian man and an Italian woman went missing in Burkina, the security minister said. There has been no word since then on their fate. 
Security has deteriorated over the last few years across the remote and arid Sahel region just south of the Sahara Desert. In response, the United States, France and other European powers have sent troops and equipment to help stamp out the threat.
Tuesday’s kidnapping occurred on the third anniversary of an attack at a hotel in the center of the capital, Ouagadougou, that killed dozens, shocking a country that until then had largely been spared the violence that plagued its neighbors.
That attack was claimed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

MONTAUT, France (Reuters) - French producers of foie gras, the rich liver delicacy made from force-feeding grain to ducks or geese, have denounced a ban on the product in California, saying they make the creamy paté humanely, following all the rules.
California has formally blocked the sale and production of foie gras (literally ""fat liver"") since 2012. That ban has now been reinforced after the U.S. Supreme Court declined last week to hear an appeal brought by farmers and chefs. Violators will be fined up to $1,000 if caught selling the product.
In France, which makes around 70 percent of the world's foie gras, farmers and high-end producers see a double-standard, arguing that they treat the animals well, with no harm done to them during the fattening process.
""Everyone can think what they like, but I know I'm proud of what I do,"" said Julien, a farmer in Montaut, in the southwest of France, one of the main producing regions. He did not give his last name for fear of reprisal from rights' activists.
""I really look after them because, like I said, that's how I make a living. If I don't look after them I don't have any money at the end of the month, I can't pay my bills -- so there's nothing to be gained for me in mistreating the animals.""
In California, animal-rights campaigners have picketed high-end restaurants that serve foie gras, denouncing the manufacturing process as an unnecessary cruelty to animals. 
The U.S. Animal Legal Defense Fund said the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the appeal by the foie gras industry represented a ""death knell"" for the product in California and would spare thousands of ducks from ""terrible suffering"".
The force-feeding, known as ""gavage"", involves inserting a metal tube into the animals' throats, allowing them to consume far more grain than they would naturally eat and fattening their livers by up to 10 times the normal size.
Some decorated chefs, including France's Albert Roux, are opposed to foie gras, no longer serving it in their restaurants, while many supermarket chains also will not stock it.
Fabien Chevalier, the managing director of France's Lafitte Foie Gras, said California was wrong to ban a product he said conformed to global hygiene regulations and was freely traded.
""If we can't sell it in the U.S. we will go elsewhere,"" he told Reuters. ""Today, Asian customers love our product. If we take the example of Japan, it's a developed economy, Japan is the second biggest consumer of foie gras in the world.""

In France, foie gras has been recognized as part of the nation's ""cultural and gastronomic heritage"" since 2006. But several European countries ban its production, including the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Britain, and there are similar bans in Australia and Argentina.

But Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, warned against any move by Europe to join Washington in withdrawing from the agreement, since the accord was intended solely to halt Iran's nuclear program and did not address other behavior in the region or spying.
Germany, which together with France has led efforts to keep the agreement in place, expressed grave concern this week to a senior Iranian diplomat about the case of an Afghan-German man who was arrested on Tuesday for suspected espionage.
""The foreign ministry addressed the case unmistakably with the manager of the Iranian embassy on Jan. 15 and expressed our grave concern about the suspected intelligence activities,"" a ministry source said.
Ischinger, a former German ambassador in Washington, condemned Iran's actions, but said it was illusory to think that Iran or other governments would curb their espionage activities even if there was a formal agreement covering such actions.
""Iran should be smart enough to realize that is shooting itself in the foot because it is harming the political mood surrounding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) ... but that is no reason to rip up the agreement,"" he said.
Iran's actions in Germany and elsewhere were raising political concerns and overshadowing efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive, he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Jawad Zarif will be one of more than 100 heads of state and other senior world leaders at this year's Munich Security Conference, to be held in Munich Feb 15-17, Ischinger said. 

Leaders planning to attend include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and senior officials including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Saudi State Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, he added.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Rohingya Muslim families have left India for Bangladesh since seven Rohingya men were deported to their home country Myanmar in October, community leaders said on Thursday, and more were preparing to flee a crackdown.
India's Hindu nationalist government regards the Rohingya as illegal aliens and a security risk, and has ordered that tens of thousands of them who live in scattered settlements and slums be identified and repatriated.
This month it deported a Rohingya family of five to Buddhist-majority Myanmar, the second expulsion in three months.
That has worried the community given that the United Nations says conditions are not conducive for them to return to Myanmar after fleeing violence and persecution over the years. 
""Many people in India have given statements like launching a 'kill movement',"" said Mohammed Arfaat, a Rohingya youth leader who left for Bangladesh in October after six years in the northern Indian city of Jammu.
Arfaat, a 24-year-old father of two, was referring to a call by the Jammu Chamber of Commerce & Industry for an ""identify and kill movement"" against the Rohingya.
""We already faced so many problems in our country and we needed freedom to live elsewhere. But, if like in Myanmar, you are fearful again, why would you live there?,"" Arfaat said by phone from Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.
Nearly 2,000 Rohingya have gone to Bangladesh in the past few months, according to Arfaat and another youth leader.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Bangladesh said on Thursday the Rohingya arriving from India were ""all safe and sound"" and receiving assistance.
""Very small numbers of people coming in from Myanmar now,"" UNHCR spokesman Firas Al-khateeb said by phone from Cox's Bazar. ""The majority of them have come from India this month.""
India estimates that 40,000 Rohingya live in camps across the country, mainly in Jammu, Hyderabad and the capital, New Delhi. Only 16,500 have UNHCR identity cards the agency says can help ""prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation"".
The Indian government does not recognize the cards and rejects a U.N. position that deporting the Rohingya violates the principle of refoulement – sending refugees back to a place where they face danger.
Sahidullah, who lives in Jammu and cleans an auto showroom to support his wife and four children, said he did not want to leave India.
""I want to live here as long as needed,"" said Sahidullah, who goes by one name. ""Many people have left and my relatives will be deported too, but it's not yet safe in Myanmar.""
In August, a U.N. report accused the Myanmar military of mass killings and rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" in 2017 in an operation that drove more than 700,000 of them to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.

Myanmar has denied the charges, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim militants.

U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been leading efforts to broker an agreement with the Afghan Taliban, was due in Pakistan on Thursday following meetings with Ghani and other Afghan officials in Kabul.
On Thursday, Ghani called Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and ""expressed his gratitude for Pakistan's sincere facilitation of these efforts"", according to a statement from the Pakistan government spokesman's office.
The two leaders also issued invitations to visit their respective countries and agreed ""to remain engaged and create an environment for resolving all outstanding issues"", it said.
Afghanistan's frequently hostile relations with Pakistan, which it has regularly accused of supporting the Taliban, have warmed somewhat as regional countries have joined the effort to push the insurgents to open talks with Kabul.
Pakistani officials deny supporting the Taliban and say Islamabad is strongly in favor of a settlement that would maintain stability in Afghanistan and prevent a disastrous economic collapse of its neighbor.
Taliban officials said this week that Pakistan was putting pressure on its leaders to accept talks with the Afghan government, detaining a senior leader in the city of Peshawar before releasing him a few days later.
Taliban representatives have met Khalilzad on at least three occasions but have so far refused to talk directly to the internationally recognized Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate regime put in place by foreign powers.

The date of Khalilzad's next meeting with Taliban officials remains unclear after the insurgents threatened to stall the process over disagreements about plans to withdraw international forces from Afghanistan.

HAIFA, Israel (Reuters) - An Israeli museum plans to withdraw a sculpture depicting the McDonald's mascot as the crucified Jesus following protests which briefly united the country's Christian minority, its populist culture minister and the pro-Palestinian artist.
The life-sized sculpture showing the Ronald McDonald clown on a cross has been at the center of an exhibition about consumerism and religion. Other pieces depict Jesus and the Virgin Mary as Ken and Barbie children's dolls.
Protests became violent on Friday. Police said they arrested one man on suspicion of assault and were searching for two others people who threw firebombs at the Haifa Museum of Art. 
Three police officers were hurt as dozens of protesters tried to forcibly enter the museum, police said. Panes of glass along its entrance were smashed. Protests continued on Saturday.
""I object to this disgraceful sculpture,"" said Nicola Abdo, a Haifa resident and protester. ""As a Christian person ... I take deep offense to this depiction of our symbols.""
The mayor of the Jewish-Arab city of Haifa said on Thursday the sculpture would be taken out of the exhibition following consultations with church leaders.
""The sculpture will be removed and returned as soon as possible,"" Einat Kalish Rotem tweeted. ""We regret the aggravation the Christian community experienced ... and the physical injury and violence that surrounded it."" 
She did not say when it would be removed, but it had been due to be returned to the Finnish museum that loaned it last year at the end of the month.
Christian Arabs, who make up around 2 percent of the Jewish majority country's population, found a champion for their anger in Miri Regev, the culture minister whose censure of art deemed pro-Palestinian has made her a darling of the Israeli right.
Citing the injury to religious sensitivities, Regev had threatened to cut state funds to the museum. Israel's Justice Ministry slapped her down, arguing she had no such authority.
The McJesus sculptor, Jani Leinonen, from Finland, had also demanded that the exhibit be removed as he was boycotting Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. 
Others saw in Thursday's decision a chance for reconciliation.

""The winner today is the people of Haifa,” said Wadie Abu Nassar, an adviser to local church leaders. ""The removal of this sculpture is a reflection our desire to coexist in the city.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The commander of one of the largest Army bases in the United States promised residents to fix a “broken” housing system in which maintenance lapses by a private landlord left military families in homes with health and safety hazards.
The garrison commander at Maryland’s Fort Meade made the remarks in meetings with residents this month in response to a Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-developer in December that detailed the problems, which ranged from mold and rodent infestations to flooding, crumbling roofs and ceiling collapses. Many tenants accused the closely held civilian company that runs most housing at Fort Meade, Rhode Island's Corvias Group, of routinely failing to make repairs.
“Based on the Reuters articles, we failed you. I failed you,” Colonel Erich C. Spragg, Meade’s garrison commander, told families at a January 11 town hall meeting.
""Why are we here tonight? I'll tell you why: because this is broken,” Spragg said of the Meade housing system, operated by a public-private venture between the Army and Corvias. “I've got to figure out where it's broken, and we have to fix it.”
Corvias staff also spoke at the meetings, acknowledging lapses and pledging improvements, according to audio recordings that were shared with Reuters.
“Trust is hard to earn back, and we’re going to do what we can to earn that back,” JC Calder, Corvias’s operations director at Meade, told residents.
Meade and Corvias promised to overhaul the system for placing repair requests to more swiftly complete fixes. The garrison commander is convening resident focus groups to identify housing lapses.
Owned by real estate developer John Picerne, Corvias operates more than 26,000 family homes across 13 U.S. Army and Air Force bases under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative. It is slated to earn more than $1 billion in fees over 50-year contracts, Reuters found.
Asked about the new promises to Meade residents, Corvias spokeswoman Kelly Douglas said in a statement: “Our core mission at Corvias is clear: put service members and their families first. We can do better, and will do better, in addressing any resident issues.”
She said the company already has a high rate of completing work orders, but “to respond to resident issues more quickly,” is adding additional maintenance and service staff.
In a statement Wednesday, the Army said it is “committed to providing a safe and secure environment on our installations,” and said it recently completed visual inspections of 10 percent of family housing units nationwide with children ages six or younger. 
The Army began the inspection https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-cleanup-exclusive/exclusive-us-army-forms-plan-to-test-40000-homes-for-lead-following-reuters-report-idUSKCN1LC1ZH program last year after Reuters found lead poisoning hazards https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-housing on several bases. 
The results, the Army said, “will inform our long-term plan to address issues across the force.”
Fort Meade is the site of a major U.S. Army contingent and home to the secretive National Security Agency. Corvias operates around 3,000 family homes on the base.
The Meade meetings represent the latest promise for military housing reform since a Reuters series, Ambushed at Home https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-military, documented hazards nationwide.
Last month, Reuters detailed housing concerns at Fort Meade and two other bases where Corvias operates, North Carolina’s Fort Bragg and Louisiana’s Fort Polk, where a subsequent online petition https://www.change.org/p/corvias-fort-polk-hold-corvias-accountable to “hold Corvias accountable” has gained 5,000 signatures. Corvias said it is reviewing its service request system to better address resident concerns at all bases where it operates.
At the two Meade town hall sessions last week, some families described mold sickening their children, unexplained charges from their landlord, days without heat, and problems that forced them to move in temporarily with neighbors.
Corvias is among more than a dozen private real estate firms housing service families on U.S. bases under the two-decade-old privatization program.
Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, this month told a local TV station https://www.wpri.com/target-12/ri-developer-under-scrutiny-following-military-housing-probe/1685307711 he would press for Senate hearings to explore base housing conditions across the country.
Before Corvias took over Fort Bragg housing in 2003, Reed helped make introductions for Picerne at the Army post, and credited his work serving military families. After the Reuters report, Reed said the Senate should review operations of all contractors, including Corvias.

LONDON (Reuters) - Donating billions of dollars to global funds that fight poverty and disease is one of the best investments governments can make to boost security and economic growth, philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates said on Thursday.
Ending epidemics of infectious diseases such as malaria, polio, HIV and malaria is proving tough, they said, but dramatic progress made by global aid mechanisms recent decades means the world's people are now healthier and more productive.
""The data has been really striking,"" Melinda Gates told reporters on a teleconference. 
She cited figures from the World Health Organization and others showing that since 1990, under-five mortality rates have fallen by more than 50 percent, and deaths due to infectious diseases like HIV, malaria and measles have also halved.
""A child born today is half as likely to die before the age of five, compared to if she was born in 2000,"" Melinda Gates said. ""The human and economic benefits of this are enormous.""
The multi-billion dollar philanthropic Gates Foundation she co-chairs with her husband Bill, the co-founder of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is one of the largest funders of global health program aimed at helping poor people escape disease, poverty and premature death.
The Foundation is seeking to encourage international donor governments such as the United States, Japan, Australia, Germany, Britain and many others to replenish four key global funds in the next 18 months so they can continue their work.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Incoming Pakistan Chief Justice opens new era for powerful court,"By Saad Sayeed
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan swears in a new chief justice on Friday, opening the next chapter for the Supreme Court which has made a name for an expansive agenda that has ranged from ousting a prime minister to pressing authorities to improve the public water supply.
Outgoing Chief Justice Saqib Nisar cultivated a high profile, launching multiple inquiries aimed at reforming public institutions and going after political leaders, attracting both praise for cracking down on abuse and criticism that he was exceeding the court's role.
His successor, Supreme Court judge Asif Saeed Khosa, has a taste for literary quotation but is otherwise considered a more classical judge, preferring to stay out of the limelight. 
""I think Justice Khosa's tenure will be substantially different,"" said Saroop Ijaz, a lawyer for Human Rights Watch, who has been critical of Nisar's activist court.
In one of its best-known judgments, the Supreme Court removed three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office in July 2017 and ordered a corruption probe into his assets that led to Sharif being given a seven-year jail term in December.
The court enraged hardline Islamists last year by overturning the conviction of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman condemned to death for blasphemy against Islam.
But it has also used so-called ""suo motu"" provisions in Pakistani law that allow the court to open cases on its own initiative to set its stamp on wide swaths of public life and denounce the failure of public institutions.
It has ordered inquiries into issues ranging from payments to farmers by powerful sugar mills to milk prices, city water supplies and corruption allegations against managers of the railways and national airline PIA.
However the outgoing chief justice's activism did little to drain the backlog of more than 40,000 cases at the Supreme Court and a staggering 1.9 million combined cases pending in other courts. 
""It's a highly problematic period at multiple levels,"" said legal scholar Osama Siddique, an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Development and Economic Alternatives in Lahore. 
""Justice Saqib Nisar's entire emphasis was on other institutions and how they should improve their governance but he did not do anything to improve the governance and internal administration of the judiciary.""
CAUTIONARY TALE
Nisar's high media profile has drawn parallels with Iftikhar Chaudhry, a chief justice who initially won plaudits for helping oust military dictator Pervez Musharraf in 2008, but was later criticized for overstepping his constitutional remit.
""Saqib Nisar's tenure was in many ways a cautionary tale in unfettered judicial overreach,"" said Ijaz. ""It was unprecedented in the extent of its activism and disregard of formal legal procedures.""
Nisar himself has said his suo motu cases and frequent public appearances to inspect development projects and facilities such as schools and hospitals were aimed at protecting the poor.
Allies of Sharif say his assertiveness served the interests of Pakistan's powerful military and hinted at a return to the past, when they say judges cut politicians down to size at the behest of the generals. 
The military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its history since independence in 1947, denies involvement in domestic politics.
But Sharif's removal and the defeat of his PML-N party in elections last year led to the appointment as prime minister of Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician seen by analysts and opposition politicians as close to the military.
The new Chief Justice, who will hold office for 11 months, has a tough task to reform Pakistan's sluggish judiciary. 
Khosa wrote the judgment that ousted Sharif, opening with an epigraph he took from ""The Godfather"", Mario Puzo's bestselling novel on the mafia: ""Behind every great fortune there is a crime.""
But literary flourishes apart, Ijaz said his record suggested he would adopt a much lower profile than his interventionist predecessor.

""Khosa has in the past written strongly worded judgments (and) has never shown a desire for publicity... The hope is that he will continue on that theme and work towards reform, starting with the judiciary itself.""

Guizhou-based Moutai is the world's largest alcohol firm by market cap, valued at around $110 billion, and sells the pungent liquor baijiu for more than $200 per 500 ml bottle.
The brand has close ties to Chinese politics and has largely weathered a crackdown on luxury spending under President Xi Jinping, who has called on Communist Party officials to be frugal, upright and disciplined.
Officials, their spouses and children are prohibited from taking part in the operations of Moutai, according to new rules posted online by the Guizhou Discipline Inspection Commission, the provincial anti-corruption watchdog.
Cadres are also banned from using the power and influence of their position to acquire Moutai business licenses for people they have a ""special relationship"" with, or to raise sales targets and help facilitate resales at a profit, the rules said.
Cadres should ""educate and properly manage"" relatives and those close to them to avoid breaking the new rules, the document said.
Officials who engage in any form of business-related interaction with the company have to be recorded in a new registry and failing to do so will trigger a ""serious"" investigation, the watchdog said.
Moutai's baijiu liquor is often a lubricant at official banquets and business dinners, and it was once hailed as helping China's Red Army survive the tortuous Long March in the 1930s.
The company in October posted its weakest quarterly profit since 2015, depressing its shares and raising concerns about the luxury liquor market.

Moutai on Jan. 2 announced a higher than expected sales target for 2019, leading analysts to predict sustained stable growth in the medium-and-long run.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 06:17AM ET</span>","Zimbabwe doctors treat 68 for gunshot wounds, police arrest hundreds","By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean doctors said on Thursday they had treated nearly 70 people for gunshot wounds while police rounded up hundreds after violent protests this week triggered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's decision to steeply raise fuel prices.
While some businesses and banks opened after the three-day stay-at-home strike, inflation data for December showed the annual consumer price index soaring to 42 percent, adding more woes to citizens struggling with daily life. 
Zimbabweans had hoped Mnangagwa would make good on pre-election pledges to revive the economy and break with the Robert Mugabe era, but Zimbabwe has fallen back into familiar ways.
The protests, which took place only five months after six people were killed in post-election demonstrations last August, pose a challenge for Mnangagwa who promised to repair the struggling economy after he replaced long-time leader Mugabe following a coup in November 2017.
Three people died during the protests but rights groups, lawyers and witnesses said scores were beaten by soldiers in a crackdown on dissent by security forces.
State broadcaster ZBC said 600 people, including a prominent activist and an opposition legislator, have been detained over the protests. A Zimbabwean lawyers' group said it was so far representing more than 130 people arrested for protesting.
Evan Mawarire, a Harare pastor who rose to prominence as a Mugabe critic and led a national protest shutdown in 2016, will on Thursday appear in court to face public violence charges.
Courts dismissed two similar charges against him in 2017 for lack of evidence.
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR) said its members had treated 172 people, some with dog bites, in private and public hospitals since Monday, when the protests erupted in the capital, Harare, and the second city, Bulawayo.
""There are cases of patients who had chest trauma and fractured limbs who were forcibly taken from hospital to attend court despite the advise of doctors,"" ZAHDR said in a statement. 
The casualty list included 68 people treated for gunshot wounds, 17 of whom underwent emergency surgery.
FUEL SHORTAGES REMAIN
Some businesses and banks re-opened in the capital but others remained closed as calm returned on Thursday. But in the second city of Bulawayo, which witnessed widespread looting, businesses remained shut, local journalists in the city said.
At a branch owned by Stanbic Bank in Harare, the banking halls were empty with no customers and workers. An official said workers did not report for duty because they could not find public transport. There were very few public taxis on the road, leaving many people stranded.
Long lines formed at the few filling stations selling fuel and in central Harare, soldiers in two army lorries kept an eye at a garage selling petrol.
Media platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter remained blocked because of a government order, leading to accusations that it wanted to prevent images of heavy-handedness from being broadcast around the world.
""Things are beginning to normalize now so going to work is the only option otherwise our families will suffer,"" said James Vambe, a trader in Harare.

Dollar shortages are battering the economy, rocketing inflation is destroying the value of citizens' savings and the government is reacting forcefully to crush dissent.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Nineteen people still missing two days after a Somali militant attack on a Nairobi hotel and office complex that killed 21 people are now accounted for, the Kenyan Red Cross said on Thursday.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Wednesday evening that a 20-hour siege had ended with security forces killing all the Somali militants who had stormed the hotel complex, forcing hundreds of people into terrifying escapes.
Late on Wednesday, the Red Cross had said it had yet to account for 19 of 94 people it had been tracing. ""All 94 cases have been closed positively as of (now),"" it said in a statement at 12:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) on Thursday, giving no further detail.
Al Shabaab, a Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate fighting to impose strict Islamic law, said it carried the assault on the upscale dusitD2 compound over U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
Kenya, the East African hub for multinational companies and the United Nations, became a frequent target for al Shabaab after Kenya sent troops into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to try to create a buffer zone along its border.
In a two-page statement claiming responsibility for the attack, al Shabaab did not spell out why it had chosen to hit Kenya over Trump's December 2017 decision on Jerusalem. 
It said the attack was ""a response to the witless remarks of U.S. president, Donald Trump, and his declaration"", and that it was targeting ""Western and Zionist interests worldwide and in support of our Muslim families in Palestine"".
Asked about the claim, a White House National Security Council spokesman said in a statement: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism.""
The bloody bodies of five attackers were broadcast across social media as Kenyatta announced the end of the siege, which echoed a 2013 al Shabaab assault that killed 67 people in the Westgate shopping center in the same district.

Sixteen Kenyans including a policeman, an American survivor of the Sept. 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States, and a British development worker were among the dead in the hotel 14 Riverside Drive complex, Nairobi police chief Joseph Boinnet said.

In the latest twist in a case which has strained ties between Britain and Russia, RT said it would seek a judicial review over the December ruling by Ofcom that the broadcaster broke impartiality rules in news and current affairs programs. 
The poisoning, which Britain blamed on Russia, strained relations between the two countries and led to the biggest Western expulsions of diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Russia has denied any involvement. 
Its media regulator has launched an investigation into the activities of British public broadcaster the BBC.
In its ruling, Ofcom said RT failed to give sufficient weight to a range of views in seven current affairs discussion or news items.
""Today RT has informed Ofcom that it will be seeking judicial review of Ofcom's decisions and process in its breach findings of 20th December against the network,"" RT said in a statement. 
""Ofcom investigated 10 RT programs, and decided that 7 were in breach; we firmly believe that none were in breach. RT is left with no choice other than to seek judicial review of the matter.""
Russian officials say RT is a way for Moscow to compete with the dominance of global media companies based in the United States and Britain which they say offer a particular view of the world.
Critics say RT, which broadcasts news in English, Arabic and Spanish, is the propaganda arm of the Russian state and aims is to undermine confidence in Western institutions.
Ofcom has said it will consider further representations made by the licensee, and could impose sanctions ranging from broadcasting a statement of Ofcom's findings to a financial penalty and, in the most extreme cases, revoking a license.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Rail, bus and air traffic stopped in Tunisia on Thursday after the powerful UGTT union staged a one-day nationwide strike to protest against the government's refusal to raise the salaries of 670,000 public servants.
Tunisia is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to freeze public sector wages as part of reforms to help reduce its budget deficit.
The one-day strike hit airports, ports, schools, hospitals, state media and government offices.
Tunisia's state-owned airline Tunisair expects major disruptions to its flight schedule due to the strike and urged customers to change bookings.
At Tunis Carthage airport, most flights were canceled and check-in counters closed, leaving hundreds of angry passengers stranded. 
Chahed said the strike would be very expensive but that the government could not afford to raise wages.
Sami Tahri, Deputy Secretary-General of the UGTT, said the government had come under the dictates of the IMF and had opted for a confrontation with public servants in a bid to find a solution.
Government and union sources told Reuters that the government had proposed spending about $400 million on pay rises whereas the UGTT had asked for about $850 million. Tunisia struck a deal with the IMF in December 2016 for a loan programme worth around $2.8 billion to overhaul its ailing economy with steps to cut chronic deficits and trim bloated public services, but progress has been slow.

Tunisia's economy has been in crisis since the toppling of autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali threw it into turmoil, with unemployment and inflation shooting up. The government aims to cut the public sector wage bill to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 from the current 15.5 percent, one of the world’s highest levels according to the IMF.

PRAYAGRAJ, India (Reuters) - Ash-smeared and dreadlocked Naga sadhus or Hindu ascetics, naked except for rosary beads and garlands and smoking wooden pipes, are a huge draw at the world's largest religious festival that began this week in India. 
At the Kumbh Mela, or ""festival of the pot"", held this year in Prayagraj in north India, organizers expect up to 150 million people to bathe at the confluence of three holy rivers: the Ganges, the Yamuna and a mythical third river, the Saraswati. 
The festival is one of the only opportunities to see the reclusive Naga sadhus, some of whom live in caves after taking a vow of celibacy and renouncing worldly possessions. 
Their charge down to the waters to bathe at the opening of the Kumbh, many armed with tridents and swords, is one of the highlights of the festival. 
""It is a confluence of all Naga sadhus at the meeting point of these holy rivers,"" said Anandnad Saraswati, a Naga sadhu from Mathura, a holy city in north India. 
""They meet each other, they interact with each other and they meditate and pray here at the holy confluence. They give their message to the people and they transform people.""
Most of the Nagas enter the orders in their early teens, leaving their friends and families to immerse themselves in meditation, yoga and religious rituals. It can take years to be conferred with the title of a Naga, they say. 
""One has to live a life of celibacy for six years. After that the person is given the title of a great man and 12 years after that he is made a Naga,"" said Digambar Kedar Giri, a Naga sadhu from Jaipur.
During the eight-week Kumbh, generally held every three years in one of four cities in India, the Nagas live in makeshift monasteries called Akhara erected on the eastern banks of the Ganges.
They spend their days meditating, smoking cannabis and receiving a stream of visitors who come to pay their respects. 
""It feels surreal: all this time you have read about them. They are almost like fictional characters and then you meet them,"" said a woman who gave her name as Pallavi, on a visit to the Akharas. 

The Kumbh Mela has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pot containing the nectar of immortality from demons. In a 12-day fight for possession, four drops fell to earth, in the cities of Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik, who share the Kumbhs as a result.

HANOI (Reuters) - Hanoi is preparing to receive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a state visit, two sources told Reuters, while officials and diplomats said Vietnam is keen to host a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.
A source familiar with the matter said Kim will travel to Vietnam for an official state visit after the Feb. 4-8 lunar new year. A separate source confirmed Kim's visit but did not give any dates.
The United States and North Korea are holding high-level talks in Washington this week to discuss a second meeting between Trump and Kim to seek an ""interim"" deal to revitalize nuclear talks, U.S. and South Korean media have said.
Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the United States and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely venue for a second meeting.
The Southeast Asian country is keen to host the summit as a demonstration of its normalized ties with the United States, its foe during the Vietnam War, a Vietnamese government official and two diplomatic sources told Reuters.
The Vietnamese source did not confirm if a state visit by Kim would be combined with a U.S.-North Korean summit.
Media is heavily censored in Vietnam and the ruling Communist Party retains a tight control on information. The officials who spoke to Reuters did so on the strict condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the situation.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. 
A U.S. embassy spokeswoman in Hanoi said the embassy did not have anything to announce regarding the summit location, and referred questions to the White House.
Trump told reporters in Washington on Jan. 6 that the United States and North Korea are ""negotiating a location"" for a second summit, and that ""it will be announced probably in the not too distant future."" White House officials have declined to comment further.
Kim and Trump met for a historic summit in Singapore in June, but have since struggled to make progress towards denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Top North Korean officials, including former spy chief Kim Yong Chol, were seen at Beijing airport on Thursday, and are believed to be headed to the United States for meetings with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and possibly Trump.
Asked about a possible high-level meeting this week, a State Department spokesman said: ""We have no meetings to announce.""
""A1 VISIT"" IN DANANG
Both Hanoi and the central Vietnam city of Danang have been viewed by analysts as possible locations for a second summit. 
A senior Danang-based official said the city had not been asked to host such an event, but had received instructions to prepare for a possible ""A1"" visit, referring to a high-profile foreign leader.
A senior South Korean official earlier told Reuters that the United States has ""various options"" on the location, which would be decided after consultations with North Korea, while another official said that Vietnam is only one of the countries keen to host the summit. 
Vietnam, which rose from the ashes of a victorious but costly war with the United States and transformed itself into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, has developed close strategic ties with Washington.
In 2016, Washington ended a decades-old arms embargo on Vietnam, and last year a U.S. aircraft carrier visited Vietnam for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War.
Vietnam's exports to the United States, its largest export market, rose 14.3 percent last year to $47.53 billion, accounting for nearly 20 percent of Vietnam's total exports.
North Korea can learn from Vietnam's experience in building ties with the United States, said Le Dang Doanh, a Vietnamese economist and former government adviser who has given lectures to North Korean delegations visiting Vietnam.

""They asked a lot about how Vietnam can normalize relations with the United States after losing so many Vietnamese lives during the war,"" Doanh said. ""I told them we never forget the past, but we also look to the future.""

The body of Aiia Maasarwe, 21, was found by passers-by early on Wednesday near La Trobe University's Bundoora campus in the northeast of Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Police described her as an Israeli national. 
""This is an horrendous crime that has been inflicted on an innocent member of our community,"" Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper told a news briefing on Thursday.
""Our presumption is that this was a random attack and opportunistic,"" he said.
It was the second time in seven months that a young woman had been killed on her way home at night in Melbourne, which has an active night life and is popular with overseas university students.
Police said Maasarwe had taken a tram home after an evening out seeing a comedy show. She had been speaking with her sister on the phone at the time of the attack and her sister alerted authorities, Stamper said.
""She heard the sound of the fall, the phone falling to the ground and heard some voices and that was it,"" he said. 
Family members arrived from Israel on Thursday.
Maasarwe had been in Melbourne on a six-month study abroad program as part of a degree at Shanghai University.
Police said forensic testing was being conducted on two pieces of clothing found nearby that they believe was likely to have been left by the person responsible for her death.
In June, 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon was followed as she walked home from performing at a Melbourne comedy club before she was sexually assaulted and killed in a central park. 
Dixon's death provoked an outpouring of grief, with more than 5,000 people attending a vigil at the park, and a wider push by police to acknowledge that women should be free to come home alone late at night and be safe.
More broadly, Australia has been reviewing its policies around violence against women. Sixty-nine women died violently in Australia in 2018, up from 54 in 2017, according to community group Destroy the Joint.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2019 01:53AM ET</span>",UK PM May seeks to end Brexit stalemate after winning confidence vote,"By Kylie MacLellan and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May won a confidence vote in the British parliament on Wednesday and then appealed to lawmakers from across the political divide to come together to try to break the impasse on a Brexit divorce agreement.
Lawmakers voted 325 to 306 that they had confidence in May's government, just 24 hours after handing her European Union withdrawal deal a crushing defeat that left Britain's exit from the bloc in disarray.
With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Brexit, the United Kingdom is now in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.
After the results of the confidence vote were announced to cheers from her Conservative lawmakers, May said she believed parliament had a duty to find a solution that delivered on the 2016 Brexit referendum result.
But with lawmakers (MPs) deadlocked on the way forward, the United Kingdom could face a disorderly ""no-deal"" Brexit, a delay to Brexit, or even another referendum on membership. 
""Now MPs have made clear what they don’t want, we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want,"" May said in a statement outside her Downing Street office.
""That’s why I am inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward. This is now the time to put self-interest aside.""
After the confidence vote, May met several party leaders, but the main opposition leader, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, refused to hold talks unless a no-deal Brexit was ruled out. 
The votes on Tuesday and Wednesday brought into sharp relief the problem May faces; trying to win over pro-EU supporters in her own and other parties without alienating those who keep her in power - for instance, by giving up the ""no-deal Brexit"" that they see as a crucial bargaining chip. 
Hardline Conservative Brexit-supporters, who last month made an unsuccessful attempt to oust her as leader, and the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government will not countenance a deal that keeps close ties with the EU.
""The confidence and supply arrangement (to support May) of course is built upon delivering Brexit on the basis of our shared priorities,"" said Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
NO DEAL, NO TALKS
However, Corbyn said no positive talks were possible unless a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table. His party wants a permanent customs union with the EU, a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers.
May's spokesman said she was not ruling out a no-deal option and that it was government policy to be outside an EU customs union. Critics said this meant May was not budging from the deal that had alienated all sides in parliament. 
Other opposition parties wrote to Corbyn after the confidence vote to demand he now back a second referendum, which Labour has agreed should be considered if it cannot force an election.
However, he and other senior political figures fear that stopping Brexit could alienate the 17.4 million people who voted to leave. 
Sterling  was trading just off two-month highs against the euro after May won the confidence vote, with many investors believing the prospect of a no-deal exit had receded as parliament hardened its stance against it. [GBP/]
Companies warned of catastrophic job losses and chaos at ports if there was no deal. Trade with the EU would then default to basic World Trade Organization rules, which many argue would disrupt innumerable manufacturing supply chains relying on rapid, friction-free trade.
Ever since Britain voted by 52-48 percent to leave the EU in June 2016, the political class has been debating how to leave the European project forged by France and Germany after the devastation of World War Two.
""NO MORE GAMES""
Tuesday's crushing defeat appears to have killed off May's two-year strategy of forging an amicable divorce in which a status-quo transition period would be followed by Britain operating an independent trade policy alongside close ties to the EU, the world's biggest single market.
Other members of the EU, which combined has about six times Britain's economic might, called for discussion but indicated there was little chance of fundamental change to the deal May had negotiated. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that ""the time for playing games is now over"".
For the EU, already reeling from crises over debt and refugees, Brexit may be the biggest blow in its 60-year history, though its 27 other members have shown remarkable unity on the issue.
Brexit supporters anticipate some short-term economic pain but say Britain will then thrive if cut loose from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity. 

Opponents of Brexit say it is folly that will weaken the West, make Britain poorer and torpedo what remains of its post-imperial clout.

Rescuers have been struggling to pump water out of the 370-feet-deep illegal ""rat-hole"" coal mine in the northeastern state of Meghalaya, where the men have been trapped for 35 days.
""One body has been detected by Indian Navy divers using a remotely operated underwater vehicle at a depth of 160 feet,” the navy said on Twitter. 
""The body has been pulled up to the mouth of the rat-hole and shall be extracted out of the mine under the supervision of doctors,"" it said.
Rat-hole mines killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya before India's environmental court banned the practice in early 2014.
The mine, located at Ksan near the village of Lumthari in Meghalaya, became flooded after 15 miners went down the narrow pit on Dec. 13. 
A police official, who asked not to be identified, said a team of doctors, paramedics, and ambulances had been sent to help recover the body.
The slow progress of the rescue efforts has been contrasted with the dramatic rescue of 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave last July, which drew a massive international audience.

Thai authorities said Anastasia Vashukevich, 27, two other Belarussians and five Russians were being sent to their home countries two days after they pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and soliciting.
Vashukevich drew world attention last February when she said she had hours of audio recordings that could shed light on links between Russian officials and Trump's election in 2016.
She offered to release the recordings in exchange for asylum in the United States, but never produced evidence to substantiate her claim and later said she had no plans to release anything.
Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told media all eight deportees were willing to return to their countries. The deportations were being coordinated with Belarus and Russia, he said.
Vashukevich made no comment at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. Last year, she had said she feared that she would be sent to Russia.
Self-proclaimed ""sex guru"" Alexander Kirillov, 38, a fellow Belarussian among the deportees, told media the group had been seeking deportation since last March. 
""If you have been to a Thai prison, you are not afraid of anything,"" he said. 
They were arrested at the beach resort of Pattaya during a seminar on seduction techniques.
Vashukevich, who is also known as Nastya Rybka, said she had recordings of conversations on interference in the U.S. election through an association with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. But Deripaska's representatives have accused her of fabrication and said she was never his mistress.
Deripaska is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and is a onetime associate of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to boost Trump's chances of winning. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has said no collusion took place.

The family, who are traveling on British passports, were involved in a series of incidents in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and Hamilton this week that have shocked New Zealanders.
Peter Devoy, assistant general manager for Immigration New Zealand (INZ), told Reuters five individuals from the group had been served with Deportation Liability Notices, the first stage in the deportation process.
The individuals can appeal against the deportation orders and can only be deported if they agree to waive their appeal rights or if the appeal rights expire, he said in an emailed statement.
The group, which included children and women, made headlines in New Zealand newspapers after littering at the North Shore beach in Auckland and threatening residents. 
A video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed that a child, asked by a woman to clean up the rubbish, responded by saying he would ""knock your brains out"".
Police were called later the same day by staff at a Burger King outlet in the city of Hamilton, about 130 km (80 miles) south of Auckland, who complained that the group was causing a ruckus.
They had also been spotted in a number of cafes and restaurants in Auckland's central business district, and businesses had complained that they walked out without paying or had abused their employees.
A woman from the group was convicted on Wednesday for stealing a can of Red Bull, sunglasses and rope worth NZ$55.20 ($37.41) from a petrol station.
Immigration officers caught up with the group on Wednesday, after extensive media coverage, and handed them the deportation notices.
Devoy said the deportation notices could be issued for a number of reasons, including matters relating to character.
""INZ understands that the individuals intend to leave New Zealand next week,"" he said.
One member of the group, however, told reporters earlier this week they would cut short their trip and return home because they felt ""unwelcome"" in New Zealand.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 11:39PM ET</span>",Thai universities tap into rising Chinese demand,"By Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Chinese national Cherry He Ting rattles off in fluent Thai as she presents her masters thesis ahead of graduating from a Bangkok university, where she has studied for the past three and a half years.
The 28-year-old history student is among thousands of Chinese who join Thai universities every year, according to Thai government data, which shows their annual enrolment numbers have doubled since 2012.
Hit by years of declining enrolment of Thai students, the institutions are scrambling to meet this recent surge in demand as Chinese students look for alternatives to Western schools.
Chada Triamvithaya, an academic at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang who has been researching Chinese migration patterns in Thailand, said universities currently make twice the amount in tuition fees from Chinese students as they do from locals. 
""Apart from private universities, state universities, even one for Buddhist monks, are now creating courses aimed at attracting Chinese students. It is all about the money,"" she said, adding that the lure of rising Chinese demand in Thai education has already attracted Chinese investment into the sector.
Thai universities offer more affordable overseas study for Chinese students, compared with more popular destinations like Australia, the United States and Britain, Diane Hu, assistant professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University told Reuters.
Many of these Chinese students come from the largely rural, southern provinces, hoping to escape a highly competitive but poor education system back home and land well-paying jobs in Southeast Asia's second biggest economy.
""Further interest in southern provinces can be attributed to heightened trade ties between the two countries and Belt and Road-driven initiatives,"" Hu said.
China's Belt and Road program promotes expanding land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars pledged for infrastructure development.
Chinese students say Thailand offers better prospects because of lower tuition fees and friendlier visa rules than in the West.
Studying for an undergraduate business degree costs up to 120,000 baht ($3,700) a year in Thailand, while tuition fees for a similar course can range from $8,000 in Singapore to over $60,000 a year at some U.S. universities.
Chinese students are also facing greater scrutiny in countries like the United States, where the Trump administration is considering new background checks and other restrictions over growing espionage concerns.
""If I work here I will have more opportunities than where I came from,"" said Cherry, who first arrived in Chiang Rai in northern Thailand almost eight years ago as an exchange student.
She said she arrived by boat on the Mekong River from her hometown of Jinghong in southern China. She first studied tourism management at a university in Bangkok before doing a master degree in history at another university.
As many as 8,455 Chinese students enrolled in Thai universities in 2017, twice that in 2012. The total is as high as 30,000 across the country, according to research by the Asia Research Center for Migration at Chualongkorn University.
'SOFT POWER'
Thai universities rank well below those in neighbors like Singapore and Malaysia, according to the Times Higher Education World University Ranking, Both those countries have schools among Asia's top 50 whereas Thailand's top institution, Mahidol University, has slipped nearly 30 places in recent years to rank near 100 out of 400 schools across Asia.
Chinese demand has risen in spite of this, and both private and state universities now hope that rising foreign enrolment will help bring in more revenue and improve the quality of education.
""Chinese students are part of the soft power assertion of China into Thailand,"" said Chada at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, adding the rising number of students has been followed by a rise in Chinese teachers, translators, and academics getting more jobs in the Thai education sector.
Woraphong Dechasasawat, the vice president of one of the country's largest Chinese-language business schools, says the institution aims to find students from among the roughly three million Chinese who would struggle to find university placement back home each year.
""There will always be demand when you talk about China, it is about how ready are we in adapting to it,"" he said.
Part of Dhurakij Pundit, one of the country's largest private universities, the school started with 23 Chinese students in 2010 and now hosts about 3,700.
Some Chinese investors have even invested in private universities like Bangkok's Krirk university, with plans to introduce more courses aimed at the Chinese market, according to media.
Many researchers believe this trend will continue as China looks to expand its influence across Southeast Asia and beyond.
""The Belt and Road initiative has led to more Chinese students going to study along its corridors in the past year through government scholarships,"" Aksornsri Phanishsarn, an economist at Thammasat University told Reuters. 
""But Thailand has seen its own surge as well due to large trade and tourism between the two countries,"" said Aksornsri.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>",Mexico's new crime fighting national guard easily wins lower house approval,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve the creation of a new 60,000-member national guard, a proposal embraced by leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a crucial tool in the fight against organized crime.
The proposal was approved by about three-quarters of the lower house of Congress, 362 votes in favor and 119 against, with changes to Mexico's constitution requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers.
Lopez Obrador's MORENA party teamed up with smaller leftist allies and lawmakers from the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to approve the new national guard which would replace the armed forces in the fight against crime including drug cartels.
Critics of the new guard fear it could further militarize crime fighting and lead to human rights abuses. Even some reluctant backers of the bill called for changes that would place limits on the force and eliminate protections against prosecutions if members commit crimes against civilians.
In a first phase, the guard will be composed of some 60,000 members transferred from existing military and federal police forces, but it was not clear when it might include new hires.
According to the fine print of the proposal, the head of the force will be a civilian, but operational chiefs will be military officers.
The proposal must still be approved by the Senate, and then a simple majority of state legislatures, but both are seen as likely because of the political strength of MORENA and its allies across Mexico.
Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has said he also wants to address Mexico's long-running battle with gangland violence and lawlessness by tackling poverty and inequality. He has suggested the possibility of an amnesty for some lesser criminals.
The creation of the national guard is not the first time a new government has sought to put its stamp on security with a different policy.
The former administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto created a gendarmerie to oversee the fight against organized crime, but it was later heavily scaled back.

More than a decade ago, former President Felipe Calderon sent in the armed forces to fight warring drug cartels, but while the policy succeeded it killing or capturing cartel leaders, the criminal groups splintered and gang violence has since claimed more than 170,000 lives.

Ties between the two countries have been strained since the December arrest in Vancouver of a senior Chinese executive on a U.S. arrest warrant, which was followed by China's detention of two Canadians, on suspicion of endangering state security.
In the most recent incident, the woman, Ti-Anna Wang, was pulled off a plane by six police officers, separated from her husband and detained with her daughter for almost two hours while connecting in Beijing en route to Toronto from Seoul, the paper said.
""It was a shocking, terrifying and senseless ordeal with no purpose but to bully, punish and intimidate me and my family,"" Wang was quoted as saying in an email to Irwin Cotler, head of the Montreal-based Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights.
China has expressed outrage over Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], alleged by U.S. authorities to have deceived international banks into clearing transactions with Iran.
In what many analysts and diplomats believe to be retribution, China has since detained two Canadians and, on Monday, sentenced a third to death for drug smuggling after an unusual and swift retrial.
China's foreign ministry has denied there is a link.
The Globe and Mail said Wang was denied use of her phone and computer, and not allowed to contact the Canadian embassy. Chinese officials told her she was not allowed to return to Canada and put her on a flight back to South Korea, it added.
Wang's father, Wang Bingzhang, is a pro-democracy activist abducted in Vietnam in 2002 by Chinese agents before being imprisoned for life in China on charges of espionage and terrorism, the rights group Human Rights in China has said.
The Globe and Mail said Ti-Anna Wang was barred from entering China last week when she arrived at Hangzhou airport, despite having obtained a visa in August to visit her ailing jailed father.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan security forces have killed all the Somali militants who stormed an upscale Nairobi hotel compound, taking at least 21 lives and forcing hundreds of people into terrifying escapes, the government said on Wednesday.
Fifty people believed to have been in the complex remained unaccounted for on Wednesday afternoon, the Kenya Red Cross said, raising the possibility of a much higher final death toll.
The bloody bodies of five attackers were broadcast across social media as President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the end of a 20-hour overnight siege that echoed a 2013 assault that killed 67 people in the Westgate shopping center in the same district.
(Graphic showing the location and time of the Kenya militant attack at 14 Riverside drive: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ALAXKg)
Somali group al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate fighting to impose strict Islamic law, said they carried out the attack in revenge for U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
""The security operation ... is over and all the terrorists eliminated,"" Kenyatta said in a televised national address, looking drained and grave.
Kenyatta did not specify how many assailants there were, but CCTV clips showed at least five dressed in black, some sporting green grenade belts.
One militant is seen in one clip waiting outside a restaurant before blowing himself up in a cloud of debris just after 3 p.m. (1200 GMT). Another explosion near the entrance gate, possibly a grenade, ignites three cars before four men stroll by firing assault rifles and split into two groups. 
One group entered a nearby office building, where they left a grenade in the lobby, a private security professional present during the attack told Reuters. Then they shot into elevators and offices as they searched for victims up to the sixth floor.
The other group raked the restaurant with gunfire. Eventually the militants holed up on or near the top floor of the hotel, taking potshots at those fleeing, he said. 
BLOODSTAINED TABLES
Sixteen Kenyans - including a policeman - an American 9/11 survivor, and a British development worker were among the casualties, police chief Joseph Boinnet said. Three more victims were of African origin but their nationality was unknown, he added.
Some victims had been dining in the Secret Garden restaurant and lay slumped at bloodstained tables, video seen by Reuters showed. 
In its two-page statement claiming responsibility, al Shabaab said: ""This operation ... (was) a response to the witless remarks of U.S. president, Donald Trump, and his declaration.""
Asked about the group's claim, a White House National Security Council spokesman said in a statement: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism.""
Air strikes against the group have intensified under Trump, but Tuesday's attack showed that the insurgents retain the ability to strike outside Somalia's borders. 
Neighboring Kenya, a hub for multinationals and the United Nations, became a frequent target for al Shabaab after Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to try to create a buffer zone along its long, porous border.
The dusitD2 complex is home to offices of international companies including Colgate Palmolive (N:CL),  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), Dow Chemical (N:DWDP) ad SAP (DE:SAPG), as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of Thai group  Dusit Thani  (BK:DTC).
Hiram Macharia, marketing executive at LG Electronics, said he grabbed a fire extinguisher and headed downstairs after the first blast.
""Then we saw two of the attackers firing at the elevators and we turned back,"" he told Reuters outside the hotel. 
""They were firing twice at each of the elevator doors and the two staircase doors on each floor as they walked up the building. One of them fired at our office doors, entered slightly and then moved on."" 
Macharia and some colleagues hid under desks, but one person ran to the roof and was shot dead there, he added.
WESTGATE MISTAKES AVOIDED
Security forces appeared to have avoided some of the mistakes made during the 2013 attack, when police and soldiers shot at each other, then soldiers looted the Westgate mall. 
One private security worker at the scene said many of the explosions, especially those followed by a short burst of gunfire, were Kenyan special forces using small charges to blow open locked doors and clear rooms. 
About a dozen armed foreigners of various nationalities were also there, he said, including embassy staff and private security advisers trying to rescue clients. 
Mamadou Dia was on a business trip from Paris for STP Consultants when he ended up huddled in a room with Chinese and Canadian hotel guests and a waiter.
""They told us by text that the police knew we were in that room and that they would come, and one and a half hours later, the police came to evacuate us,"" he said. 
As armed officers escorted them out, the attackers shot at them ""like snipers,"" he said, adding that police fired back.
At nearby Chiromo morgue, the family of a 35-year-old man collapsed upon hearing a body had arrived with his identification papers. 

""He is gone, he is gone,"" the father repeated into his phone as his mother wrapped a shawl around herself and wept.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 08:04PM ET</span>",U.S. considering allowing lawsuits over Cuba-confiscated properties,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering allowing a law that has been suspended since its creation in 1996 to go into effect, allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies and individuals over property confiscated from them by the Cuban government.
The so-called Title III rule forms part of the Helms-Burton Act, which codified all U.S. sanctions against Cuba into law 23 years ago. It has been waived by every president ever since, Democrats and Republicans alike, due to opposition from the international community and fears it could create chaos in the U.S. court system, analysts say.
However, the administration of President Donald Trump on Wednesday suspended it for just 45 days rather than the customary six months and said it would take a fresh look at allowing it to go into effect.
""This extension will permit us to conduct a careful review of the right to bring action under Title III in light of the national interests of the United States and efforts to expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba,"" the State Department said in a statement.
""We encourage any person doing business in Cuba to reconsider whether they are trafficking in confiscated property and abetting this dictatorship.""
If Title III went into effect, it would likely dash foreign investment that Cuba has been seeking to drum up to support its beleaguered state-dominated economy.
In the first official Cuban response to the news, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez wrote on Twitter that the decision to suspend Title III for just 45 days was ""political blackmail"" and a ""brutal attack against international law.""
U.S.-Cuban relations have nosedived since Trump became president, partially rolling back the detente initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama and reverting to Cold War rhetoric, albeit maintaining re-established diplomatic relations.
Analysts say changes to the administration over the last year, including the appointment of Cuba hardliners to top posts, suggest the Trump government could further toughen its stance on Cuba.
John Bolton, who became Trump's national security adviser last April, called Cuba and its top allies Venezuela and Nicaragua a ""troika of tyranny"" in November.
The right to sue over property confiscated by the Cuban government after the 1959 revolution is one of the long-standing claims of older generations of Cuban-Americans.
""I look forward to continuing to work with the administration to ensure that ... the victims receive the justice which is long overdue,"" said Florida Representative Mario Diaz-Balart on Twitter.
However, analysts said such a move could backfire.
""It would cause an enormous legal mess, anger U.S. allies in Europe and Latin America, and probably result in a World Trade Organization case against the U.S.,"" said William Leogrande, a professor of government at American University.
The State Department estimated in the past that allowing Title III to go into effect could result in 200,000 or more lawsuits being filed, he said. 
Even U.S. businesses could get caught in the crossfire, said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University.
U.S. airlines and cruise companies started operating in Cuba following Obama's detente, paying fees to Havana's airport and port, properties that may have been confiscated.
""Legitimate property claims need to be resolved, but in the context of a bilateral negotiation,"" said Bustamante. ""Those backing the enforcement of Title III seem most intent on sowing havoc rather than achieving a positive good.""

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>","U.S. sees Palestinian state on most of West Bank, some of East Jerusalem: Israeli TV","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli television said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan would propose a Palestinian state on as much as 90 percent of the occupied West Bank, with a capital in East Jerusalem - but not including its holy sites.
The White House, which has kept details of the plan under wraps and said its release could still be months away, dismissed the report by Israel's Reshet 13 TV as inaccurate speculation.
Citing what it said was a source briefed by the Americans, the television report said the plan would entail Israel annexing Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank while isolated settlements would either be evacuated or their construction halted.
Trump wants the proposed Israeli moves to be supplemented by territorial swaps with the Palestinians, and for East Jerusalem's walled Old City - site of major Jewish, Muslim and Christian shrines - to be under Israeli sovereignty but with the joint management of the Palestinians and Jordan, the report said.
It said ""most Arab neighborhoods"" in East Jerusalem would be under Palestinian sovereignty as a future capital.
Israel calls all of Jerusalem its ""eternal and undivided capital"", a status not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, including the Al Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City, as capital of a future state. 
The report made no mention of the fate of Palestinian refugees, another core dispute in the decades-old conflict, or of how the Gaza Strip, which is under the control of Hamas Islamists opposed to peace with Israel, might fit into the plan.
Israeli and Palestinian officials did not immediately respond to the Reshet 13 report.
Trump's Middle East peace envoy Jason Greenblatt, a main architect of the plan along with the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said in a message on Twitter the report ""is not accurate."" He did not specify, however, what in the report was incorrect.
""Speculation about the content of the plan is not helpful Very few people on the planet know what is in it ... for now,"" Greenblatt wrote. ""Peddling false, distorted or biased stories to the media is irresponsible & harmful to the process.""
In separate remarks to reporters, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, predicted that the Trump plan would not be released before an Israeli election on April 9.
Opinion polls predict an easy win that would secure a fifth term for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a rightist whose U.S.-sponsored peace talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stalled in 2014.
""From what we understand, it will not be presented before the election,"" Danon said. ""It's a smart decision because we don’t want it to become the issue of the elections.”

BEIRUT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bomb attack claimed by Islamic State killed two U.S. troops and two civilians working for the U.S. military in northern Syria on Wednesday, weeks after President Donald Trump said the group had been defeated there and that he would pull out all American forces.
The attack in Manbij appeared to be the deadliest on U.S. forces in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015. The town is controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. 
The U.S. military confirmed four Americans were killed and said three U.S. troops were wounded in the explosion, which an Islamic State-affiliated site said was the work of a suicide bomber. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said 19 people had been killed in all, including four Americans. 
It was unclear what impact the blast might have on Trump's calculus after he confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision last month to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring Islamic State had been defeated there.
No experts believe Islamic State has been defeated, despite the group having lost almost all of the territory it held in 2014 and 2015 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq and declaring a ""caliphate.""
Trump's Dec. 19 announcement was one of the reasons his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, resigned. It stunned allies and raised fears of a long-threatened Turkish military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria.
Hours after the blast, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he and Trump condemned the attack. He simultaneously restated U.S. plans to withdraw while also saying Washington would never allow Islamic State to re-establish itself - something experts say it will try to do following a U.S. pullout.
""As we begin to bring our troops home, the American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families, and our nation, we will never allow the remnants of ISIS to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate,"" Pence said.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, often an ally for Trump, said he believed Islamic State had been emboldened by the president's decision to pull out of Syria and asked him to ""look long and hard"" at what he wants to do there.
""My concern about the statements made by President Trump is that you've set in motion enthusiasm by the enemy we're fighting,"" Graham said during a congressional hearing.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he did not believe the attack would have an impact on the U.S. decision to withdraw from Syria ""because I saw honorable Trump's determination on this point"". 
How, and how quickly, U.S. forces leave has caused ructions in northern Syria, with both Turkey and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad ready to fill the vacuum. 
The U.S.-backed YPG militia that is allied to the fighters holding Manbij last month invited Assad into the area around the town to forestall a potential Turkish assault. Syrian army troops entered the area soon after. 
A witness in Manbij said Wednesday's attack had targeted a restaurant where U.S. personnel were meeting members of the militia backed by Washington. The U.S. military's Central Command said in a statement that the attack happened ""while conducting a local engagement in Manbij.""
An Islamic State statement later said a Syrian fighter had detonated his explosive vest on a foreign patrol in Manbij. 
Two witnesses described the blast to Reuters.
""An explosion hit near a restaurant, targeting the Americans, and there were some forces from the Manbij Military Council with them,"" one said. 
The council militia has controlled the town since U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces took it from Islamic State in 2016. Manbij is near areas held by Russian-backed Syrian government forces and by anti-Assad fighters backed by Turkey.
The council said in a statement that women and children were among civilians killed and offered condolences for the ""hero American soldiers"" who died. 
One of the witnesses said there was a ""heavy"" presence of military aircraft over Manbij following the blast.
At the Pentagon, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan offered his condolences to the families.
Syria's civil war has killed half a million people, forced more than half the country's pre-war population from their homes and dragged in global and regional powers. Assad controls most of the country.

The violence compounds an already dire security situation in the desert region used by jihadist groups to launch attacks in Mali and across West Africa.
The identity of the assailants was unknown, but disputes between the nomadic Tuareg and herder Fulani ethnic groups have killed several hundred and displaced thousands over the past year.
Menaka town mayor Nanout Kotia told Reuters 34 Tuareg were killed in two nearby villages on Tuesday.
""Armed men riding several motorbikes, as is their custom, encircled these villages and shot at the people. The death toll is high,"" Kotia said by telephone.
The attack follows the killing of more than 40 Tuareg civilians in the same area in mid-December and the death of 15 Fulani civilians in Mali's central Mopti region in the same month.
Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012, prompting French forces to intervene to push them back the following year.
They have since regained a foothold in the north and center, tapping into ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.

SAN SALVADOR/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - At least 150 Salvadoran migrants departed in a group for the United States on Wednesday, the latest in a string of such 'caravans' that U.S. President Donald Trump has used to build his case for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
The group, organized through social media, is following in the wake of a larger caravan that departed from Honduras this week.
On Wednesday morning, between 900 and 1,000 Hondurans gathered at the country's border with Guatemala, waiting to cross en-route to the United States, local police chief Jorge Rodriguez told Reuters.
Several hundred Honduran migrants already entered Guatemala on Tuesday, according to activists traveling with them.
Caravans from Central America have inflamed the debate over U.S. immigration policy, with Trump pointing at the migrants to try to win backing for his border security plan.
The U.S. government has been partially shut down for over three weeks as Democrats resist Trump's demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion to fund a border wall.
In El Salvador, Jose Sorto, 30, said violence drove him to leave his home. Three years ago, he said, he was attacked by the Barrio 18 gang.
""I joined the caravan because here you can't live in peace. I have to run away and hide every day,"" said Sorto, who is unemployed and lives in the town of Ilobasco, about 56 kilometers (35 miles) northeast of the capital.
In the United States, he said, he hopes to ""live quietly and work to buy a house for my mom.""
Walking through the streets carrying backpacks and water bottles, the migrants were escorted by immigration authorities and the police.
El Salvador is grappling with a wave of crime and violence. In 2018, the country's murder rate stood at 50.3 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest levels in the world, according to the United Nations.

The Salvadoran government estimates that some 2,700 people have left the country through half a dozen caravans over the past year. About 600 have returned voluntarily, and three have died, according to government figures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Islamic State has been defeated in Syria, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, hours after Americans were killed in a northern Syria bomb attack claimed by the militant group.
Pence did not mention the attack in his address to 184 chiefs of U.S. diplomatic missions who gather annually in Washington from around the world to discuss foreign policy strategy. 
""The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated,"" Pence told the U.S. ambassadors and other senior American diplomats, referring to Islamic State.
In separate statements later, both the White House and Pence condemned the attack and expressed sympathy for the deaths of the U.S. personnel.
The Pentagon said two U.S. servicemembers, a Department of Defense civilian employee and one contractor working for the military were killed and three servicemembers were injured in the blast in the northern Syria town of Manbij. 
An Islamic State-affiliated website said the attack was the work of a suicide bomber. 
Trump made a surprise announcement on Dec. 19 that he would withdraw 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria after concluding that Islamic State had been defeated there. His decision led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who cited policy differences with the president for his departure. 
LACK OF PROGRESS
Despite talks of a second leaders' summit between Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, Pence acknowledged that efforts to convince Pyonyang to give up its nuclear arsenal had not made headway.
""While the president is promising dialogue with Chairman Kim we still await concrete steps by North Korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region,"" he said.
The vice president also criticized China's ""unfair"" trade practices and loans to developing countries that pushed up their debt levels as it tries to gain greater influence in the world.
""The truth is that too often in recent years China has chosen a path that disregards the laws and norms that have kept the world state prosperous for more than half a century,"" he said. ""The days of the United States looking the other way are over,"" he added.
Pence said the administration's foreign policy was based on Trump's ""America First"" agenda. ""No longer will the United States government pursue grandiose, unrealistic notions at the expense of American people,"" he said.
He acknowledged that Trump's foreign policy was ""different from what the world has come to expect"" and that the United States faced different threats than during the Cold War.

""Today we are not up against one super power but several great powers competing with us for preeminence across the world,"" he said, saying the United States faced a ""wolf pack"" of rogue states including Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 03:14PM ET</span>",Thousands march in Belgrade in anti-government protest,"By Aleksandar Vasovic
BELGRADE (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters marching in Belgrade to mark the anniversary of the assassination of a Kosovo Serb leader accused the authorities on Wednesday of covering up for the perpetrators of the unsolved killing.
The march, the seventh such anti-government protest since December 8, took place on the eve of a visit by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, an event expected to boost the popularity of President Aleksandar Vucic, who also heads the ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS).
Protesters brought together by the Alliance for Serbia, a loose grouping of 30 opposition parties and organizations, marched in silence in the evening in tribute to Oliver Ivanovic, gunned down a year ago in the Kosovo town of Mitrovica. 
""This is not only about Oliver, who was a man of peace, this protest is also about the climate of fear-mongering, this is because of a regime that is intimidating its own citizens,"" said Nenad Nikolic, a 23-year-old student. 
Ivanovic, 64, was shot dead on Jan. 16 as he arrived at his party office in Mitrovica, a town bitterly split between Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians and minority nationalist Serbs, who dominate the northern region surrounding Mitrovica.
He had been facing retrial over killings of ethnic Albanians during Kosovo’s 1998-99 guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule. Kosovo gained independence from Serbia in 2008 and Ivanovic subsequently became known as a relative moderate for advocating dialogue and compromise with Kosovo Albanians.
Ivanovic also became one of the chief interlocutors for NATO, U.N. and EU officials based in Kosovo to help steer it toward stable democracy and rule of law. 
""This is a symbolic day because we are not only marking the slaying of a great man, we are marking one year of a cover-up by the state and Pristina as well,"" Stana Ilic, 59, said. 
""I hope this murder will be resolved once Vucic and his clique are replaced,"" she said.
Three Serbs were arrested in connection with the killing in November 2018 when a special police unit sent by the Kosovo Albanian government in Pristina carried out a raid in the Serb-dominated north side of Mitrovica. They have yet to be charged.
On Wednesday protesters marched toward the biggest Orthodox church in Serbia, the Saint Sava Church, a site which Putin will visit. Dozens of thousands of SNS supporters are expected to come to the church on Thursday to greet the Russian leader.
Since he took power in 2012, Vucic has been performing a delicate balancing act between Serbia's goal to join the European Union and maintaining close ties with Orthodox Russia. 
Vucic and his coalition have a majority of 160 deputies in the 250 seat parliament, but protests could shake their popularity. 

""Dissatisfaction is there, it is a question of time if there is going to be more sustained risk to the government,"" Florian Bieber, Balkans expert at the University of Graz, told Reuters.

The travel bans and asset freezes, which will also hit two other Russians and five Syrians, are set to be approved by EU foreign ministers at their regular monthly meeting in Brussels on Monday.
Diplomats said Britain put forward the names of two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, charging that they attempted to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal's front door in the English city of Salisbury last March.
The men have denied any involvement in the attack.
Those targeted are the first names to be added to a new EU mechanism to punish chemical weapons attacks using banned munitions, regardless of their nationality.
Banned two decades ago under an international treaty, the rising use of nerve agents has alarmed Western governments, with recent cases including the attempted murder of Russian double agent Skripal.
Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russia's military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on March 4 last year.

The two men set to be sanctioned, who London says are Russian military intelligence officers, stand accused by Britain of flying to England and trying to murder Skripal. The men say they were innocent tourists who had visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday rejected a Russian offer to save a landmark treaty that keeps nuclear missiles out of Europe because it could not be properly verified, setting the stage for Washington to withdraw from the pact next month.
After a meeting in Geneva between Russian and U.S. officials, U.S. Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson said Moscow was refusing to allow proper inspection of a new Russian missile system that Washington says breaks the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).
The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.
The treaty bans land-based missiles with a range between 500 kms and 5,500 kms (300-3400 miles).
""We weren't able to break any new ground yesterday with Russia,"" Thompson said of the Jan. 15 meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. 
""Based on yesterday's discussions and corresponding rhetoric today, we see no indication that Russia would choose compliance,"" Thompson told reporters.
SHORT NOTICE
The United States and its NATO allies want Russia to destroy its 9M729 nuclear-capable cruise missile system, which Washington says could allow Russia to strike Europe at short notice, and comply with the INF.
Without a deal, a U.S. withdrawal over six months will start from Feb. 2. 
""Russia must come back into compliance,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters after a meeting at NATO in which Thompson briefed allies.
But he said the alliance now needed to be prepared for the collapse of the INF treaty and that he had asked military authorities to look into the consequences, although he declined to go into details.
European allies are worried about the deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe, as happened in the 1980s, while being caught up in nuclear competition between Moscow and Washington.
""This is part of a pattern where Russia is investing in, modernizing, exercising and testing nuclear weapons,"" Stoltenberg told Reuters. ""I think the whole idea is for Russia to try to be able to reestablish a sphere of influence where they can try to intimidate and control some of their neighbors.""
Russia denies any such strategy and accuses U.S. President Donald Trump of using Moscow as a pretext to quit the INF.
Earlier on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was ready to save the pact and the United States had not properly considered Moscow's proposals and prevent a new arms race in Europe.
But Thompson said the Russian side only offered a look at the cruise missile system, a so-called static display, which she said would not verify the true range of its warheads.
Moscow says the range puts them outside the treaty and the distance they can fly is not as long as Washington alleges, meaning Moscow is fully compliant with the INF.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:32PM ET</span>",Iran says it will be ready for new satellite launch in a few months,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran will be ready for a new satellite launch in a few months' time after a failed attempt this week, President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday, ignoring U.S. and European warnings to avoid such activity.
Western officials say the missile technology used in such launches could be applied to delivering a nuclear weapon.
Iran's bid to send a satellite, named Payam, into orbit failed on Tuesday as its launching rocket did not reach adequate speed in its third stage. 
Rouhani was quoted by state media as saying, however, that Iran had ""achieved great success in building satellites and launching them. That means we are on the right track.
""The remaining problems are minor, will be resolved in a few months, and we will soon be ready for a new launch,"" he said.
The United States warned Iran this month against undertaking three planned rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology.
France's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday condemned the abortive launch and urged Iran to cease ballistic missile tests, which Paris sees as of potential use for nuclear arms.
""The Iranian ballistic program is a source of concern for the international community and France,"" ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement.
""We call on Iran not to proceed with new ballistic missile tests designed to be able to carry nuclear weapons, including space launchers, and urge Iran to respect its obligations under all U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" von der Muhll said.
Reacting to the French comments, the Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman said Iran’s satellite capabilities did not breach UN resolutions or any other international conventions since they ""did not have a military nature.""
""The Islamic Republic will choose a path that serves the nation’s long term and strategic interests, and will not sacrifice the scientific development of the country for baseless and fabricated concerns of foreign countries,"" Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by IRNA.
Under the U.N. resolution enshrining Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, Tehran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles suitable for carrying nuclear weapons.
Some states say this phrasing does not make it an obligatory commitment. Iran has repeatedly said the ballistic missiles it is developing are purely defensive in purpose and not designed to carry nuclear warheads.

The nuclear deal is now at risk after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it, in part because it did not cover Iran's ballistic missile program, and reimposed tough sanctions on Tehran.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","Brazil, Argentina step up pressure on Venezuela's Maduro","By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and Argentina's President Mauricio Macri said after their first meeting on Wednesday that they agreed on opposing Venezuela's authoritarian government, with Macri calling Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a ""dictator.""
They also agreed to continue integrating their economies by ""perfecting"" the South American trade bloc Mercosur and pressing ahead with negotiations that are already underway, such as an almost completed free-trade accord with the European Union.
Bolsonaro's commitment to Mercosur contrasted with his criticism of the customs union during his election campaign, when he said it had become a leftist political forum and not a tool to boost trade.
But since he took office on Jan. 1, Mercosur's two largest members are now working in tandem on conservative agendas of free-market, business-friendly reforms and the strengthening of democracy in the region.
Bolsonaro and Macri agree on joining the United States in ramping up pressure for democratic change in Venezuela, whose leftist government they consider illegitimate.
""Our cooperation with Argentina on the Venezuelan question it the clearest example of a convergence of positions and shared values,"" Bolsonaro said after meeting with Macri.
Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said the only legally constituted power in Venezuela was the opposition-run Congress, whose leader the Trump administration is considering recognizing as the country's legitimate president.
Macri and Bolsonaro ""agree we want to defend freedom and the recovery of democracy in Venezuela,"" Faurie told reporters.
Argentina and Brazil also signed a new extradition treaty to increase their cooperation in fighting organized crime, drug trafficking, corruption and money laundering.
In a joint statement, the presidents vowed to review Mercosur's common external tariff, improve access to markets and move forward with trade facilitation and regulatory convergence.
Brazil is Argentina's largest trade partner and Argentina is the main destination for Brazilian manufactured goods. But trade often took a back seat during leftist governments in both countries during the last decade and a half.
There has been a big drop in trade flows in recent years, when Argentina exported less to Brazil and Mercosur, as a whole, became less important to Brazil as a percentage of its global trade, dropping to 8.7 percent last year from 10.8 in 2011. 
Bolsonaro would like to see more flexible rules allowing Brazil to negotiate bilateral agreements outside the bloc. His economy minister Paulo Guedes has said Mercosur restricts Brazil too much and would not be a priority.
Wednesday's presidential meeting showed Mercosur is still high on Brazil's agenda. 
""Brazil will be a strong ally in building an integrated region,"" Bolsonaro said. ""We are confident Mercosur can be modernized.""
This could happen with two presidents who want to revamp the trade block, said Oliver Stuenkel, assistant professor of International Relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo.

""There is an opportunity because now we have two governments that agree it has not delivered and there is a need to re-energize Mercosur or whatever takes its place,"" Stuenkel said.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:22PM ET</span>",Venezuela children left behind as parents flee to find work abroad,"By Shaylim Castro
CARACAS (Reuters) - Yusneiker and Anthonella have been living with their grandmother since their father left Venezuela and its collapsing economy last year for Peru, to try and earn enough to feed them. Two years earlier, their mother fled for the Dominican Republic for the same reason.
Yusneiker, 12, and Anthonella, 8, are eating better thanks to hard currency remittances from their parents, according to their grandmother Aura Orozco, who is grateful for the dollars that offer a reprieve from Venezuela's annual inflation of nearly 2 million percent. 
Still, she said, they miss their parents.
When they fall sick, they clamor for their mother. Though Yusneiker has adapted, Anthonella's grades have slipped. The dark-eyed, curly-haired girl has clammed up and often answers her grandmother by simply nodding or shaking her head.
""To this day, she will lay down and if you ask her 'what is wrong?' she will say 'I miss my mommy,'"" said Orozco, 48, in her home in the hillside Caracas slum of Cota 905.
Some 3 million Venezuelans have migrated in three years, putting a growing strain on the country's children as more parents are forced into the heart-wrenching decision to leave.
There is no official data on the phenomenon from the government of President Nicolas Maduro, which disputes the idea that there is an exodus, saying international aid agencies are inflating figures to give the administration a black eye. Despite this official skepticism, Maduro has touted a program to help migrants return.
Childhood hunger, decrepit schools and shortages of medicine and vaccinations already were problems amid the collapse of an economy once renowned for abundant oil wealth. With more parents migrating, experts interviewed by Reuters said growing problems facing Venezuelan children now include slumping school performance and malnutrition of newborns separated from would-be nursing mothers.
""These are lose-lose decisions for the parents - do I lose more by not being able to cover basic needs in the country, or by sacrificing the relationship with my child?"" said Abel Saraiba, a psychologist with Caracas-based child advocacy group Cecodap.
Venezuelan migration, for years a middle-class phenomenon that involved air travel, is now dominated by working-class citizens who take long bus rides or walk along dangerous paths that are unsuitable for children. 
Many also know they face challenging economic circumstances and want to be free to work all-day shifts to send more money home.
Cecodap said problems associated with children left behind by emigrating parents comprised its third most common request for help in 2018, up from fifth place in 2017.
Catholic organization Faith and Happiness, which runs schools in poor neighborhoods, said at least 5 percent of students had seen their parents emigrate as of the start of 2019. 
MATERIAL BENEFITS
Children often gain material benefits from their parents' migration, because sending hard currency to relatives provides greater access to food and medicine and even the occasional gift. Yusneiker's grandmother was recently able to surprise him with a new pair of sneakers. 
Parents say this is little consolation for breaking up a family.
""Even though my kids are older, it still hurts. I miss them so much,"" said Omaira Martinez, who left her 17-year-old and 21-year-old children with their grandmother when she moved to Chile six months ago, where she now works washing dishes. ""The first few months were hard. I cried a lot.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles media inquiries for the government, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Maduro has warned migrants that they face xenophobia and exploitation in other countries, and has launched a repatriation effort called ""Return to the Homeland"" that he says has helped some 12,000 unhappy migrants return home.
Often parents are unable to return quickly despite having promised to do so.
When Angymar Jimenez, 27, left for Ecuador to work as a manicurist, she planned to be back in several months. Two years later, her two children Andrew, 5, and Ailin, 10, are still in the care of their grandmother, Iris Olivo.
""(Ailin) at first would say that her mom was coming to get her, she would say goodbye to her friends because she thought she was leaving,"" said Olivo. ""Eventually she realized that wasn't happening.""
In extreme cases, migration of a nursing mother can lead to illness and malnutrition.
One-year-old Leanny Santander (MC:SAN) in the western Falcon state has been suffering from diarrhea and vomiting since her mother moved to Colombia in search of work and stopped breastfeeding her, said her grandmother, Nelida Santander.
Santander said doctors told her Leanny's health problems, which now include bronchitis, resulted from the early end of breast-feeding.
""I prefer for my granddaughter to be here with me - if her mother took her over there it would be worse,"" said Santander, 50. ""Here she is sick, but at least I can attend to her.""
The decision to migrate is often made quickly, which means parents are likely to leave children with relatives without giving them custody, putting children in a legal limbo.
A 2018 survey on migration issues by pollster Datanalisis found that about half the households surveyed had not legally placed children in a guardian's care. That complicates signing up for school, where the presence of both parents is legally required.
The situation puts further pressure on kids to grow up early, sometimes to comfort their own anguished parents.

""I speak to her every day,"" said Yusneiker of his mother in the Dominican Republic. ""I tell her I miss her, that she should not worry, and that I know she has not abandoned me.""

BENALMADENA, Spain (Reuters) - In the bowling clubs, bars and real estate agencies of Spain's southern coast, a long-established expatriate population is turning frugal as Britons fret about their future.
""There's hardly anybody out, and they're not spending a lot,"" said bar owner Kevin Sharp on Tuesday night, minutes after lawmakers in London snubbed Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal to leave his birth country's departure from the EU in disarray.
""The older generation is more worried. I've got a top-of-the-range beer for three euros, but they're looking at the one-euro bar over the road,"" said 50-year-old Sharp, originally from Aberdeen.
Around 300,000 Britons live in Spain, many of them retirees lured by the Mediterranean climate and calm pace of life, and Sharp's establishment in Benalmadena is a short drive down the coast from one of their heartlands, Torremolinos.
The Spanish government has been at pains to reassure them that their rights in Spain will be protected after Brexit.
But a sharp depreciation of the pound since the June 2016 Brexit referendum and worries about whether they can continue to enjoy healthcare and regular pension increases are taking their toll.
Britons now ""might share a toastie instead of having one each,"" said Sue Aspey, owner of the Wigan Bar on the beach in Benalmadena. 
Its menu includes Lancashire lamb hotpot and traditional British sweet dish jam roly-poly, which could be subject to import tariffs or higher transport costs after Britain leaves the bloc.
""If things are more expensive for us to buy and people on the terrace only have the same amount of money in their pockets, we'd have to absorb that increase,"" she said.
RELOCATION, RELOCATION
Britons in Spain are putting off bigger investments too.
Kevin Welch's real estate company usually gets lots of enquiries in the run-up to Christmas from British people who want to move to Spain's sunny southern coast. But not this year.
""There wasn't that same amount of traffic coming through, saying Joe Bloggs is interested in x, y and z,"" said Welch, originally from Liverpool and now living in Benalmadena.
Data from the agency that tracks sales of Spanish property shows Britons still buy far more than any other foreign nationality, but they have gone from 22 percent of all foreign buyers in the first quarter of 2016 to 16 percent in the third quarter of 2018.
""People are holding out,"" Welch said. ""Some people are still looking to buy, but you know that two or three years ago they could have got a lot more for their buck.""
Holiday home buyers and wealthy people have been affected less, but those looking to relocate away from the busy coast have been put off by factors including uncertainty about future tax arrangements and even ease of travel, said Graham Ducker, who directs two real estate agencies in Malaga province.
Ducker says he has seen a drop of more than 50 percent in demand from Britons, who on average want to pay around 15 percent less than they did before the referendum.

""The taxes paid by non Europeans on house sales is also a lot higher than by EU citizens and so that may also change,"" Ducker said. ""There are many reasons for British buyers and sellers to be worried in the case of a hard Brexit.""

Branded by prosecutors as ""maniacal"" about managing her money, the woman named only as Betty W., won a reprieve from the Ghent appeal court from having to serve six months in prison.

The judges also increased the amount she must repay to the state by some 50 percent to 3.7 million euros to take account of frauds which prosecutors said dated back 40 years as W. concealed her wealth in Panama and elsewhere. The scam came to light through a leak of records at a Swiss bank.

Talks between the Taliban and American officials have hit a roadblock after the hardline Islamic militants canceled the fourth round of peace talks last week and rejected the involvement of the Afghan government in the dialogue.
On Tuesday, the Taliban threatened to pull out of the peace process with the United States if they diverted from the issue of foreign force withdrawal from Afghanistan, a key demand of the insurgents to end the 17-year war.
The Taliban's warning came hours after Zalmay Khalilzad landed in Afghanistan after meeting officials from India, China and the United Arab Emirates to discuss the peace process. 
""If the Taliban want to talk, we can talk. If they want to fight, we can fight,"" Khalilzad told journalists in Kabul.
The White House has said President Donald Trump had not issued orders to the Pentagon to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, but the White House has not denied reports that the United States plans to pull out some of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed.[
Khalilzad said: ""We hope that they (Taliban) want to make peace. But if they do not choose to come to the table, if they choose to continue fighting, the United States will stand with the Afghan people and the Afghan government and support them.""
Speaking about the next date for a meeting with the Taliban, he said: ""We are hopeful it will happen very soon. That's what we're working towards.""
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born U.S. diplomat, was appointed last year to lead peace talks between the United States, the Taliban and the Afghan government. In a news briefing last year he said a peace deal could be reached before April 2019.
But differences over the agenda and persistent fighting between the warring sides have deepened mistrust.
The insurgents, fighting to expel foreign forces and defeat the Western-backed Afghan government, want a timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The United States wants the Taliban to declare a ceasefire and include the Afghan government in the talks.
""What we want is to see this conflict end through negotiation, to continue our partnership with Afghanistan and to ensure no terrorist threatens either of us,"" Khalilzad told reporters. 

Diplomats and Afghan government officials in Kabul said the security situation could worsen if both sides fail to hold talks in January.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>",Romanian top court's wiretap ruling puts graft trials at risk,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - A Romanian Constitutional Court ruling on Wednesday regarding wiretap evidence threatens to put an end to ongoing investigations including for high-profile corruption cases.
In a case brought by the ruling Social Democrats, the court ruled that cooperation protocols signed by prosecuting units with the intelligence agency SRI placed the two institutions in a constitutional conflict with parliament. 
The SRI had been collecting wiretap evidence and other types of proof on behalf of prosecutors based on court warrants - as they were legally mandated to assist with investigations - but the party's case partly hinged on the protocols not being made public.
The Social Democrats have argued that by signing the protocols, prosecutors gave SRI powers that could only be granted by the legislature.
Wednesday's ruling means that such evidence could now be struck down from ongoing investigations and trials, the latest blow dealt to the fight against corruption and the judiciary since the Social Democrats came into power two years ago.
The court ruling would have no impact on cases already tried and sentenced.
Anti-corruption prosecutors have convicted thousands of public officials, including lawmakers and ministers and their investigations have exposed conflicts of interest, fraud and the award of state contracts in exchange for bribes.
Among those convicted is Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea. He has a two-year suspended jail sentence in a vote-rigging case. He has also been sentenced to 3-1/2 years in jail in a separate abuse of office case, and his appeal is ongoing. 
He is also under investigation on suspicion of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded. The case has yet to go to trial. Dragnea denies all the charges.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.
Last year the European Commission said that proposed changes to the judicial system and criminal code signaled a reversal of a decade of democratic and market reforms.
The European Parliament also passed a non-binding resolution urging a greater fight against corruption, condemning police brutality during anti-graft protests and demanding an end to what it called the erosion of the rule of law.

An Ifop poll published on Wednesday showed Macron's centrist movement with 23 percent of voting intentions compared to 18 percent in the last poll in early December while Le Pen's Rassemblement National (National Rally, or RN) -- formerly the National Front -- fell to 21 percent from 24 percent previously.
It is the first time Macron's Republique en Marche (Republic On the Move) party has come ahead of the RN since late October, when Le Pen jumped ahead of Macron for the first time.
A number of other polls have shown a rebound in Macron's popularity in the last few weeks, in a sign parts of the public approve of the harder stance he has taken against ""yellow-vest"" protesters after riots in Paris and other French cities. 
Macron decried the violence of a ""hateful mob"" in his New Year address, while his government has branded the protesters agitators.
On Sunday, Le Pen launched her campaign for the May 26 election with an appeal to the ""yellow vest"" movement that has rattled the government.
The increase in voting intentions for Macron's party coincides with a decline for the conservative Republicans party, which has lost 5 points since August, to 10 percent. It is followed by the far-left France Insoumise at 9.5 percent.

The hard-right Debout la France is on 7.5 percent, while the Greens are seen getting 6.5 percent of the vote and the Socialists, which held the French presidency less than two years ago, trail behind at 4 percent.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>","Factbox: UK PM May's Brexit next steps: Nothing has changed, or new approach?","LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May has outlined a collaborative approach to finding a new Brexit deal after her agreement was crushed by parliament on Tuesday in the biggest defeat for a British government in modern times.
Before meetings can begin, May has to first defeat an attempt to topple her government, in the form of a no- confidence vote brought forward by opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. That vote is expected to take place around 1900 GMT and May is expected to win.
Assuming she survives, what is her new approach, and will it work?
WHAT IS MAY PROPOSING?
Immediately after Tuesday's 432 to 202 defeat was announced, May stood up in parliament and said:
""I will then hold meetings with my colleagues, our confidence and supply partner the Democratic Unionist Party, and senior parliamentarians from across the House to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the House. 
""The government will approach those meetings in a constructive spirit, but given the urgent need to make progress we must focus on ideas that are genuinely negotiable and have sufficient support in this House.""
May and her spokesman have refused to say if this means engaging directly with Corbyn. Corbyn said he had not received a phone call from May since the result of Tuesday's vote.
WHAT IS UP FOR DISCUSSION IN THE TALKS?
May has already set out the terms on which she is willing to talk. She refers to them as principles for the discussion, opponents call them ""red lines"". 
She has committed to:
1) Deliver a clear, smooth and orderly Brexit
This demonstrates May's preference for leaving the EU with a deal, despite some in her party wanting to leave without a deal. 
But it does not rule out leaving without a deal, despite a majority in parliament having expressed their view that this option should be taken off the table.
May has stressed that she does not want to delay Brexit, although she has not explicitly ruled that possibility out since Tuesday's vote. On Wednesday, she said the EU would only entertain any delay if there were a clear new plan.
She has committed to make a statement on her new approach by Jan. 21 at the latest. 
2) Protecting the union between the United Kingdom's four parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
This ambition is largely uncontroversial in parliament but there is huge disagreement on the means of achieving it. 
May has agreed to an insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. This approach has cost her the support of the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government and a large cohort of euroskeptic lawmakers in her own party.
Scottish lawmakers have also complained their interests have not been given enough prominence by the government. 
3) Giving Britain control of its borders, laws, and money
This refers to May's ambition to end free movement of people with the EU, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and stop making membership payments to the EU.
This is important because ending free movement of people would appear to rule out forms of Brexit preferred by some lawmakers modeled on either membership of the single market or a deal similar to Norway's relationship with the EU.
4) Allowing Britain to have an independent trade policy
This principle is crucial because it appears to rule out Britain remaining a member of the EU customs union or, as the Labour Party leadership are demanding, a new permanent customs union with the EU. 
CAN SHE SUCCEED?
May has largely kept to the negotiating principles she has used throughout the Brexit talks, which have alienated different groups of lawmakers on different points. There is no single policy change she can make which both respects those principles and brings in enough lawmakers to win parliamentary approval.
WHAT HAS THE REACTION BEEN?
May has been criticized by opposing lawmakers for engaging with them too late in the process, a reluctance to engage with the Labour Party leadership, and for not changing the principles, or red lines, she is willing to negotiate with.
Labour leader Corbyn: ""She is only attempting to reach out now to try to keep her failed process and deal alive after it has been so roundly rejected by parliament on behalf of the people of this country.""
Parliament's Brexit committee has called on May to hold a series of votes on different Brexit options to see which, if any has the support of a majority in parliament.
Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats who have 11 seats in parliament, said: ""She shouldn’t even bother lifting the telephone to opposition parties unless she is willing to rule out categorically a no-deal Brexit and unless she is willing to enter into a constructive conversation about a people’s vote.""
The leader of the Scottish National Party's 35 lawmakers in parliament, Ian Blackford, said: ""The EU will not renegotiate. The Prime Minister has no answer. She has failed.""
Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP which has 10 seats in parliament and supports May's government but not her Brexit deal said: ""Reassurances, whether in the form of letters or warm words, will not be enough. The Prime Minister must now go back to the European Union and seek fundamental change to the Withdrawal Agreement.

""We will work with the government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus.""

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Czechs mark 50 years since Jan Palach's self-immolation over crushing of Prague Spring,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs marked the 50th anniversary on Wednesday of student Jan Palach setting himself on fire in central Prague in a desperate act aimed at lifting the apathy hanging over the country in the wake of the Soviet invasion that crushed the Prague Spring of 1968.
Having seen a period of reforms to Czechoslovakia's Communist system snuffed out by the invasion five months earlier, and the widespread public demoralization that followed, the 20-year-old Palach decided to take action. 
He went to Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ) on Jan. 16, 1969, poured petrol over his head and set himself on fire. Passers-by smothered him with their coats, but the student of economics and philosophy died three days later of his burns.
Palach left a letter behind calling for the end of censorship and Soviet propaganda, and for a general strike.
""I marched back then with the students (after Palach's death),"" said Robert Gruen, 70, while visiting a commemorative open-air exhibition in Wenceslas Square. ""Today I think a man's life is too important to end it like that.""
Dozens of public events were held across the Czech Republic on Wednesday, including a concert alongside the exhibition in Wenceslas Square and the unveiling of a memorial plaque at Charles University, where Palach studied. Marches with lights were planned at several places for the evening.
Palach called himself ""Torch no. 1"" in his letter, giving the impression that he was a part of a larger group which in fact did not exist. But several others followed his example in Czechoslovakia and other eastern bloc countries. 
""People must fight against the evil they feel equal to measure up to at that moment,"" Palach said before he died in hospital on Jan. 19.
The Czechs mourned Palach, but his act failed to overturn the consolidation of power by Soviet-backed hard-liners who brought a period of repression that lasted until the end of Communist rule in 1989.
On the 20th anniversary of Palach's death in January 1989, thousands protested in the biggest anti-government demonstrations in two decades. They were violently dispersed by police, but cracks were revealed in the authoritarian system that months later was toppled in the Velvet Revolution.
""This was exactly what he wanted, that people speak out, protest, fight for their rights. After 20 years, his story reached a conclusion,"" said historian Petr Blazek.
Palach's act was modeled on the 1963 self-immolation of Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thin Quang Duc in Saigon, in protest at the government's treatment of the Buddhist community.

It was later echoed at the start of the Arab Spring revolution in Tunisia, which began after street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",Factbox: What might a no-deal Brexit look like?,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is due to leave the European Union in 10 weeks' time but it still has no clear way out of the bloc, raising the prospect of no transition period to smooth the shock for the world's fifth-biggest economy.
Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a major defeat on Tuesday when a huge majority of lawmakers -- many of them from her own Conservative Party -- rejected her Brexit plan.
Following is an outline of the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the economy: 
UK ECONOMY
The Bank of England has warned that a worst-case Brexit -- involving border delays and markets losing confidence in Britain -- could shock the economy into an 8 percent contraction within a year, worse than the impact of the global financial crisis. 
Output in a less severe but still disruptive no-deal Brexit would fall by around 3 percent.
The BoE also sees a risk in Britain's large current account deficit. Much of it is plugged by foreign money pouring into speculative assets, something that could dry up in the event of a big Brexit shock to the economy.
TRADE
Barriers to trade would be raised, at least in the short term, hurting companies on both sides of the English Channel.
British exporters would face EU import tariffs which average 5 percent but are higher for some major exports such as cars which would pay a 10 percent tariff. Britain's automotive industry employs over 800,000 people.
Manufacturers across the board are worried about border delays which would hurt their just-in-time production.
Brexit supporters say those fears are overblown because technology would ease any border delays and exports would flow freely once Britain gets a future EU free trade deal.
Deals with faster-growing nations such as the United States, India and China would be a big boost for Britain, the Brexit supporters say. But the country's budget forecasters say the benefits of such trade deals are likely to be small.
PORTS AND STOCKPILING
The government is building lorry parks along motorways and also plans to use an airport in the south of England to cope with any tail-backs at ports on the English Channel.
Academics at Imperial College say two extra minutes spent checking each vehicle at Dover and Folkestone could lead to traffic queues of 29 miles on the M20 motorway and A20 road.
Many manufacturers are stockpiling parts to keep production lines open. The British government has asked drugmakers to stockpile medicines for six weeks above normal operations.
Brexit supporters say the worries are exaggerated. They point to comments by the head of the port in Calais, in France, who said trucks would continue to move through without delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 
France has said it plans to hire hundreds of additional customs officers and create extra border control facilities.
HELP FROM THE BUDGET AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND? 
Finance minister Philip Hammond has built up a fiscal war-chest to spend more in case of a Brexit shock to the economy.
But he has also warned that, longer term, a no-deal Brexit would mean a rethink of his promise to end austerity because the economy would grow more slowly, hurting tax revenues.
Brexit supporters say leaving the EU with no deal would help the public finances because it would mean an immediate end to payments by London into the EU budget.
The BoE has warned investors not to assume that it would rush to the rescue and cut interest rates after a no-deal shock. A fall in the value of the pound would push up inflation, it says, potentially requiring higher borrowing costs.
POUND 
Given the likely economic hit, a no-deal Brexit would probably push the pound down, adding to its losses against the U.S dollar of about 13 percent since the 2016 referendum.
Under the BoE's worst-case Brexit scenario, sterling would slump 25 percent to about the same value as the U.S. dollar.
FTSE
A weaker pound could push up the share prices of many of Britain's biggest companies which do business around the world such as  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) and GSK in the FTSE 100, which makes 70 percent of its income overseas.
But there could be punishment for the more domestically focused FTSE 250 companies who make half their money at home.
BONDS 
The economic shock of a no-deal Brexit would usually spur investors to seek the safe haven of British government bonds. 

However, a no-deal Brexit would be a major blow to May and could usher in a new national election. The resurgent left-wing Labour Party has plans for big increases in public spending which would unsettle some investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - With just 10 weeks until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union, it is unclear how or even whether the divorce will take place.
The crushing defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's deal means she must now work with other parties in parliament on a new variant if she is to avoid a no-deal Brexit or the other option, a referendum on membership.
As the clock ticks down to 2300 GMT on March 29, the time and date set in law for Brexit, May has three main options: a compromise deal, a no-deal Brexit or halting Brexit altogether.
FUDGED DEAL
After her defeat, May pledged to speak to senior to parliamentarians to find a compromise, and financial markets are betting that lawmakers will cobble together a last-minute deal.
The opposition Labour Party's finance policy spokesman, John McDonnell, said Labour would support May if she agreed to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU, a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers.
With May's Conservatives deeply split, the opposition party holds great influence over the eventual outcome of Brexit. It is difficult to see how any Brexit plan can pass the House of Commons without the support of some of Labour's 256 lawmakers.
But if May moves closer to Labour's position, she risks losing the support of dozens of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers as well as the small Northern Irish party which props up her minority government.
If May is unable to forge a compromise deal, she will have to chose between calling a national election, delaying Brexit or going for a no-deal exit.
Many Conservative lawmakers would oppose fighting a national election at such a crucial juncture, especially after she lost the party its majority in a snap poll in 2017. May herself said on Wednesday an election would be ""the worst thing we could do"".
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that one way forward would be for Britain to accept closer alignment with EU regulations. EU officials say London could, for example, abandon its plan to leave the EU customs union and single market, but that is unlikely to win backing among many Conservatives.
NO-DEAL BREXIT
Despite strong opposition among a majority of British lawmakers and many businesses to leaving the EU without a deal, this remains the default option unless parliament can agree on a Brexit plan.
""It is not enough to just not like May's deal - to not have a no-deal there has to be something to replace it with, otherwise we leave without a deal,"" said one senior British lawmaker.
No-deal means there would be no transition so the exit would be abrupt, the nightmare scenario for international businesses and the dream of hard Brexiteers who want a decisive split.
Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules.
Business leaders are triggering contingency plans to cope with additional checks on the post-Brexit UK-EU border they fear will clog ports, silt up the arteries of trade and dislocate supply chains in Europe and beyond.
Brexit supporters say there would be short-term disruption but in the long-term the UK would thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity that is falling behind China and the United States.
NO BREXIT
Since the 2016 referendum, opponents of Brexit have sought another vote they hope would overturn the result, but May has repeatedly ruled this out, saying it would undermine faith in democracy among the 17.4 million who voted in 2016 to leave.
A new referendum can only be called if it is approved by parliament and there is currently no majority in favor of one.
The opposition Labour Party wants to push for an election and only if that is rejected will it consider another referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a veteran euroskeptic who has also spoken out in the past against a second referendum.
However, a prominent pro-EU Conservative lawmaker, Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday submitted legislation making provisions for a second Brexit referendum.
If parliament agreed to a second referendum, Britain would have to ask for an extension to its timetable for leaving the EU to allow enough time for a campaign, probably by withdrawing its Article 50 formal departure notification.
The Electoral Commission would have to agree what question, or questions, would be asked of the public.
At the highest levels of government, there are worries that a second referendum would exacerbate the deep divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum, alienate millions of pro-Brexit voters and stoke support for the far-right. If Britons voted to remain, Brexit supporters might then demand a third and decisive vote.

""I became prime minister immediately after that (2016) referendum,"" May said minutes after her Brexit deal was rejected on Tuesday. ""I believe it is my duty to deliver on their instruction and I intend to do so.""

The Brexit divorce deal was resoundingly defeated by British lawmakers on Tuesday, with much of the opposition centered on the ""backstop"" requirement for the British province of Northern Ireland to stay closely aligned to EU rules to eliminate the need for border checks with EU member Ireland.
The Irish government joined the European Union's executive in insisting that the divorce deal with the bloc was not open for renegotiation and urged London to come up with solutions that both they and the European Union can accept. 
EU officials have said that were Britain, for instance, to drop its refusal to remain permanently in a customs union with the EU, then the bloc would be willing to negotiate that and this could ease difficulties around the Irish border.
The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier told Britain on Wednesday that it could have a different kind of Brexit deal -- but only if London changes its key demands.
""The only way we can avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in the long term is by having an agreement on customs, a common customs territory or customs union and regulatory alignment either between Northern Ireland and Ireland or the whole of the UK and the EU,"" Varadkar told parliament.

""That is what we negotiated in the withdrawal agreement and the backstop... Absolutely, I'll defend the backstop but the backstop is there as a means to an end. Let's not forget what the backstop is, it is a legal guarantee that the mechanisms will be put in place to ensure no hardening of the border. It's the outcome that we need to achieve.""

The Trump administration has taken steps to curb market penetration by Huwaei Technologies Cos Ltd  and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two of China's biggest network equipment makers, seeing them as spying threats. Both firms deny having any such purpose.
Interest by Huwaei and ZTE in Israel has worried its U.S. ally, as has the green light it granted China's Shanghai International Port Group in 2013 to build a private port near Haifa, a berth for the U.S. Mediterranean fleet.
""We know that the threat of cyber attacks is growing each and every day,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette said in a statement to Reuters during a visit to Israel.
He said that in his meetings with Israeli officials, he would ""share our experiences and concerns regarding certain Chinese foreign investment in Israel, and hope to continue a dialogue on best practices"".
One of Brouillette's hosts, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said in a statement after their meeting that the U.S. deputy secretary had ""raised their concern about the issue of foreign investments in the State of Israel"". 
There was no immediate Israeli comment on Chinese investment, however.
Asked separately about Chinese investment in Israel, Brouillette said in remarks aired by Israeli Army Radio: ""If done incorrectly, you inhibit the other allies from sharing intelligence with you.""
In a possible sign of U.S. displeasure at the Chinese involvement in Haifa, one of the Sixth Fleet's warships inOctober docked in Israel's second-tier Mediterranean port of Ashdod, the fleet’s first such visit in almost 20 years. 
In December 2016 Huawei acquired Israel's HexaTier, whose technology secures databases in the cloud, for $42 million. This followed a visit to Israel by the Chinese technology giant's CEO. That same month, it also acquired IT research firm TogaNetworks for an undisclosed amount. 
According to Israeli media, ZTE has shown interest inIsrael's tech sector since sending a senior delegation to the country in 2013. 

The Israeli daily Haaretz reported in 2016 that Israel has an undeclared policy of not using Huwaei or ZTE technologies, out of concern about possible security breaches. Israeli authorities have not commented on that report.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Explainer: The latest cash crunch behind Zimbabwe's protests,"By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Protests against fuel price hikes in Zimbabwe have entered their third day, posing a major challenge for President Emmerson Mnangagwa who replaced long-time leader Robert Mugabe and promised to repair the creaking economy.
The crisis will not be easy to fix. There is a severe shortage of dollars, fuel and medicines, while inflation hit 31 percent in November, the highest in a decade. Foreign investors are, by and large, staying away.
WHAT SPARKED THE LATEST CLASHES?
Everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals. In the past two months, the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods, including medicines, food and fuel.
Motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations, where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line.
On Saturday, Mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to $3.31 per liter from $1.32 from midnight, but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash U.S. dollars.
It was the final straw for some Zimbabweans, and violent protests broke out on Monday. Three people, including a police officer, died in those clashes, and since then much of the country has been at a standstill as people stay at home.
Many people blame Mnangagwa for failing to fulfill his pre-election promises to kick-start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong-arm rule of his predecessor.
GENESIS OF CASH SHORTAGES
The country abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before. In its place, the government adopted the U.S. dollar and other currencies including sterling and the South African rand.
People hoped the move would spell the end of spiraling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless.
But over time, supply of the U.S. and South African currencies dried up, so in November 2016 authorities in Harare launched a surrogate currency - paper 'bond notes' designed to ease acute hard currency shortages.
The notes, which now have a total face value of $400 million, are backed by a $500 million loan from the African Export and Import Bank, the central bank has said. They are used like cash.
Officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1:1, on the street $1 fetches up to 3 bond notes, reflecting the ongoing shortage of U.S. dollars and people's desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency.
A dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as $30 in bond notes. Companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits.
""ZOLLARS""
When the bond note was introduced, dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value.
Government borrowing via Treasury Bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold.
It is these electronic dollars, theoretically worth $10 billion and nicknamed ""zollars"" by economists, that are raising fears that Zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade.
Zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments.
Zollars remain officially pegged at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, but on the black market $1 is now worth $4 zollars. That has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments.
Zimbabwe's foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks' cover for imports, central bank data show.
The government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves. But on Friday, the finance minister said Zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months.
HOW ARE BUSINESSES AFFECTED?
Companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment, forcing them to buy dollars on the black market.
The government on Monday postponed wage negotiations with civil service unions who are planning a nationwide strike from Jan. 22 to press for U.S. dollar pay. Civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country.
Only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies, charities, or large international corporations are paid in U.S. dollars.
Last October, the central bank ordered banks to create separate U.S. dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas, which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar. 
The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch. The group said its members had a backlog of $480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers. 
Cooking oil and soap maker Olivine Industries said on Saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers $11 million.
Zimbabwe's largest brewing company Delta Beverages, part-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened.
WHAT'S NEXT?
Despite the unrest at home, Mnangagwa still plans a visit later this month to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is expected to hold meetings aimed at luring back foreign investment.
The former spy chief, installed after Mugabe's removal in a coup in November 2017, was elected in July amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for Zimbabwe, and has said his nation is ""open for business"".
But critics say the man nicknamed ""The Crocodile"" is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms, including repealing Mugabe-era laws that restrict the media.
Mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions against officials from the ZANU-PF ruling party, top military figures and some government-owned firms, which were imposed during Mugabe's rule for what Washington called violations of human rights and democracy.
The IMF has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country's reform program unless its $2 billion arrears with the World Bank, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank are paid.
Harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a program allowing the IMF to monitor its economic reforms, although it does not entail funding from the lender.

Analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now, but more clashes were expected unless Mnangagwa's administration could find a solution to the cash woes.

Some 130 lawmakers voted in favor of the plan of the center-right government, led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov while 84 deputies were against it, accusing the cabinet of breaching the tender rules.
A deal for Lockheed Martin's F-16V Block 70 would be worth around 1.8 billion levs ($1.05 billion), Bulgaria's biggest military procurement since the fall of Communist rule some 30 years ago.
Other bidders had included Sweden, with Saab's Gripen jets, and Italy, with second-hand Eurofighters.
Defence Minister Krasimir Karakachanov, who has conceded that the United States' bid exceeded the budget by 300 million levs, said that negotiations would last about four months, with the first meeting expected in Brussels next month.
""From now on there are many issues that we need to clarify - delivery dates, service... spare parts delivery,"" Karakachanov said.
The question of which warplanes to buy has been vexing successive governments in Bulgaria for more than a decade.
""The U.S. Embassy welcomes the decision today by Bulgaria’s National Assembly to initiate negotiations to acquire new F-16 Block 70 aircraft from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT),"" the U.S. Embassy in Sofia said in a statement.
""We look forward to continuing to strengthen our strategic partnership with our NATO Ally Bulgaria.""

The plan has spurred heated political debates in the Black Sea country with supporters hailing it as a strategic choice for Bulgaria but many in the Balkan country criticized the process with President Rumen Radev describing it as ""a triumph of lobbying"".

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",New passage to Britain as Iranian migrants use boats to cross Channel,"By Julie Carriat, Noemie Olive and John Irish
CALAIS, France (Reuters) - Mohamed's first attempt to reach Britain's southern shores in December foundered because the outboard engine was not powerful enough to propel the boat carrying him and half a dozen other Iranian migrants through the choppy English Channel.
Last year saw a sharp increase in the number of migrants trying to cross the narrow waterway separating mainland Europe and Britain by boat.
Most of them were Iranians. Now, French police patrol the sandy beaches near the northern port of Calais every night, searching for migrants gathering to take to the sea.
""Everyone can succeed. The police only get us if our engine breaks,"" Mohamed told Reuters, declining to reveal his full name.
The 38-year-old Iranian Kurd left his wife and children in Tehran over two years ago in search of a more prosperous life in Britain, turning his back on his homeland even before renewed U.S. sanctions began squeezing Iran's economy. He plans to ask to bring his family over once he reaches Britain.
""I'll try again when I am ready,"" he said, adding that he was hunting for a new boat.
Calais has long served as a launch pad for migrants targeting Britain, which lies just 21 miles (34 km) away at the closest point - but across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
A sprawling migrant camp razed by the French government in late 2016 housed thousands of mostly African and Afghani migrants who would try to enter Britain hidden in lorries, trains and ferries.
Mohamed is part of a new trend: Iranians crossing by small boats, often rigid inflatables bought online, and sometimes stolen fishing boats. In 2018, 276 people reached Britain, of which the overwhelming majority were Iranians, France's interior ministry said in early January.
Charity workers estimate that some 200 Iranians of different social and economic class are waiting to attempt a crossing.
""Since September we've been seeing Iranians, who we didn't see before, and they're crossing by boats. They are the only ones ready to risk it. It's probably because of the sanctions,"" said Maya Konforti, an official at the local Auberge des Migrants charity, referring to economic sanctions re-imposed on Iran by the United States.
Their decision to attempt the crossing comes despite Britain remaining on course to leave the European Union, a move fueled in part by anti-immigration sentiment.
Many of Mohamed's comrades have money. Migrants said that a small group could club together and buy a dinghy and outboard engine for about 5,000 euros ($5,703.00) on websites like Le Bon Coin, a local version of EBay.
That price, they said, compared with the roughly 10,000 euros per head price tag demanded by traffickers who prefer to send migrants across by truck and who guarantee success - even if it entails numerous attempts.
""Maybe the Europeans are scared of dying, but we know we'll die one day so perhaps it will be here,"" Mohamed said. 
RISKS OF ANOTHER GRAVEYARD
President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran and re-impose sanctions has hurt Iran's economy, in particular its oil industry. Its rial currency has fluctuated wildly, making it difficult for people to make ends meet.
Truck drivers, farmers, workers, merchants and teachers have led sporadic protests in Iran, resulting in violent confrontations with security forces.
The Iranian migrants in Calais are a mixed demographic. One young man showed a photo of himself in a sharp suit at his brother's wedding. Another took out a picture of himself in full army uniform before he fled the country.
The number of Iranians in and around Calais began swelling in late 2017, after Serbia scrapped a visa requirement for Iranian citizens in August that year, opening up an easier route to the European Union.
Belgrade scrapped the move 14 months later after 1,100 sought asylum in the country. Others moved on.
Despite Britain's decision to leave the EU, the country fulfils the migrants' criteria of an Anglophone destination deemed more welcoming than mainland Europe, where they consider themselves unwanted and mistreated.
""The danger is not at sea, it is here. At sea it's over in two minutes, but here everyday it's finished,"" said a second Iranian migrant in his late twenties, bemoaning the French police's heavy-handed tactics.
French authorities say they take a tough approach to discourage people from returning to the northern coast.
So far, no migrants have perished crossing the Channel by boat. But local residents fear that may change if the flow of clandestine crossings is not stemmed.

""I don't want the Channel to become a second tomb like the Mediterranean because of the poor management of these people, which forces them to take unnecessary risks,"" said Damien Careme, mayor of Grande-Synthe, a town some 40 kilometers west of Calais where 200 migrants are housed in a gymnasium.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Taliban officials say Pakistan applying pressure over Afghan talks,"By Jibran Ahmad
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The arrest of a senior Taliban leader in Pakistan this week underlines a push by the government in Islamabad to pressure the insurgents to open talks with the Afghan government, Taliban officials said.
Hafiz Mohibullah, a senior military commander who has been closely involved in talks with the United States, was arrested in Peshawar, close to the border with Afghanistan, at the weekend but was subsequently released.
""After his arrest, Pakistani authorities started raids on many other houses of the Taliban movement, their friends and commanders in different places in Pakistan,"" said one senior Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Taliban confirmed that Mohibullah had been released on Wednesday and spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he was safe.
The move came as talks between Taliban representatives and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad hit a stumbling block after the insurgents issued a statement on Tuesday threatening to stall peace talks.
Khalilzad, who arrived in Kabul on Tuesday, was due to meet Taliban representatives in Qatar last week but the meeting was canceled.
The Taliban have so far refused to talk to the Afghan government, which they dismiss as a puppet regime put in place by foreign powers.
According to Taliban sources, the dispute highlights a split that has emerged among countries with an interest in the region, with Pakistan and the United States pushing the Taliban to open talks with Kabul and other countries, including Iran, supporting the Taliban's stance.
""Iran and Qatar are supporting Taliban's way but Pakistan is saying what the Afghan government and the U.S. wanted,"" he said.
Officials in Islamabad say Pakistan is keenly aware that Afghanistan will continue to need huge amounts of foreign aid to keep its shattered economy afloat after any peace settlement and have been working closely with the United States.
Islamabad fears that any hasty withdrawal of foreign forces could trigger an uncontrolled collapse of the Afghan government, leaving a vacuum that could send tens of thousands of refugees across the border.
The Afghan government regularly accuses Pakistan of providing support to the Taliban. Pakistani officials deny this but say they have a degree of influence which they have been using to try to persuade the movement to accept peace talks.

Merkel told a closed session of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee on Wednesday that she would need to coordinate with other EU leaders after British legislators rejected the withdrawal agreement the evening before.
""For me it is clear that there cannot be any renegotiations,"" Merkel told the meeting, two participants said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will try to forge a consensus in parliament on a Brexit divorce agreement after the crushing defeat of her own deal left Britain's exit from the EU in disarray 10 weeks before it is due to leave.
Merkel said the idea of pushing back Brexit beyond the scheduled date of March 29 was a ""fictional question"", the participants said.
Merkel said she was open to making further clarifications to a declaration on Britain's future relations with Brussels, but it was up to London to say what it wanted after the parliamentary vote, the participants said.
Before entering the meeting, Merkel told reporters it was necessary to keep trying to secure an orderly Brexit but stressed that Germany was prepared if Britain did end up exiting the EU in a disorderly fashion.
She said she regretted that the British parliament had rejected the deal negotiated with the EU and May needed to say how Britain would proceed.
""We think now it is up to the British side,"" Merkel said. ""We want to keep damage to a minimum, and there will be damage with the departure of Britain.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish police have detained at least 10 people since Tuesday over calls on social media for murder and acts of aggression made in the wake of the killing on a public stage of Gdansk's mayor.
Mayor Pawel Adamowicz, a critic of anti-immigrant policies, was stabbed on Sunday evening by a man who rushed the stage during a charity event. He died the following day, plunging Poland into mourning.
Polish media has reported a few incidents of threats against some liberal mayors since then.
Internal Affairs Minister Joachim Brudzinski said in statement on Wednesday: ""Polish police officers throughout the country have already detained more than 10 since yesterday in connection with online calls for murders and acts of aggression.""
""Once again I appeal to stop bad emotions,"" he said, promising a strong police response.
Critics have said politicians themselves were cranking up hate speech and aggression in public life, and blamed the ruling Law and Justice party for not reacting earlier. 
Adamowicz was one of 11 mayors in Poland who were the targets of fake death certificates by a far-right group called All-Polish Youth after they signed a declaration to welcome refugees against the government's anti-migration policies.
The prosecutor's office decided not to pursue the case further. 
Thousands of people have gathered in vigils in Polish cities to mourn the death of Adamowicz, who had been mayor of Gdansk for 20 years and espoused liberal causes at odds with the conservative nationalist government.
Polish authorities have arrested a 27-year-old former convict named Stefan in connection with the murder. His full name has so far been withheld.
The police said on Monday a 72-year-old Warsaw man was detained after threatening in a phone call to a social welfare center that the next in line to be killed was President Andrzej Duda.
On Wednesday Polish news agency PAP said police in Gdansk detained a 48-year-old suspected of making threats on the phone against European Council President and former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

The incidents reflect a charged political atmosphere in a number of European countries, including Poland and Hungary, where populist leaders have fanned nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's deputy prime minister said the government would emerge stronger after winning a confidence vote later on Wednesday and be able to secure parliament's endorsement for an accord to end a dispute over Macedonia's name.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called the confidence vote following the resignation of his right-wing coalition partner Panos Kammenos in protest over the accord.
Greek opponents of the agreement say Macedonia's new name - the Republic of North Macedonia - reached after decades of dispute between Athens and Skopje - represents an attempt to appropriate Greek identity. Macedonia is the name of Greece's biggest northern region. 
Tsipras has said that if he wins the vote with an absolute majority of 151 in the 300-seat parliament, he will bring the so-called Prespes agreement to parliament for approval this month. If he fails, he said he would call a snap election.
An early election could delay reform implementation, privatizations and Greece's efforts to return to bond markets. Tsipras' party is trailing by up to 12 points behind the main conservative New Democracy party, which opposes the deal.
""The government will win a confidence vote and rise stronger and more coherent from this process,"" Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragassakis told lawmakers hours before the vote takes place, around midnight (2200 GMT).
""The Prespes agreement will be endorsed because there is the (required) parliamentary majority."" 
Dragassakis said that winning both votes would restore political stability in the country that just emerged from its third international bailout since 2010 and allow Greece to return to bond markets when the time is right. 
Based on the country's constitution, Tsipras only needs to secure half of those present during the vote and at least 120 votes out of the house's 300 to win. But he wants to get 151 votes and have an absolute parliamentary majority.
Tsipras' Syriza party has 145 seats in the 300-seat chamber and the support of one independent lawmaker, and needs at least five more to get past the threshold of 150 deputies. 
Four dissenters from Kammenos's party said they would support the prime minister, while one lawmaker from the small centrist To Potami party said he would also back Tsipras. 
Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Greek TV on Wednesday that the government wants the Macedonia name agreement also approved with 151 votes. 

Macedonia's parliament last week passed an amendment to the constitution to rename the country, leaving it up to Greece to ratify the deal. Greek parliamentary endorsement is needed for the tiny Balkan nation to join the European Union and NATO.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 07:03AM ET</span>",Turkey-backed rebels await 'zero hour' to attack Syria's Manbij,"By Khalil Ashawi
JARABLUS, Syria (Reuters) - Rebel commander Adnan Abu Faisal and his army are encamped near the frontline in northern Syria, waiting to launch an offensive on his home city of Manbij.
But they are not the ones who will decide whether to march on the strategically important city, held for more than two years by Kurdish forces supported by the United States. 
The decision will depend on Turkey, the main backer of Abu Faisal's group, and on how contacts evolve between Washington and Ankara over the United States' plans to withdraw forces from Syria, a move set to reshape a major theater of the war.
(graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RgCxxb) 
The United States and Turkey are allies both in the NATO defense alliance and in the fight against Islamic State, but Ankara sees the Kurdish YPG forces that helped the U.S.-led coalition drive IS out of Manbij in 2016 as a security threat.
The YPG fear the U.S. withdrawal will open the way for a threatened Turkish attack into northern Syria, including Manbij, but U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Turkey of ""economic devastation"" if it goes ahead with the attack.
Abu Faisal's fighters are awaiting orders near Jarablus, a town held by Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies about 35 km (22 miles) south of Manbij. The frontline in the area runs through open farmland where wheat and corn are usually grown.
""We are ready with our forces ... for 'zero hour' to begin any military action,"" Abu Faisal, whose forces have more than 300 vehicles including pickup trucks and armored vehicles provided by Turkey, told Reuters.
""Preparations are going at full speed,"" he said.
Abu Faisal, 36, was an army captain before Syria's civil war began in 2011 but defected from the Syrian army in 2012 to join the fight against President Bashar al-Assad. 
Abu Faisal helped wrest control of Manbij from the Syrian army early in the conflict but fled when it was seized by Islamic State in 2014 and has not set foot there since then.
The YPG have also left Manbij but retain influence over the Kurdish-allied groups that hold the city 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Turkey.
Manbij lies near the junction of three separate blocks of territory that form spheres of Russian, Turkish and, for now, U.S. influence.
The U.S. military pullout will not only leave Kurds exposed to possible confrontation with Turkey but will also open the way for the expansion of Russian and Iranian sway into the areas that U.S. forces will be leaving.
The U.S. military deployed into Syria as part of the fight against Islamic State but officials later indicated wider objectives included containing Iran, Assad's main regional ally.
Late last month, the YPG called on Assad's forces to protect Manbij from attack by Turkey. Syrian government forces, which are backed by Russia, answered the YPG appeal by deploying outside Manbij.
Abu Faisal's rebel fighters, backed by Turkish forces, made their own advance towards the city the same day but stopped short of an attack. Since then, Turkey has been engaged in diplomatic contacts with Washington and Assad's Russian allies.
The Kurds who control swaths of northern Syria have turned to Russia and the Syrian government since Trump's announcement, hoping to secure a deal that keeps Turkey at bay and preserves their autonomy within a reformed Syrian state.
Abu Faisal said ""political understandings"" would determine whether an attack went ahead, reflecting the influence of foreign powers in the Syrian conflict. A political solution that spared blood would be welcome, he added. 
TRUST IN TURKEY
For Abu Faisal, the YPG -- People’s Protection Units -- is no less of an enemy than IS or Assad.
Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights, mostly in southeastern areas near Syria.
A top Kurdish politician told Reuters this month the Kurds had presented Moscow with a road map for a deal with Damascus.. Syria's deputy foreign minister has said he is optimistic about renewed dialogue with the Kurds.
A deal between Damascus and the Kurds would piece back together the two largest chunks of Syria and leave one corner of the northwest under the control of anti-Assad insurgents who have been driven out of many of the areas they once held.
Abu Faisal -- head of the opposition's Manbij Military Council in exile -- says it would be a catastrophe if Assad were allowed to recover Manbij. He warned this would trigger yet more displacement of civilians fleeing a return of Assad's rule.
His priority is to secure the return home of Manbij residents who have been living either as refugees in Turkey or in nearby areas of northern Syria that are controlled by Turkey and its Syrian allies.
""There cannot be acceptance of any political solution or military solution except with the return of these displaced people to their city,"" Abu Faisal said. 
""Our goal is to reassure the people of Manbij that its people will run the affairs of this city,"" he said.

The European Commission's chief spokesman told reporters the withdrawal agreement itself, which sets out terms for British departure, would not be renegotiated. He implied the other key part of the deal -- a political declaration on expectations for post-Brexit trade terms -- could be reworked.
Asked about comments by EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain could have different trade terms if it changed its ""red lines"", spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: ""We are always ready to meet and to talk but ... the withdrawal agreement -- and, I repeat, the withdrawal agreement -- agreed by the 27 and the United Kingdom, is not open for renegotiation."" 

EU officials have said that were Britain to, say, drop its refusal to remain permanently in a customs union with the EU, then the bloc would be willing to negotiate that and that this could also ease difficulties around the Northern Ireland border which generated some of the British parliament's resistance.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 06:45AM ET</span>",Disgraced U.S. ex-cardinal could be defrocked soon: Vatican sources,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Disgraced former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick is almost certain to be defrocked in the next few weeks over allegations against him, including sexual abuse of minors, two Vatican sources said.
Last July, McCarrick became the first Catholic prelate in nearly 100 years to lose the title of cardinal. The allegations against him date back to decades ago when he was still rising to the top of the U.S. Church hierarchy.
McCarrick, 88, has responded publicly to only one of the allegations, saying he has ""absolutely no recollection"" of an alleged case of sexual abuse of a 16-year-old boy more than 50 years ago. 
McCarrick's canon lawyer, J. Michael Ritty, and his civil lawyer, Barry Coburn, both declined to be interviewed for this article. The Vatican said a ""canonical process"" was taking place and that there would be no comment until it ends.
Pope Francis, who has the final say in the case, wants it completed before heads of national Catholic churches meet at the Vatican from Feb. 21-24 to discuss what is now a global sexual abuse crisis, three sources said.
The meeting offers a chance for him to respond to criticism from victims of abuse that he has stumbled in his handling of the crisis and has not done enough to make bishops accountable.
""It would be like a trophy to show that the pope is indeed serious about dealing with this. That is the process that seems to be unfolding,"" said Kurt Martens, professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America in Washington.
McCarrick, who rose to be an important power broker in the American Church as Archbishop of Washington, D.C. from 2001 to 2006, has already received one of the most severe punishments short of defrocking. When the pope accepted his resignation as cardinal last July, he also ordered him to refrain from public ministry and live in seclusion, prayer and penitence. 
A month earlier, American Church officials said the allegations that McCarrick sexually abused a 16-year-old-boy were ""credible and substantiated"".
One Vatican source with knowledge of the Vatican proceedings said it would be stunning if the pope did not dismiss McCarrick from the clergy, a process known as ""laicization"".
""I don't know what the alternative would be,"" another source said. 
He and the other Vatican sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the case. One of the sources said that if he is defrocked, McCarrick will be the highest profile Roman Catholic figure to be dismissed from the priesthood in modern times.
Defrocking would mean McCarrick could no longer call himself a priest or celebrate the sacraments, although he would be allowed to administer to a person on the verge of death in an emergency. 
CONFINED TO A KANSAS FRIARY
McCarrick has been confined to a Franciscan friary in a tiny town in remote northern Kansas. 
In the past few weeks the top officials of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which handles sexual abuse cases, have been reviewing documentation and testimony about McCarrick, two of the Vatican sources said.
This is part of what is known as an ""administrative process,"" which is much more streamlined than a full canonical trial. It is the path taken when there is an abundance of clear evidence, one of the Vatican sources said.
The procedures can result in a defrocking decree from the CDF, signed by its prefect Cardinal Luis Francisco Ladaria and approved by the pope. The pope, who is the Church's supreme legislator, can also decide to take over the dossier personally and rule on it himself. 
A papal ruling could not be appealed. A decree by the CDF could be appealed within 60 days. A third possibility is that the pope could approve a CDF decree but shorten the appeals time so that the case is over before the bishops' meeting in February.
A Vatican source confirmed that McCarrick was accused of sexual misconduct involving a child, sexual misconduct involving an adult, and solicitation.
Solicitation is a separate crime under canon law and refers to when a priest uses the pretext of the sacrament of confession to commit an immoral act with a penitent.
Separately, several priests and ex-priests have come forward alleging McCarrick used his authority to coerce them to sleep with him when they were adult seminarians studying for the priesthood. 
McCarrick has not commented publicly on these allegations.
Pope Francis ordered a ""thorough study"" last year of all documents in Holy See offices concerning McCarrick. The four U.S. dioceses where he served - New York, Metuchen, Newark, and Washington, D.C. - have launched independent investigations.

On Monday, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who last August accused the pope of covering up for McCarrick, issued a letter urging McCarrick to publicly repent for his ""sins, crimes and sacrileges,"" saying such a gesture would bring ""healing to a gravely wounded and suffering Church"".

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>","As teachers get paid, learning returns to bombed-out Yemen school","TAIZ, Yemen (Reuters) - Its books have been looted and walls blown out, but a school in war-torn southern Yemen is hopeful that the resumption of regular salary payments can keep teachers and children in classrooms.
""In the past few months things have stabilized, teachers' salaries have begun to be paid, and hopefully things will continue this way,"" said Hoda Naged Useid, the head of the Arwa school in Yemen's third-largest city, Taiz.
The government-held city, surrounded to the north by Houthi forces, has been at the center of an almost four-year war pitting the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement against a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the internationally recognized Yemeni government.
The Houthis, who seized the capital Sanaa in 2014 and hold most urban centers, say their revolution is against corruption.
In Taiz buildings and homes have been looted and damaged, Useid said, but people are nevertheless returning due to a de-escalation of fighting amid U.N.-led peace efforts. 
""If salaries are paid regularly and as they were previously, things will get better,"" Useid said. Arwa's teachers had previously been volunteering without pay.
Yemen's central bank, split into two rival head offices, has struggled to pay public sector wages as foreign exchange reserves dwindle.
The war and ensuing economic collapse has left 15.9 million people - 53 percent of the population - facing severe hunger and struggling to access basic goods and services.
Yemen's warring parties agreed last month on a peace deal in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, and the two sides agreed to set up a committee to establish humanitarian corridors to Taiz. No progress has been made yet, however.
Displacement, poverty and forced conscription have disrupted Yemeni children's education.
""Because of the destruction in the schools, some of the students headed to the frontlines,"" said Ibtisam Dael, a teacher at Arwa school.
Fighting since 2015, when the Sunni Muslim Arab coalition intervened in the civil war, has left many schools in ruins. 
""There is nowhere to play in the school,"" said 16-year old Hamas Mansour in front of a pile of broken and twisted desks in an outdoor space where children should have been milling around.
Whole sections of Arwa school are unusable and all books, equipment and chairs have been stolen, Useid said. Until September, the children were using a nearby mosque to study in.

""We were determined to return to our school ... and we began clearing the rubble,"" she said, hopeful that more pupils would join the 700 already there.

The Hague (Reuters) - Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court on Wednesday asked judges to bar former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo from returning to his homeland, a day after he was acquitted on charges of crimes against humanity.
In Tuesday's shock ruling, judges found that prosecutors had failed to prove any case against Gbagbo and they could no longer justify his detention, more than seven years after he was arrested and extradited to the court.
Gbagbo's acquittal was deplored by victims' groups for those who died in violence following Ivory Coast's 2010 elections that Gbagbo was accused of orchestrating. But it was welcomed by his supporters and opened the possibility that he could return to politics in Ivory Coast.
As the court reconvened on Wednesday to discuss the terms of Gbagbo's release, prosecutors said that they intended to appeal his acquittal, once the judges publish their formal decision and full reasoning.
They asked that Gbagbo therefore not be allowed to return to Ivory Coast due to concern he might not again submit to the court's jurisdiction for appeals proceedings.
Lawyers for the Ivory Coast politician said the prosecution request showed they hadn't yet come to terms with the scale of their legal defeat.
""Laurent Gbagbo is no longer an accused person. Laurent Gbagbo has been acquitted. He is no longer presumed to be innocent - he has been acknowledged as being innocent,"" Gbagbo's lawyer Emmanuel Altit told the court.

""He was acquitted of all accusations by the prosecutors. In these circumstances it is also meaningless to consider that Laurent Gbagbo would be a flight risk, or would abscond justice - justice has acquitted him.""

The UK parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday, prompting expressions of concern among EU leaders who say they are stepping up emergency planning for a possible 'hard Brexit'.
Kurz said the EU could help to further clarify aspects of the withdrawal deal but that Britain needed to take the initiative and state clearly what it wants.

Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a resounding defeat on her Brexit plan in parliament on Tuesday, plunging the country into political uncertainty. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. 
Some British politicians have suggested that Russia may have meddled in the 2016 Brexit referendum in an attempt to weaken the West, an allegation Moscow has denied.
Lavrov, addressing a news conference in Moscow, said Russia took no pleasure from Britain's Brexit-related political crisis despite its difficult relations with London, which were worsened by the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, in England in March last year. 
""We won't and aren't saying anything about Brexit, though people are constantly saying and writing that Russia is rubbing its hands together and gloating. Nothing of the kind,"" said Lavrov. 
He said Brexit was a matter for Britain, but that Russia was naturally interested in how it would affect the EU, one of Moscow's main trading partners.

HARARE (Reuters) - Armed Zimbabwean police arrested a political activist at his home on Wednesday, his lawyer said, the third day of protests against fuel price hikes as businesses and schools stayed closed and networks enforced a government internet shutdown.
Evan Mawarire, a Harare pastor who rose to prominence as a critic of former leader Robert Mugabe, was bundled into the back seat of a truck by about a dozen police. He was to be charged with inciting public violence, said lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, who witnessed the arrest along with a Reuters cameraman.
Wednesday is the third and final day of stay-at-home protests called by unions in response to the steep hike in fuel prices, which was decreed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Three people including a police officer died on Monday during violent demonstrations.
Mawarire, who led a national shutdown in 2016, told Reuters police had surrounded his house after he used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts to urge Zimbabweans to heed the unions' calls.
Shops, banks and fast-food chains in the capital stayed closed on Wednesday, along with some government offices, and there was no public transport and little other road traffic. 
In central Harare, police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd queuing for bread at a shopping center, a Reuters witness said. Soldiers were controlling a disorderly line at the only shop that was open.
Many Zimbabweans accuse Mnangagwa of failing to live up to pre-election pledges to kick-start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong-arm rule of Mugabe, who was forced out in November 2017 after 37 years in power.
Since then, the country has seen a familiar pattern of dollar shortages battering the economy, rocketing inflation that is destroying the value of their savings and the government reacting forcefully to crush dissent. 
The government has blamed the protests on the main opposition and local rights groups, calling it part of a plot to overthrow Mnangagwa's administration. 
Mawarire rose to prominence in 2016 when he launched a social media movement - #ThisFlag - to encourage Zimbabweans to speak out against Mugabe policies the pastor blamed for high unemployment, widespread corruption and delays in getting salaries.
He was acquitted in 2017 on charges of public violence and disorderly conduct.
Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, the country's largest mobile operator, said its internet services had been cut off following an order from the government.
""We are obliged to act when directed to do so and the matter is beyond our control,"" Econet said in a text message to customers, adding that all networks and providers had suspended their services.
Internet services were cut by mid-morning on Tuesday, leaving many people without access to social media platforms amid accusations that the government wanted to prevent images of its heavy-handedness from being broadcast around the world.

Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters on Tuesday that she was not aware of the blackout.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied on Wednesday that Moscow was imposing an ultimatum on Japan in talks to end a decades-long territorial dispute, but called on Tokyo to recognize the results of World War Two. 
Japan is seeking a peace deal with Russia it hopes will end a dispute over islands captured by Soviet troops in the last days of World War Two, a disagreement that has long soured bilateral relations. 
The islands are known as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has launched a diplomatic campaign to strike a deal with Moscow. 
Russia says Tokyo must recognize Russian sovereignty over the islands before progress can be made in peace talks, however.
""These are not pre-conditions, it's just an effort to understand why Japan is the only country in the world which cannot say: 'I accept the results of World War Two in their entirety',"" Lavrov told a news conference.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono held talks about the territorial dispute with Lavrov in Moscow on Monday and Shinzo Abe is to have discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 22.
Lavrov has said a Russian desire to normalize relations with Tokyo meant it agreed to step up talks about the territorial dispute and the peace deal, but that significant differences remain between the two sides. 

Opinion polls show most Russians oppose handing back the islands to Japan, and Russian nationalists plan to stage a demonstration in Moscow this weekend calling on the Kremlin to keep the territory.

His family say he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding. Whelan faces up to 20 years in jail if found guilty of espionage.

Lavrov said the investigation into Whelan continued and his detention was not motivated by any desire to try to exchange him for Russian citizens held in the United States.

He said Russia would allow U.S. diplomats to visit Whelan for a second time and that an Irish diplomat was also due to meet him soon.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India opposition politicians and media called for a colonial-era sedition law to be scrapped on Wednesday, accusing authorities of trying to suppress dissent after it was invoked against students marking the execution of a Kashmiri militant.
Police used the 1870 law against 10 people, including a student organizer, for the 2016 rally at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University where police say anti-India posters were raised.
The students denied the allegations and critics said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was trying to curb free speech and pander to his Hindu nationalist base ahead of his re-election bid in a few months.
""There is no need for a sedition law in today's times, it is a colonial law,"" said Kapil Sibal, a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party. 
""Many who merely speak or tweet against the government have sedition charges imposed against them; it is being misused by the center just to keep citizens in check.""
Kanhaiya Kumar, the student leader, attended the rally questioning the execution of the Kashmiri separatist convicted of an attack on parliament in 2001, but his lawyers said he rejected the use of violence and made no incendiary comments.
Instead, his supporters said he criticized a right-wing student fraternity and a Hindu-nationalist umbrella group to which Modi’s ruling party belongs.
""The fact that the charges are being made three years after the alleged use of ""anti-national slogans"" by JNU students in February 2016, and on the eve of the general elections, suggests that their motive is political,"" Manoj Joshi, a fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation, wrote in Mail Today.
India is sensitive about Kashmir, its only Muslim majority state, where it is struggling to put down a decades-old revolt. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.
Hindu nationalists tied to Modi's party have long advocated a tough posture on Kashmir and say any policy of appeasement undermines India's security.
The sedition law carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
""Independent India should have the confidence to scrap the anachronistic sedition law suited for the police state that existed before 1947, and let free speech flourish without fearing its own citizens so much,"" The Economic Times said.
Police in the remote northeastern Indian state of Assam said last week they were also investigating an academic, a journalist and a peasant leader for possible sedition for publicly opposing a proposal to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority countries.
""This law now needs to go. A mature, liberal democracy cannot fight its own citizens,"" the Hindustan Times said.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",China brushes off international concern over death sentence for Canadian,"By Philip Wen
BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday that it was ""not worried in the slightest"" by mounting international concern over the death sentence handed to a Canadian for drug smuggling.
Monday's sentence for Robert Schellenberg for smuggling 222 kg (489 lbs) of methamphetamines prompted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of ""arbitrarily"" applying the death penalty.
The United Nations said it was opposed to the death penalty apart from exceptional circumstances, and Australia's acting foreign minister Simon Birmingham said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the case. 
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Canada's ""so-called allies could be counted on ten fingers"" and did not represent the views of the wider international community. 
""I can very clearly state that we are not worried in the slightest,"" Hua said of the mounting outcry, adding that a majority of Chinese supported severe punishment for drug crimes. 
Schellenberg's sentence has further strained relations between China and Canada, already aggravated by the December arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], on a U.S. extradition request as part of an investigation into suspected violations of U.S. trade sanctions. 
Days after Meng's arrest in Vancouver, China detained two Canadians on suspicion of endangering state security.
China has not linked any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest, but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released.
The Global Times, a state-run tabloid with a nationalistic bent, said China ""cannot be weak at this time"". 
""Canada does not have any special cards that can allow Chinese law to bow its head to it,"" the newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday, adding that Canada's protests would have no effect. 
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that Ottawa had formally applied for clemency for Schellenberg, as it usually does for citizens condemned to death abroad.
When asked if China typically listened to this type of request, Hua said the judiciary was not subject to ""interference from administrative organs"".
""You ask whether China is willing to listen to the Canadian side's request, but I don't know if Canada's leaders or politicians have seriously listened to China's solemn position,"" Hua said.
""We have very clearly outlined the case's facts and its seriousness,"" she added.
Schellenberg had appealed against an original 15-year prison sentence issued in November, but the court in Liaoning province sided with prosecutors who argued at a retrial that the punishment was too light.

A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, said his client would appeal.

Russia seized three Ukrainian navy vessels and their combined crew of 24 on Nov. 25 near Russian-annexed Crimea. Moscow accuses them of illegally entering Russian waters, something Kiev denies.
In similar rulings on Tuesday, the court extended the detention of the other 20 Ukrainians until April 24 and, in the case of four of them, until April 26.
The United States and European Union have called on Russia to release the men, but the Kremlin has said they must be put on trial. No date has been set for a trial.

Moscow could hand over the men as part of a prisoner swap deal with Ukraine later this year, a Russian diplomatic source was quoted as saying last week by the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper.

After four months of political deadlock, Lofven has the backing of the Center, Liberals and Greens to be prime minister after a historic deal bringing together parties from the centre-left and center-right blocs.
But he also needs the Left Party, which said on Monday it was not ready to lend its support unless Lofven gave assurances the party would still have a voice in policy-making.
Lofven said he had held constructive talks with the Left Party leader Jonas Sjostedt, but declined to say whether the party would support him in Friday's vote. 
""I am ready to be nominated as Prime Minister of Sweden and to take it to a vote on Friday,"" he told reporters after meeting parliament's speaker.
On Monday, Lofven had said there would be no point in the speaker nominating him as prime minister unless the Left Party were prepared to back him.
September's election delivered a hung parliament and the centre-left and center-right blocs have been at loggerheads on how to form a government without the support of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white-supremacist fringe and who hold the balance of power.

Washington has threatened to pull out of the 1987 pact, alleging that a new Russian missile violates the treaty, which bans either side from stationing short and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe.

A U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer the USS McCampbell, which is based in Japan, and a Royal Navy frigate, HMS Argyll, which is on a tour of Asia, conducted communication drills and other exercises from Friday to Wednesday ""to address common security priorities"", the U.S. Navy said in a press release.
""There's no record in recent history of operations together, specifically in the South China Sea,"" a U.S. Navy spokesman said.
No such joint drills have been conducted there since at least 2010, he added. 
The exercise comes after another British warship, the 22,000 ton HMS Albion, sailed close to the Paracel island chain claimed by China in the South China Sea in August. 
It was the first time Britain had directly challenged China's growing control of the strategic waterway and came after the United States said it would like to see more international participation in such action. Beijing accused London of engaging in ""provocation"". 
The McCampbell this month passed within 12 nautical miles of the same island chain in a freedom of navigation operation, which the U.S. Navy said was to ""challenge excessive maritime claims"".
China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Neither the United States of Britain has territorial claims in the area.
Pictures of China's island bases released last year appear to show truck-mounted surface-to-air missiles or anti-ship cruise missiles. China’s air force has also landed bombers on disputed islands as part of a training exercises in the region.

A police spokesman confirmed media reports that the suspect worked for Malaysia's Malindo Air, a subsidiary of Indonesia's Lion Air. Malindo Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 38-year-old airline crew member was part of a group that brought drugs from Malaysia on aircraft for sale in Australian cities, police and customs officials said in a statement.
The gang, which police believe was run by a Vietnamese crime syndicate, was based in the city of Melbourne, Tess Walsh, Victoria State police crime command assistant commissioner, told reporters.
Police seized some 14 kg of drugs when the suspects were rounded up but the gang was believed to have been smuggling drugs for a long time.
""Intelligence would tell us that this crew has been operating for some years, I would say five plus,"" Walsh said.
Australia is a lucrative market for suppliers of drugs from Southeast Asia. It has one of the world's highest per-capita rates of methamphetamine use, government statistics show.
Police said they had made the eight arrests over the past 10 days, apprehending four women and four men aged between 26 and 55 in and around Melbourne.
They faced drug trafficking charges and appeared in court on Wednesday. No pleas were entered and they will next appear on May 15.

Kanter, a vocal critic of President Tayyip Erdogan, was indicted by a Turkish court last year over alleged membership of an ""armed terrrorist group"" after being contacted repeatedly by people close to Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
The Istanbul prosecutors' office was not immediately available to comment on the report on Wednesday.
Anadolu said on Tuesday prosecutors had sought the issue of a ""red notice"" for Kanter, an Interpol request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition.
It said the extradition request includes social media comments made about Gulen by Kanter, who has often declared his support for the cleric.
Turkey previously revoked Kanter's passport, and declared him a fugitive for his support of Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of being behind the attempted putsch of July 2016 - an accusation Gulen denies.
In May 2017, Kanter was refused entry into Romania because of the cancellation of his Turkish passport.
Earlier this month, Kanter said he would not go to London for a game with his NBA team because he fears he could be assassinated for criticizing Erdogan.
Since the putsch attempt, some 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 150,000 state employees including teachers, judges and soldiers have been suspended or dismissed in a crackdown on alleged supporters of Gulen.

Kanter holds a U.S. green card that allows him to live and work in the country on a permanent basis.

Malaysia's cabinet decided last week that Israelis will not be allowed to enter the country for any event, Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Wednesday.
""Even if we have already committed to hosting an event, they will not be allowed (into the country),"" he said in a recording of a press conference heard by Reuters.
""Secondly, Malaysia will not host any event that has representation from or participation of Israel.""
On Monday, AFP quoted the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as saying that it was ""disappointed"" with Malaysia's decision to bar the swimmers from entering the country, but hoped to ""find a solution"" to the matter.
Swimmers from some 70 countries are expected to compete at the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships in the eastern state of Sarawak from July 29-Aug. 4.
Malaysia, a majority-Muslim country, has long supported a two-state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
Thousands in Malaysia and neighboring Indonesia took to the streets last December to protest Washington's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Last month, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized Australia's decision to follow the U.S. in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying countries had ""no rights"" to do so.
Saifuddin said Malaysia will continue to take a strong position on the plight of the Palestinians, which Malaysia considers to be a humanitarian crisis.
""We are looking at the Palestinian issue not simply from the religious point of view... it is a humanitarian, human rights issue,"" he said. 
""It is about fighting on behalf of the oppressed.""

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Modi's party wants expansionary economic policy ahead of India election,"By Krishna N. Das and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party is in favor of an expansionary economic policy and does not consider the government's plan to keep the fiscal deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP as ""sacrosanct"", a party spokesman told Reuters.
Ahead of a general election that must be held by May and after a string of losses in recent state polls, the government run by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has announced several stimulus measures for the countryside where millions of farmers are grappling with low crop prices. Other fiscal moves have been aimed at helping small businesses.
The measures are likely to be a drain on finances in Asia's third-biggest economy, though the Modi administration is expected to get the Reserve Bank of India to agree to transfer an interim dividend of 300-400 billion rupees ($4.32 billion-$5.8 billion) to the government by March, Reuters reported last week quoting sources.
Weak consumer spending and the fragile farm sector have already been a drag on economic growth, creating a headache for Modi as he struggles to meet ambitious job creation targets.
India lost 11 million jobs last year, with around 83 percent in rural areas, according to independent think-tank the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, as operational costs surged for small businesses. Those costs were boosted by the launch of a national sales tax in 2017 and the economic impact of an earlier ban on high value currency notes.
""There's a demand, there's a debate - all my colleagues are saying what's the need of keeping the fiscal deficit in check when there is a distress in a particular sector,"" Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a spokesman for the Hindu nationalist BJP, said referring to the farm sector.
""Even think-tanks associated with us are talking in this sense. Very few people domestically are talking about fiscal prudence. Only foreign think-tanks are talking fiscal prudence, fiscal prudence. I strongly believe an expansionary policy can benefit the party.""
Agarwal, a chartered accountant who is a director at state-run Bank of Baroda and a member of a government committee on small and medium-sized businesses, said Modi was aware of his party colleagues' thinking but that no final decision had been taken.
D.S. Malik, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is in the United States for a medical check-up, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Tuesday that India’s ""fiscal discipline during the past five years has been amongst the best as compared to any preceding period"".
NEED TO REACH LANDLESS
Agarwal said the government understands that farmers are in distress and that directly transferring money to their bank accounts was an option to help them out. He said the government was, however, trying to figure out how to distribute funds to landless tillers to make sure any such transfer program was effective and didn't just benefit those with land.
The government is studying a program launched by the eastern state of Odisha under which farmers with landholdings of up to 5 acres would get cash assistance to buy seeds, pesticides, fertilisers and pay for labor. Sharecroppers, who cultivate rented land will also get the benefits, which include life insurance coverage.
Agarwal said Modi and many financial institutions were not in favor of waiving farm loans, as done by states recently won by the main opposition Congress party, because doing so mainly helps banks and not so much farmers in duress.
""There's definitely a suggestion to give interest-free loans to farmers. Banks won't have to pay, it has to be incorporated into the budget,"" he said.
""And what's the so sacrosanct issue about keeping the fiscal deficit at less than 3.5 percent? If you don't adopt an expansionary economic policy, then the government alone can't create demand by just spending on infrastructure. It has to come from both public and the private sector. The economy will grow only when demand will be created.""
He said increasing the income tax exemption limit for individuals was also being considered for the interim budget to be presented on Feb. 1 by Jaitley.
William Foster, vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, said that it expects the country's fiscal deficit to slip to 3.4 of GDP this fiscal year ending March 31 due to revenue shortfalls from goods and services tax, lower excise duty and below-target receipts from sale of government assets.

""Increased expenditure on income transfers, farm loan waivers or other forms of subsidies would weigh further on government finances,"" Foster told Reuters.

AGUA CALIENTE, Guatemala (Reuters) - Several hundred Honduran migrants in a new U.S.-bound caravan crossed into Guatemala on Tuesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump seized on news of the advancing group to try to build support for a wall along his country's border with Mexico.
About 360 Hondurans presented documents to pass legally through the Agua Caliente border crossing separating the two Central American nations. The group included entire families and young men, as well as parents carrying small children.
An additional 350 Hondurans crossed into Guatemalan territory, but were being detained by migration officials checking their documents, according to pro-migrant activists traveling with them.
Some migrants ran toward the port of entry where they were met by a large group of Guatemalan police, and nearly 150 were turned away because they lacked proper documents, police said.
""Those who (lack documents) will be turned back,"" said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's migration authority.
A second group of about 300 Honduran migrants walked along a highway and expected to reach the same border crossing on Tuesday night, activists said, while a smaller group of about 50 migrants had gathered in at a plaza in the capital of El Salvador with the intention of joining up with the caravan.
Earlier on Tuesday, Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Nelly Jerez told reporters that the caravan at the Agua Caliente crossing numbered between 800 and 1,000 people. 
Central American caravans heading toward the United States have inflamed the debate over U.S. immigration policy, with Trump drawing attention to the bedraggled migrants to try to win backing for his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
As a partial U.S. government shutdown reached its 25th day, Trump invoked the new caravan on Twitter to pressure U.S. lawmakers. Democrats have resisted Trump's insistence that Congress provide $5.7 billion for wall funding.
""A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern (NYSE:SO) Border from Honduras,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. ""Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!""
'UNINFORMED'
Trump has described the migrants as an invading force and he sent troops to reinforce the border last year. On Monday, the Pentagon announced it would extend the deployment of about 2,350 troops to the U.S. border through to the end of September. 
Television footage on Tuesday showed mainly younger migrants leaving the notoriously violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. Some flagged down rides, aiming to catch up with the caravan that left the same city on Monday.
""We're asking them to let us cross on our way to Mexico,"" said Honduran migrant Josue Hernandez ahead of the checkpoint guarded by Guatemalan police.
The group will likely face weeks of travel to get to the U.S. border, and many of those persuaded to join the caravan have been misinformed about the likelihood of being able to enter U.S. territory, said the head of Mexico's migration authority.
""They are uninformed about what is happening,"" Tonatiuh Guillen told broadcaster Radio Formula.
""In this context of vulnerability, there are opportunists and a great distortion of reality.""
U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a post on Twitter that her agency was closely monitoring the caravan.
""To be clear - participation in a caravan does not grant you a special status or provide you special treatment,"" she said.
About 2,500 migrants from a previous wave of Central Americans who crossed Mexico have been camping in shelters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana.

The online survey, carried out by Deloitte in November, was completed by 30,364 people from the United Nations and its agencies - just 17 percent of those eligible. In a letter to staff, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the response rate as ""moderately low."" 
""This tells me two things: first - that we still have a long way to go before we are able to fully and openly discuss sexual harassment; and second - that there may also be an ongoing sense of mistrust, perceptions of inaction and lack of accountability,"" he wrote. 
The survey comes amid the wider ""Me Too"" movement around the world against sexual harassment and assault.
According to the report, 21.7 percent of respondents said they were subjected to sexual stories or offensive jokes, 14.2 percent received offensive remarks about their appearance, body or sexual activities and 13 percent were targeted by unwelcome attempts to draw them into a discussion on sexual matters.
Some 10.9 percent said they were subjected to gestures or use of body language of a sexual nature, which embarrassed or offended them, and 10.1 percent were touched in way that made them feel uncomfortable. 
More than half of those experienced sexual harassment said it happened in an office environment, while 17.1 percent said it happened at a work-related social event. Two out of three harassers were male, according to the survey. 
Only one in three people said they took action after experiencing sexual harassment.
Guterres said the report contained ""some sobering statistics and evidence of what needs to change to make a harassment-free workplace real for all of us."" 
""As an organization founded on equality, dignity and human rights, we must lead by example and set the standard,"" he said. 
The United Nations has tried to increase transparency and strengthen how it deals with such accusations over the past few years after a string of sexual exploitation and abuse accusations against U.N. peacekeepers in Africa.

The head of the U.N. agency for HIV and AIDS is also stepping down in June, six months before his term ends, after an independent panel said that his ""defective leadership"" tolerated ""a culture of harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying, and abuse of power.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is closely watching Chinese intentions toward Taiwan, concerned that Beijing's growing military prowess may increase the risk it could one day consider bringing the self-ruled island under its control by force, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.
The senior U.S. defense intelligence official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, did not predict that China's military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA), would take such a step but said such a possibility was the top worry as China expands and modernizes its military capabilities.
""The biggest concern is that ... they are getting to a point where the PLA leadership may actually tell Xi Jinping that they are confident in their capabilities,"" the official said, referring to China's president.
Pressed on whether the official was referring to Chinese confidence in its capabilities to be able to successfully win a battle with Taiwan, the official said, ""Well, specifically that would be the most concerning to me.""
Taiwan is only one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, including a trade war between the countries, U.S. sanctions on the Chinese military, and China's increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea.
However, in meetings with Pentagon leaders, PLA officials have long described Taiwan as China's most sensitive issue.
China has repeatedly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and worked to isolate the island internationally, whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies.
It has also strongly objected to U.S. warship passages through the Taiwan Strait this year, and issued a terse warning about Taiwan after talks in Beijing on Tuesday with the U.S. Navy's top officer, Admiral John Richardson.
'WHATEVER IT TAKES'
In the talks, Chinese General Li Zuocheng, chief of China’s Central Military Commission Joint Staff Department, stressed that Taiwan was ""China's internal affairs"" and that Beijing would allow ""no external interference.""
""If someone tries to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military will do whatever it takes to safeguard national reunification, national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" according to an English-language statement http://eng.mod.gov.cn/news/2019-01/15/content_4834575.htm by China's defense ministry on the talks.
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island’s main source of arms. The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taiwan more than $15 billion in weaponry since 2010.
Xi has stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party became president in 2016.
On Jan. 2, Xi said in a speech that China reserved the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but would strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification.""
Still, the U.S. defense intelligence official cautioned against over-reacting, noting Xi could believe he has plenty of time to achieve reunification with Taiwan.
The official also cautioned that China's military still faced gaps in its capabilities.
""They could order them to go today, but I don't think they're particularly confident in that capability,"" the official said. 
Also on Tuesday, the Defense Intelligence Agency released a report describing Taiwan as the ""primary driver"" for China's military modernization, which it said had made major advances in recent years.
U.S. defense officials have become particularly alarmed about China's advances in super-fast ""hypersonic"" technology, which could allow it to field missiles that are far harder to detect. 

""The result ... is a PLA on the verge of fielding some of the most modern weapon systems in the world. In some areas, it already leads the world,"" the report said http://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1732500/defense-intelligence-agency-releases-report-on-china-military-power.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol are expected to meet on Thursday or Friday in the U.S. capital to discuss a second summit between their leaders, CNN and South Korean media reported citing sources familiar with the issue. 
A meeting could mean the two sides are nearing a compromise after months of standoff over how to move forward in ending North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. 
Kim Yong Chol, along with North Korea's vice foreign minister Choe Son Hui, and a third official, have reservations on a United Airlines flight leaving Beijing on Thursday evening for Washington, Yonhap said on Wednesday, citing an unidentified Chinese airport official. 
A spokesman for the U.S. State Department, asked earlier about the possibility of the top officials from the two sides getting together, said: ""We have no meetings to announce."" 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work towards denuclearization at a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, but there has been little significant progress since. 
Pompeo planned to meet his counterpart last November, but the talks were called off at the last minute.
Contact was resumed after Kim Jong Un delivered a New Year speech in which he said he was willing to meet Trump ""at any time,"" South Korea's ambassador to the United States, Cho Yoon-je, told reporters last week.

Zhao has been accused of failing to act on six sets of instructions from Xi, beginning in 2014, in a case centering on hundreds of luxury villas illegally built in Shaanxi, the financial publication Caixin said.
A television documentary on China's state broadcaster last week showed dramatic images of the sprawling villa complex being leveled to rubble.
It repeatedly criticized the ""main leader of the Shaanxi provincial committee at the time"", but did not directly name Zhao.
It was not possible for Reuters to reach Zhao for comment.
Last March, China overhauled its graft fighting machinery with legislation for a National Supervisory Commission, widening the graft watchdog's power to all state employees and putting its controversial detention and interrogation methods on a legal basis.
Analysts view the reforms as an institutionalization of the fight on graft, embodying a shift in emphasis from rooting out financial graft and Xi's political enemies to enforcing instructions from the top leadership and punishing negligence.
The investigation into Zhao is a ""vivid embodiment"" of the ""overwhelming victory"" in the campaign announced by Xi in December, the CCDI's official publication said on Wednesday.
Zhao is also accused of meddling in a decade-old Shaanxi coal mining dispute spotlighted last month when an influential TV host said that China's Supreme People's Court had lost a document crucial to the case, Caixin said in a lengthy report.
The online post in December by TV host Cui Yongyuan sparked discussion and prompted China's top legal authority, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, to open an investigation into the loss of the document.
In comments carried by official news agency Xinhua in 2013, Xi said it was just as important to go after the ""flies"", or low-ranking officials, as it was to tackle the ""tigers"", or top officials, in the battle on graft.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 10:08PM ET</span>",'El Chapo' paid ex-Mexican president $100 million bribe: trial witness,"By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - Accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman once paid a $100 million bribe to former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, an ex-Guzman associate testified on Tuesday that he previously told U.S. authorities. 
Alex Cifuentes, who has described himself as Guzman's onetime right-hand man, discussed the alleged bribe under cross-examination by Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman's lawyers, in Brooklyn federal court. Asked if he told authorities in 2016 that Guzman arranged the bribe, he answered, ""That's right.""
Reuters could not immediately reach Pena Nieto or his former spokesman for comment. He has previously denied taking bribes.
His former chief of staff, however, took to social media to reject the accusation.
""The declarations of the Colombian drug trafficker in New York are false, defamatory and absurd,"" wrote Francisco Guzman in a post on Twitter, adding that the Pena Nieto government ""located, detained and extradited"" the Mexican kingpin.
The allegations are among the most explosive to emerge from Guzman's trial, which began in November and has so far featured testimony of lower-level corruption. 
Guzman, 61, was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel.
Cifuentes testified that he had told U.S. prosecutors that Pena Nieto initially reached out to Guzman, asking for $250 million. Cifuentes told the prosecutors that the bribe was paid in October 2012, when Pena Nieto was president-elect, he testified.
Cifuentes also said testified that Guzman once told him he had received a message from Pena Nieto saying he did not have to live in hiding anymore.
Lichtman had promised jurors in his opening statement last November they would hear how Mexican drug kingpin Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada bribed Pena Nieto and another former president as part of a scheme to frame Guzman. He said Zambada was the real boss of the cartel.
Pena Nieto at the time called the claim ""completely false and defamatory.""
U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, however, refused to allow Guzman's lawyers to question Zambada's brother about the alleged bribes last year.
It was unclear how Cifuentes' testimony, which appeared to implicate Guzman, could be used to defend him, though Lichtman homed in on inconsistencies in Cifuentes' memory. Cifuentes admitted that at a meeting last year, he told prosecutors he was no longer sure of the exact amounts of the bribes, but did not elaborate.
Pena Nieto was president of Mexico from December 2012 until November 2018. He was once a rising star in Mexico’s long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and was the former governor of the state of Mexico, the country’s most populous.
But the president ended his term a much diminished figure, pummeled by conflict-of-interest scandals, rampant crime and a lackluster economy.
While Pena Nieto himself was barred by law from running for second term in 2018, his centrist party suffered a historic defeat at the polls as leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won in a landslide, relegating the PRI to the role of a marginal player in the new Congress.
Captured by Pena Nieto's government in February 2014, Guzman broke out of prison for a second time some 17 months later, escaping through a mile-long tunnel dug right into in his cell.
The jailbreak humiliated the government and battered the president's already damaged credibility, though Pena Nieto personally announced news of the kingpin's third capture when he was again arrested in northwestern Mexico in January 2016.
Colombian-born Cifuentes is one of about a dozen witnesses who have so far testified against Guzman after striking deals with U.S. prosecutors, in a trial that has provided a window into the secretive world of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world's most powerful drug trafficking organization.

Cifuentes earlier on Tuesday had also testified that Guzman asked an associate to pay a $10 million bribe to a general. The witness said the bribe was never paid and Guzman subsequently ordered the associate killed, though the hit was never carried out.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Gunmen blasted their way into a hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday, killing at least 15 people and sending workers diving under desks to escape an attack claimed by Somalia-based Islamist group al Shabaab.
More than 12 hours after the assault began at Nairobi's upscale 14 Riverside Drive complex, bursts of gunfire and blasts were heard in the area, undermining government assurances everything was under control.
The shots rang out at around 3:30 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) as a group of around 150 workers was escorted from a building where they had sought refuge. Many more remained inside and some needed first aid for gunshot wounds, a first responder told Reuters.
By 1 a.m. local time, 15 bodies had arrived at Chiromo Mortuary and more were expected, an attendant told Reuters. 
Identification papers indicated that 11 were Kenyan, one was American and one was British, he said. The other two were not carrying documents.
A U.S. State Department official confirmed one of the victims was American.
""We can confirm that a U.S. citizen was killed in the attack,"" the official said without giving further details.
Kenya's Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i had said at 11 p.m. that all buildings at the scene had been secured and scores of people evacuated. But he did not comment on the attackers' whereabouts and said security forces were still ""mopping up"". 
Nairobi is a major hub for expatriates and the compound targeted contained offices of various international companies, in an echo of a deadly 2013 assault on a Nairobi shopping center in the same neighborhood. 
""The main door of the hotel was blown open and there was a human arm in the street severed from the shoulder,"" said Serge Medic, the Swiss owner of a security company who ran to the scene to help when he heard of the attack from his taxi driver. 
Medic, who was armed, entered the building with a policeman and two soldiers, he said, but they came under fire and retreated. An unexploded grenade lay in the lobby, he said. 
""One man said he saw two armed men with scarves on their head and bandoliers of bullets,"" Medic told Reuters, as gunfire echoed in the background.
Kenya has often been targeted by al Shabaab, who killed 67 people at the Westgate shopping center in 2013 and nearly 150 students at Garissa University in 2015. Al Shabaab says its attacks are revenge for Kenyan troops stationed inside Somalia, which has been riven by civil war since 1991. 
Earlier in the day, office workers had streamed from the complex, some jumping from windows. Security forces continued to escort small groups to safety into the evening, with some hustled into armored vehicles amid sporadic gunfire. 
Foreign security advisers at the site scrambled to make sure their clients were safe.
GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS
Kenyan police chief Joseph Boinnet said the attack began around 3 p.m. with an explosion targeting cars outside a bank followed by a detonation from a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby. As he spoke, a Reuters reporter on the scene reported heavy gunfire, then an explosion shortly afterwards.
Surveillance video showed three attackers dressed in black running across the parking lot at 3:30 p.m. shortly followed by a fourth. At least two of the men were wearing green scarves in the close-up footage. One appeared to be wearing a green belt with grenades on it.
Two Kenyans in their early 30s working with governance consultants Adam Smith International were among the dead, a family member said. Both had young families, she said.
A Spanish national was among the injured, a Spanish diplomat told Reuters. 
The U.S. Embassy had offered assistance, a State Department official said, adding all American diplomats were safe. 
A woman shot in the leg was carried out of the complex, and several men emerged covered in blood. Some office workers climbed out of windows. Many told Reuters they had to leave colleagues behind, still huddled under their desks. 
""There's a grenade in the bathroom,"" one officer yelled as police rushed out from one building. 
Geoffrey Otieno, who works at a beauty salon in the complex, said he heard a loud bang from something thrown inside the building, then saw shattered glass.
""We hid until we were rescued,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Simon Crump, an Australian who works for an international firm in the complex, barricaded himself inside a spare room with two other people. They waited there for about 2-1/2 hours for help to arrive, their minds racing.
""You’re hiding under a desk trying to figure out what’s going on, and you just don’t know, as there’s so much misinformation,"" he said.
When soldiers finally reached the group, they instructed them to put their phones away and put their hands in the air as they made their way to safety. 
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES
Al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow the weak, United Nations-backed Somali government and impose strict Islamic law, quickly said it was responsible. 
""We are behind the attack in Nairobi. The operation is going on,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group's military operations spokesman, told Reuters by telephone in Somalia. 
According to its website, 14 Riverside is home to local offices of international companies including Colgate Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP),  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and SAP, as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of Thai group Dusit Thani. 
Kenya is a base for hundreds of diplomats, aid workers, businessmen and others operating around East Africa. 
The Australian Embassy is across the road from the compound.
""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives,"" a woman working in a bank in the complex said, adding she heard two explosions. 
Kenyan television featured appeals for blood from local hospitals and showed police cordoning off the route to ensure vehicles could move quickly. Red Cross ambulances ferried victims away.
Kenyan troops, concentrated in southern Somalia, originally entered the country to try to create a buffer zone along the shared border. They now form part of an African Union peacekeeping force.

The attack took place as a Kenyan court prepares to sentence four men accused of aiding the Westgate mall attack.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian authorities evacuated a camp that housed Venezuelan immigrants in the capital of Bogota on Tuesday, dismantling a temporary shelter even as the flow of refugees from the crisis-stricken neighboring nation is expected to continue unabated.
Yellow tents that once housed families were piled into a corner of the football pitch that in November was turned into a temporary shelter for some 600 Venezuelan migrants who had previously been sleeping outside the city's main bus terminal. 
Carmen Nunez, who turned 58 on Tuesday, cried in front of authorities because she had no idea where to go now.
""Should I go to the street?"" she said, with her walking stick in hand. ""I have no money, but I want to go back to Venezuela, at least there I will have a place to stay.""
She was offered transportation to the city of Cucuta on the Venezuelan border, but does not have money to return to her home on the Venezuelan coast. Other migrants stood outside the tightly policed camp entrance with their belongings.
From the outset, Jan. 15 had been set as the camp's closure date, partly in response to pressure from Colombians over the growing presence of migrants. 
The United Nations says some 3 million people have left Venezuela since 2015, seeking an escape from a hyperinflationary economic collapse that has put basic food and medicine beyond the reach of most citizens. 
Another 2 million are likely to emigrate in 2019, it estimates. The vast majority travel by land to Colombia, some on foot, though many continue on to other parts of South America. 
Cristina Velez, Bogota's Secretary of Social Integration, said in a press conference that the city did not plan to open any more shelters unless there were extraordinary circumstances that warranted doing so.
""I have no idea what we're going to do,"" said Junior Palacios, 23, from Caracas, who was sitting outside of the evacuated camp with four friends. 

""I don't want to go back (to Venezuela). It's a question of moving forward and building a life here somehow.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Wednesday to approve the deployment of up to 75 observers to Yemen's port city of Hodeidah for six months to monitor a ceasefire and redeployment of forces by the warring parties, diplomats said.
After a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden last month, the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government foes reached the deal on Hodeidah, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and aid supplies, and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis on the verge of starvation.
The 15-member Security Council last month authorized an advance monitoring team led by retired Dutch General Patrick Cammaert and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to recommended a larger operation. 
The council will vote on Wednesday on a British-drafted resolution that asks Guterres to ""expeditiously"" deploy his recommended larger operation, which will be known as the United Nations Mission to support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA).
The draft resolution also ""requests Member States, particularly neighboring States, to support the United Nations as required for the implementation of UNMHA's mandate.""
A military coalition led by neighboring Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back government forces. The U.N. and Western countries have criticized the coalition for killing a large number of civilians, including children.
The Gulf states accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, a charge Tehran and the group deny.
A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Britain, the United States, Russia, France or China to pass. Diplomats said the Yemen draft is expected to be adopted.
In his Dec. 31 proposal to the council, seen by Reuters, Guterres described the proposed 75-strong team as ""a nimble presence"" to monitor compliance of the deal and establish and assess facts and conditions on the ground.
""Appropriate resources and assets will also be required to ensure the safety and security of U.N. personnel, including armored vehicles, communications infrastructure, aircraft and appropriate medical support,"" Guterres wrote.
""Such resources will be a prerequisite for the effective launch and sustainment of the proposed mission,"" he said.
Guterres said the larger monitoring mission would contribute to sustaining a ""fragile political process"" relaunched by U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths. Griffiths is aiming to convene another round of talks between the warring parties this month.

(Reuters) - The number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America increased in 2017 to the highest level in almost a decade despite an improvement in government social spending policies, a United Nations agency said on Tuesday.
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said the proportion of people in extreme poverty, which is characterized by lack of access to basic human necessities like food and shelter, rose to 10.2 percent of the population in 2017, or 62 million people, from 9.9 percent in 2016.
The figure is the highest since 2008 and largely due to an economic deterioration in Brazil, which has only begun to rebound in the last year from its worst recession in decades. Brazil has about 200 million people, making it Latin America's most populous nation. 
""We had years of very low economic growth and the impact has been mostly in unemployment,"" Alicia Bárcena, executive secretary of ECLAC, told Reuters in Santiago, Chile. 
Poverty on a more generalized basis declined in Chile, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic from 2012 to 2017, largely due to an increase in work income.

But conditions worsened in Brazil, with extreme poverty rising to 5.5 percent of the population in 2017, from 5.1 percent in the previous year, ECLAC said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Amid threats to the safety of Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed, who was granted asylum in Canada, the Toronto agency helping her has hired a security guard to ensure ""she is never alone"" as she starts a normal life, its executive director said on Tuesday.
Mohammed, 18, made international headlines after she barricaded herself in an airport hotel room in Thailand's capital Bangkok to avoid being sent home to her family due to fears of being harmed or killed. The family denies any abuse. 
The teen has received multiple threats online that have made her fear for her safety, said Mario Calla, executive director of Costi, a refugee agency contracted by the Canadian government to help her settle in Toronto. 
Costi has hired a security guard and plans to ""make sure she is never alone,"" Calla told reporters. ""It's hard to say how serious these threats are. We're taking them seriously.""
Mohammed, who has renounced her family name al-Qunun, gave a public statement in Toronto on Tuesday that was read on her behalf in English by a settlement worker.
""I understand that everyone here and around the world wishes me well and would like to continue to hear about how I am doing, but ... I would like to start living a normal private life, just like any other young woman living in Canada,"" she said in the statement read by Saba Abbas. 
Canada's agreement to take Mohammed comes at a delicate time for Canada-Saudi relations. Last year the kingdom froze all new investment with Canada after foreign minister Chrystia Freeland called for the immediate release of jailed rights activists.
So when Freeland welcomed Mohammed at the Toronto airport in person, some critics argued that might have further provoked Saudi authorities.
But Freeland told reporters Tuesday she did what she would have wanted for her own daughter. 
""I imagined it would be a difficult and perhaps frightening moment and it might make a difference for her personally to feel she had the personal and welcome support of our government."" 
Mohammed thanked the Canadian and Thai governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for making her move to Canada possible. 

""I am one of the lucky ones,"" she said. ""I know that there are unlucky women who disappeared after trying to escape or who could not do anything to change their reality.""

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",How Trump slowed rush for Syria exits after huddle in Iraq,"By Steve Holland, Phil Stewart and Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was reeling from sharp rebukes at home and abroad over his surprise announcement last month to immediately pull American troops out of Syria when he flew into the al Asad airbase in neighboring Iraq the day after Christmas.
Inside a canvas Quonset hut, one of the arced prefabricated structures used by the military and surrounded by concertina wire, Trump received operational briefs from U.S. commanders suggesting a territorial victory against Islamic State was within sight, but the military needed just a bit more time, U.S. officials said.
""They were upbeat about their ability to wrap things up,"" one of the officials told Reuters. ""I definitely think that was a seminal meeting"" in terms of influencing Trump's thinking.
(Graphic: Islamic State in Syria and Iraq control zones - https://tmsnrt.rs/2S9TGpu)
Lieutenant General Paul LaCamera, the commander of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, explained to a president who had lost patience with the war why too rapid a withdrawal could not be done without putting troops at risk, according to three officials familiar with the briefing, the contents of which have not been reported in such detail.
In the chaotic aftermath of Trump's Dec. 19 announcement, which was one of the reasons that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned, the 45-minute briefing appears to have helped crystallize an understanding between Trump and his top brass on the ground. Trump, in remarks to reporters, admitted that he felt better about the situation after talking to commanders in the theater instead of officials in Washington.
The briefing also helped win the U.S. military and diplomats some breathing room to plan a more deliberate exit from Syria.
It was a novel experience for the president, who was making his first visit to a war zone in his nearly two years in office, fresh from a political pummeling over his decision on Syria from fellow Republicans in Congress and U.S. allies. 
    Nearly three weeks after the briefing, no troops have withdrawn from Syria and only some equipment has moved out.
In 2015, then-President Barack Obama first ordered U.S. special operations forces into Syria after long hesitating to deploy ""boots on the ground"" in the midst of the Syrian civil war. What started off as a mission involving dozens of commandos eventually turned into hundreds and then just kept growing. There are about 2,000 U.S. forces in Syria today.
Although Trump initially announced plans for a speedy pullout, he has since said it does not need to go quickly. 
""We are pulling back in Syria, we are going to be removing our troops, I never said we are doing it that quickly,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 6.
In fact, Trump said on Dec. 19 that American troops were coming home ""now"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGw7ZOGPr8w&feature=youtu.be and they had already defeated Islamic State in Syria. No experts believe Islamic State has been defeated, despite the group having lost almost all of the territory it held in 2014 and 2015 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq and declaring a ""caliphate.""
The Pentagon said on Friday that the withdrawal ""is not subject to an arbitrary timeline,"" and would take into account conditions on the ground and talks with allies. 
Trump's concession of additional time has set off an apparent scramble by the U.S. military and Trump administration officials to accomplish as much as possible in the twilight of the Syria campaign.
U.S. officials tell Reuters that planning for a complete withdrawal from Syria is still underway, despite confusing and sometimes contradictory statements from the White House and tension with Turkey, which was meant to take over the campaign against Islamic State. 
Several officials said they expected a withdrawal before the end of March, but would not commit to a date, given fast-evolving policy discussions and hard-to-predict battlefield developments.
FINAL BLOWS
Privately, some U.S. officials worry the final push will not be enough to preserve hard-won gains against Islamic State or ensure protection for U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG allies who helped in the fight. NATO ally Turkey views Kurdish militia as terrorists, an extension of a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.
Trump himself acknowledged his concerns for the Kurds on Monday, warning Turkey of ""economic devastation"" if it attacks a U.S.-allied Kurdish militia in Syria. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Trump was referring to sanctions.
According to U.S. estimates, Islamic State oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under its control. The group had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year and used its de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria as a base to plot attacks in Europe.
Backed up by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, artillery and advisers and equipment, U.S.-supported ground forces in Iraq and Syria clawed back towns and cities from the jihadists. Iraq declared victory against the group in 2017. 
U.S. military officials are reluctant to predict how quickly Islamic State militants can be vanquished from their final towns in Syria, recalling how the insurgents fought until the death in Mosul, Iraq. The group still influences about 300 square kilometers in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, according to the U.S.-led coalition.
The persistence of the group was one of the reasons that Trump's decision stunned the Pentagon. 
But after the initial shock, military and civilians leaders including Mattis met at the Pentagon the week before Christmas to discuss the quickest, safest and most responsible way they could carry out the troop pullout and protect Kurdish allies.
It became clear that a rapid 30-day withdrawal, as initially suggested by the White House, would not meet the criteria of a ""safe and responsible"" withdrawal. Before Trump's surprise decision, Pentagon planning had suggested four months would be needed.
One source played down Trump's concerns about whether the drawdown would be done in weeks or months.
""All he wants to know is that it is happening,"" the source said.
Significantly, Mattis' order issued before Christmas did not include a specific timeline, although U.S. officials said military commanders told the White House that a safe and responsible drawdown could not be done in less than 120 days. The order has not been changed since Mattis left office on Dec. 31, when his deputy Patrick Shanahan took over, officials said. 
In the meantime, the U.S.-backed forces in Syria, including Kurds, are keeping up the fight - confounding analysts' predictions that they would rapidly head north to prepare for an offensive by Turkey.
In fact, since Trump's withdrawal announcement, those forces have been fighting Islamic State with support from U.S.-led coalition air strikes and artillery. 
U.S. allies, who were caught entirely off-guard by Trump's announcement, are still seeking clarification about the timing of America's exit. 
The troop pullout from Syria dominated discussions by Pompeo during his meetings in Amman, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Iraq over the past week, in which he told U.S. allies that a withdrawal was a tactical change only.
Allies also want information about any post-withdrawal role by the U.S. military to ensure Islamic State militants do not rise from the ashes of their caliphate, U.S. officials and diplomats said.
But they appear relieved at the apparent slowdown of the pullout. 

""It seems that there has been a change that I think is positive,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian of France said last week.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",Venezuela Congress declares President Maduro 'usurper' of democracy,"By Mayela Armas and Corina Pons
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition-run Congress on Tuesday formally declared President Nicolas Maduro a ""usurper,"" whose actions would be considered null and void after he was sworn in last week for a disputed second term.
U.S. President Donald Trump is considering recognizing the leader of the Congress, Juan Guaido, as Venezuela's legitimate president, CNN reported, citing three unidentified sources. 
Maduro was inaugurated on Jan. 10 under an avalanche of criticism that his leadership was illegitimate following a 2018 election widely viewed as fraudulent, with countries around the world disavowing his government.
The United States and many Latin American nations say Maduro has become a dictator whose failed state-led policies have plunged Venezuela into its worst ever economic crisis, with no recovery in sight. Maduro says that a U.S.-directed ""economic war"" is trying to force him from power.
""Today Congress declares that at this time there is no president of the republic,"" Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator, said in a speech. ""Let's start the process to recover the constitutional order,"" he said.
Congress also approved a measure asking dozens of foreign governments to freeze bank accounts controlled by Maduro's government.
The measure calls on the United States, European Union and several Latin American governments to instruct regulatory agencies to ""prohibit any movement of liquid assets by the Venezuelan state in local bank accounts.""
The United States and EU have already imposed sanctions that limit the sale of Venezuelan government debt and freeze assets belonging to Maduro and a number of his top officials.
The pro-government Supreme Court, which has been in conflict with the legislature since the opposition took Congress over in 2016, has preemptively invalidated any laws passed by the body.
U.S. CONSIDERS OPTIONS 
A White House spokesman, asked if further sanctions were in the pipeline, said the United States was considering ""all diplomatic, political, and economic tools in its arsenal in response to the usurpation of power by the illegitimate Maduro regime.""
In response to a request for comment on the CNN report, the spokesman said: ""The United States has expressed its support for Juan Guaido, who as president of the democratically-elected National Assembly has courageously declared his constitutional authority to ... call for free and fair elections.""
Last week, Guaido said he was willing to replace Maduro if he had the support of the military. Several government officials have said he should be arrested for treason and on Sunday he was briefly detained by intelligence agents.
In Washington, a person familiar with the matter said any U.S. decision to recognize Guaido would be complicated by the fact that he has not declared himself president or even stated an intention to do so. 
Such a move by the Trump administration could also backfire if Maduro took action to prevent Guaido from being sworn in or used it as a pretext to detain him again.
Diosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative superbody elected in 2017 that gives the ruling Socialist Party sweeping powers, said that the opposition in Congress were ""the only ones trying to usurp power.""
""They've spent 20 years trying to force us from government,"" Cabello told a news conference.

Lawmakers are also discussing a future amnesty for government officials and military officers who reject Maduro and help bring about a return to democracy. The measures are unlikely to be enforced in the short term.

Piotr Durbajlo, who was working for Orange Polska at the time of his arrest on Jan. 10, had previously worked for Poland's Internal Security Agency and the Office of Electronic Communications, among other state institutions between 2000 and 2017, according to a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile in his name. 
Spokespeople from Poland's national prosecutor's office and security services declined to comment on the Journal's report when contacted by Reuters. Reuters was not able immediately to determine the identity of Durbajlo's lawyers.
On Jan. 11, officials said Durbajlo was arrested along with Chinese national Weijing Wang, an executive of telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, on allegations of spying, in a move that fuels Western security concerns about the Chinese company. The officials did not disclose details of the alleged espionage. 
Both men heard charges in a Polish court last week.
Poland's government could consider limiting the use of Huawei products by public bodies in the wake of the arrests, a government official told Reuters on Sunday.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecommunications equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and U.S.-led allegations that its devices could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the accusations, but several Western countries have restricted Huawei's access to their markets.

Hours later, in an apparent bid to ease tension, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland spoke of the ""very important and long-standing ties"" between the two nations.
The countries have been at odds since early December, when Canadian police arrested Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], on a U.S. extradition request as part of an investigation into suspected violations of U.S. trade sanctions.
Days later, China detained two Canadians on suspicion of endangering state security.
Monday's death sentence for Canadian Robert Schellenberg for smuggling 222 kg of methamphetamines became the latest strain on ties.
Freeland said Ottawa had formally applied for clemency for Schellenberg, as it usually does in the cases of citizens condemned to death abroad.
""It's normal to have problems but we should also remember that the links between our two countries are very big,"" she told a televised news conference in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, adding Canada had been in touch with Beijing at a number of levels.
""It is true that this is a difficult moment ... The best thing for both Canada and China, and frankly for the whole world, is to get past these current difficulties.""
Freeland's office did not respond when asked whether she had been trying to defuse tensions with Beijing.
China has not linked any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released.
Trudeau said it should be of ""extreme concern"" to Canada's allies, as it was to his government, that China had chosen to ""arbitrarily apply"" the death penalty. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with that.
""The remarks by the relevant Canadian person lack the most basic awareness of the legal system,"" Hua told reporters.
Taking Canada to task for issuing an updated travel advisory warning citizens about the risk of arbitrary enforcement of laws in China, Hua said Canada should instead remind its people to avoid drug smuggling.
""We urge the Canadian side to respect the rule of law, respect China's legal sovereignty, correct its mistakes, and stop making irresponsible remarks,"" Hua said.
The ministry later issued its own travel warning, citing the ""arbitrary detention"" of a Chinese national in Canada.
""NO NEW EVIDENCE""
Schellenberg had appealed against an original 15-year prison sentence issued in November, but the court in Liaoning province sided with prosecutors at the retrial that the punishment was too light.
A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, said his client would appeal.
Freeland said she had spoken to Schellenberg's father on Monday, adding it had been ""a very emotional conversation for him"". She gave no details.
Zhang said there was insufficient evidence to prove Schellenberg was part of a drug syndicate, or that he was involved in smuggling methamphetamines.
Even if the court accepted all the charges, it should not have increased his sentence, given that facts the prosecution gave as new evidence had already been heard, he told Reuters.
""Chinese law stipulates that during an appeal, only if new evidence is discovered and retried can there be an increase in the severity of a sentence,"" Zhang said.
Schellenberg was arrested in 2014.
Asked about the case, the United Nations noted its opposition to the death penalty apart from exceptional circumstances.
""The bottom line is that the death penalty shouldn't be imposed for any crime other than intentional killing,"" said U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville.
Asked whether it had concerns about due process, he said: ""In China there is generally a problem of lack of transparency in trials.""
Chinese state media has played up coverage of Schellenberg's case following the deterioration in relations with Canada. 
Drug smuggling is punished severely in China, and foreigners convicted of drug crimes have been executed before, including a Briton in 2009.

Schellenberg had faced a number of charges in Canada related to drug possession and trafficking, according to court records. But international rights groups condemned Schellenberg's sentence, with some saying it was too severe and may have been politically motivated.

Highlighting the threat posed by returning Islamist fighters, Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, faces life in prison over the shooting in May 2014 after returning from the war in Syria.
Nemmouche has admitted to carrying a Kalashnikov, a revolver and ammunition similar to that used in the shooting, weaponry that was displayed in the court room on Tuesday.
His lawyer, however, told the jury that he did not pull the trigger in the attack that killed an Israeli couple and two museum staff, Belgian public broadcaster RTBF said.
His defense lawyer alleged the camera footage of the shooting used by prosecutors was faked and blamed the shooting on Israel's Mossad spy agency.
Nemmouche, who appeared alongside his alleged accomplice in court, said he would not take the stand because witnesses who could have spoken in his favor were not allowed to appear.
Investigators say it is the first trial over an attack staged by a Western European returned from fighting in Syria. 
A group of French journalists kidnapped and held hostage by the Islamic State have identified Nemmouche as one of their jailers and accused him of torture.
They also named as one of their guards Belgian Najim Laachraoui, who investigators say built the suicide vests used in the 2015 Paris attack and was one of two suicide bombers who attacked Brussels airport four months later.

Tracking such battle-hardened fighters is of paramount concern to Western counter-terrorism officials. Of more than 5,000 Europeans - most from Britain, France, Germany and Belgium - who joined the ranks of fighters in Syria and Iraq, some 1,500 have returned and 1,000 were killed, according to Europol.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>",Italian fugitives shouldn't be 'drinking champagne' in France: Salvini,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini urged French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday to extradite leftist guerrillas who have been hiding out in France for decades to avoid serving prison sentences in Italy.
""I appeal to the French president to return to Italy the fugitives that should not be drinking champagne under the Eiffel tower, but should be rotting in jail in Italy,"" Salvini said in an interview with Canale 5 TV.
Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, spoke a day after the return of communist militant Cesare Battisti to Italy from Bolivia to serve a life sentence for his involvement in four murders in the late 1970s.
Battisti, who escaped prison in 1981, had spent more than 15 years in France before fleeing to South America.
There are nine Italian leftist fugitives living in France, according to Rome's la Repubblica newspaper, including three convicted for playing a role in the 1978 kidnapping of former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro.
Macron's office had no comment, but a French justice ministry spokesman said there was no detailed list of Italian fugitives now living in the country.
""Extradition requests received by the Italian authorities in the coming days will be analyzed in detail, on a case-by-case basis, as has been the case for the last 15 years or so,"" the spokesman said.
Former French President Francois Mitterrand established what came to be known as the ""Mitterrand doctrine"" in the mid-1980s, a policy that shielded the militants from extradition because Mitterrand said the Italian justice system was stacked against them. The doctrine was abandoned in the early 2000s.
Italy's new populist government has regularly criticized Macron over his immigration policy and other issues, casting him as a symbol of the pro-European Union establishment. 

Macron in turn said in June that the Italian government's brand of populism was like ""leprosy"" spreading across Europe and should be fought.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","Launching national debate, Macron makes another faux pas about the poor","GRAND-BOURGTHEROULDE, France (Reuters) - France's Emmanuel Macron began a national debate on Tuesday meant to calm protests against high living costs, but he may have started on the wrong foot by suggesting some poor people were ""screwing"" with the system. 
The president paid a surprise visit to a village in Normandy on his way to what was the first of thousands of debates that officials across the country will hold in an effort to quell ""yellow vest"" protests that have wrought havoc nationwide.
Under pressure to appear more humble after previous sharp remarks, Macron nonetheless infuriated critics with comments they said were disparaging to the poor.
""For people who are struggling, we will make them more aware of their responsibilities, because some of them are behaving properly, while others are screwing about,"" Macron told local councillors in the village of Gasny.
Macron struck a more appeasing tone in the town hall meeting, saying the yellow-vest movement was an opportunity for the country and conceding he should adopt a more inclusive governing style. But political rivals said the damage was done.
""This remark will shock the French, it is unacceptable. The president should not speak this way,"" Daniel Fasquelle, a lawmaker for the conservative Republicans party told Reuters.
Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialist party, said: ""The way he always bowls the same ball and suggests the poor are milking the system is unbearable.""
It is the second time in two weeks Macron has been accused of adding fuel to the fire. On Friday, he said too many French people thought ""one can get something without any effort"".
The debate with 600 mayors in the town of Grand-Bourgtheroulde was the first of a two-month ""great debate"" - a series of town hall meetings for local people to air their views.

Asked by one mayor whether he regretted some of his remarks, citing his comment about how unemployed people can often just ""cross the road"" to get a job, Macron replied: ""That's how I am, I'm not going to change.""

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Taliban threatens to pull out of peace talks with U.S.,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban on Tuesday threatened to stall peace talks with the United States if they deflect from the issue of foreign force withdrawal from Afghanistan, a key demand of the hardline Islamic militants to end the 17-year war.
In a statement, the Taliban said America must pursue the peace talks with ""sincere intentions"" or it ""will be forced to stall all talks and negotiations until America ends her unlawful pressures and maneuvering and steps forward toward true peace.""
The warning comes a day after Taliban fighters blew up a car-bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in Kabul city.
Last week senior leaders of the Taliban canceled the fourth round of peace talks with Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan over an ""agenda disagreement.""
Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Tuesday after meeting officials in India, the United Arab Emirates and China, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said. 
The Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Kabul was named to oversee Washington's peace efforts last year. He has met with the Taliban leaders at least three times to discuss foreign troop withdrawal and a timeline for a ceasefire.
The United States has also insisted that any final settlement must be led by Afghans themselves.
""The U.S. goal is to promote dialogue among Afghans about how to end the conflict, and to encourage the parties to come together at the negotiating table to reach a political settlement in which every Afghan citizen enjoys equal rights and responsibilities under the rule of law,"" the embassy said in a statement.
But the leaders of the insurgent group have rejected requests from the United States and regional powers to deal directly with the government in Kabul, which it considers an illegitimate foreign-imposed regime.
The Taliban has been pushing to shift the venue for the talks from Saudi Arabia to Qatar in an attempt to fend off Riyadh's bid to include the Afghan government in them.
The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, insist that the United States is their main adversary in the war and demand bilateral talks. 

""The United States agreed during the Doha meeting in the month of November 2018 about discussing the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the upcoming meeting,"" the Taliban said. The United States ""is now backing away from that agenda and is unilaterally adding new subjects.""

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Accused Albanian drug lord surrenders to police,"TIRANA (Reuters) - One of Albania's most wanted drug traffickers surrendered to police on Tuesday after almost three years on the run on charges of smuggling narcotics by neighboring Greece.
Klement Balili had avoided capture since May, 2016 thanks to his network of support in the southern coastal area of Sarande and alleged political ties, casting doubt on NATO member Albania's resolve to fight big crime bosses.
In February, 2017, pressure from its Western allies forced Albania to convene its security council to make Balili's seizure a priority since his drug ring had spread to the territory of neighboring countries and NATO allies.
Interior Minister Sander Lleshaj told reporters Balili's arrest meant Albanian police, who had mounted more than a dozen failed operations to catch him, had made an ""historic leap"" in overcoming their ""mindset failure"" to catch big crime bosses.
""His surrender was the result of a deep, wide and complex operation in cooperation with Albania's partners,"" Lleshaj said.
Asked what Balili had been offered to get him to surrender, Lleshaj said: ""The assurance of a fair legal process.""
Constant appeals by former U.S. Ambassador Donald Lu to catch Balili pushed Prime Minister Edi Rama to call on police to make sure he was in custody before Lu's replacement arrived.
Balili denied any involvement and appeared publicly when Greek police, working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, accused him of transporting 700 kilos of cannabis into Greece. He was soon on the run, however.
Balili's Greek lawyer alleged that Greece had built a case against him out of thin air and his Albanian lawyer Theodhori Sollaku said on Tuesday that the evidence was dubious.
The 48-year-old Balili had headed the road-building and transport department of Sarande, where he also owned a seaside luxury hotel and had a stake in another, until early 2016.
He had political ties with the Socialist Integration Movement (SIM) party, which was a junior partner in the ruling coalition led by the Socialist Party from 2013-17, when Rama ditched them to win a mandate without allies.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Scotland's Sturgeon under fire on handling of Salmond harassment case,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scottish lawmakers will launch an inquiry into whether First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's pro-independence government has been even-handed in how it has treated sex harassment allegations against her mentor and predecessor Alex Salmond, political parties said on Tuesday.
The case, which has set the two most popular figures in Scottish nationalist politics against one another, has raised questions about Sturgeon's judgment and what she knew and when regarding the accusations. 
Salmond denies wrongdoing and the case is currently being investigated by police. 
Some political observers believe the spat could weaken Sturgeon's leadership and further complicate the prospects of any fresh Scottish independence campaign as Britain's exit from the European Union is played out.
On Monday, a Sturgeon adviser complained of an attempt to smear her. Salmond, who lost his parliamentary seat in last year's election, said last week there were forces trying to destroy him because he is a ""political threat."" Media reports have spoken of civil war in the Scottish National Party (SNP), Scotland's biggest party.
Salmond, who led an unsuccessful independence campaign which nevertheless bolstered the SNP in 2014, has denied any criminal conduct after being accused of sexually assaulting two members of staff at his official residence in 2013 while he held office as first minister.
Sturgeon has been criticized by political opponents for not immediately reporting to civil servants the first two of five meetings and telephone conversations she had with him after the investigation was launched last year. 
Sturgeon has referred herself to a panel of independent advisers on ministerial code over the issue.
She said on Sunday she had acted appropriately and in good faith but added: ""I have reflected carefully and understand that it is also important for Parliament and the wider public to be assured of that.""
A former adviser to both Sturgeon and Salmond used a Sunday Times column this week to call for bold action to restore the credibility of the devolved Scottish government, which has wide powers over health, education and a portion of taxes. 
""We need to understand everything that went wrong in the Salmond case if the deeper damage is to be mended,"" Kevin Pringle wrote. ""Otherwise, generalised claims of government incompetence will be more likely to stick.""

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Iran could enrich uranium to 20 percent within four days: atomic chief,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran can enrich uranium up to 20 percent within four days, its atomic energy chief said on Tuesday, a comment apparently aimed at showing Tehran could quickly expand its enrichment program if its nuclear deal with world powers collapses.
Iran’s 2015 accord with world powers caps the level to which it is able to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent purity, well below the 20 percent it was reaching before the deal, and the roughly 90 percent suitable for a nuclear weapon.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal last May, calling it flawed, and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tehran refuses to renegotiate and has said the deal could fall apart unless European signatories preserve its economic benefits for the Islamic Republic against U.S. pressure.
“If we want to come out of the nuclear deal and produce, within four days we could start our 20 percent,” Ali Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told the semi-official Fars News Agency. “But we already have stockpiles of 20 percent, and the capability.”
Salehi did not elaborate on his remark about stockpiles. Iran's reserve of 20 percent enriched uranium was downblended, shipped abroad or turned into fuel plates for a research reactor after the nuclear deal was clinched.    
Salehi told Reuters in an interview last November that Iran could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity - seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants - if the 2015 deal's trade spin-offs do not pan out for Tehran.

Iran is allowed under the deal to produce nuclear fuel under strict conditions that need to be approved by a working group set up by the signatories. Those conditions include ensuring that the fuel cannot be converted to uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges that enrich uranium.

Political sources have suggested the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which dominates parliament, might not approve the budget in order to trigger an election in March. National elections are due in the autumn, but moving them earlier could give PiS a better chance of winning. 
""Today we have a sitting of the finance panel that is to discuss 100 amendments to the budget and tomorrow ... voting on the budget in the lower house of parliament is planned,"" Janusz Szewczak, who is also a PiS MP, told Reuters on Tuesday.
He dismissed talk of an early election.
Parliament must pass the budget by the end of January. If it does not, the president, who is a PiS ally, could call an early election.
Some opposition politicians have said that PiS might seek to call a national election ahead of European elections in May that it fears may galvanize voters opposed to the nationalist ruling party, especially in urban areas. A good result for the opposition in European polls would also give it more control over the political narrative in Poland ahead of the election.
PiS has faced EU criticism over reforms to the rule of law that opponents say tilt towards authoritarianism but has recently softened its tone towards the EU, which a recent Eurostat poll showed 70 percent of Poles want to remain part of. 
An opinion poll published on Sunday by Polish tabloid Super Express showed PiS would win 37 percent of the vote if national elections were held now, well ahead of the opposition.
The fatal stabbing of the staunchly anti-PiS mayor of Gdansk, Pawel Adamowicz, at the weekend may engage more young voters in politics, however, a senior opposition source said. 
That could boost more liberal parties. 
""I think that my generation will become active now, it is visible in social media -- everyone reacts, supports each other,"" a 20-year-old student Beata Dawidowicz told Reuters on Monday at a commemoration of Adamowicz's death in Gdansk.
""The political scene will change a lot. My colleagues, who have different views on politics, my whole generation, agrees that this (stabbing) is unacceptable,"" she said.
Poland's former Prime Minister Marek Belka told private Radio Zet that chances for early elections have fallen significantly in these circumstances.
""There was a lot of talk about early general elections. What happened on Sunday takes this issue off the table. You can't conduct an election campaign in such an atmosphere,"" he said.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's military put on a show of force to deter further unrest on Tuesday after at least three deaths in violent protests over steep fuel price hikes, but continuing disorder blocked the flow of key supplies into the country.
Zimbabweans accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa of failing to live up to pre-election pledges to kick-start growth, having seen their purchasing power eroded by hyper-inflation, and of resorting to armed forces to crush dissent like strongman predecessor Robert Mugabe. 
Mnangagwa has promised a clean break from the 37-year era of Mugabe, who was forced out in a de facto coup in November 2017. But residents said the army was beating up suspected protesters in various townships.
""We are suffering. Mnangagwa has failed this country. Enough is enough, we no longer want this,"" protester Takura Gomba said in Warren Park, a Harare township, while retreating with others as soldiers approached in trucks. 
Amnesty International condemned the military crackdown, saying at least 200 people had been arbitrarily detained and calling on Zimbabwean authorities to ensure restraint by security forces and respect the public's right to protest.
Monday's street disturbances followed sharp increases in fuel prices decreed by Mnangagwa, five months after post-election violence during which six people died when the army intervened to quell trouble. 
As security forces faced accusations of heavy-handedness and more protests threatened to break out, Labour Minister Sekai Nzenza announced that public workers would get a monthly supplement of between 5 and 23 percent of their salaries from January to March while wage negotiations with unions continued.
Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba told reporters that a police officer was stoned to death by protesters in Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayo on Monday, while two other people died during protests in Chitungwiza, south of Harare, and Kadoma, west of the capital.
Mnangagwa, who is on an official visit in Moscow, said Zimbabwe was interested in receiving Russian loans and might need Moscow's help in modernizing its army, RIA news agency reported. 
BUSINESSES, PUBLIC SERVICES SHUT DOWN
In Harare and Bulawayo, banks, schools, businesses and the stock market remained shut as many residents stayed at home. 
A human rights lawyers' group said it had received reports of soldiers and police breaking into homes in townships overnight and assaulting suspected demonstrators.
Security forces deployed in population centers to stave off further demonstrations, witnesses said, and people in Harare said they could no longer access the internet. 
Amnesty, in a statement, said the internet was cut off to prevent people from supporting or organizing protests while critics said the government sought to prevent images of its heavyhandedness from being broadcast around the world. 
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said she was not aware of an internet shutdown.
Reports of violent disorder prompted southern African bus lines to suspend services into Zimbabwe, interrupting the flow of goods into Zimbabwe from the diaspora in adjacent countries. 
""We can't proceed because they are saying things are tough there. Buses are being burned. Roads are blocked. It's a total shutdown,"" said Alexio Chirisa. He had been driving a bus full of passengers from the South African city of Port Elizabeth to Harare but was forced to park in Johannesburg on Tuesday. 
With Zimbabwe's banks strapped for cash, shipping essential daily commodities like rice and cooking oil to families from their relatives abroad has become a favored alternative to cash remittances. 

""Years of political and economic mismanagement has brought Zimbabwe’s economy to its knees. Millions of Zimbabweans are terrified about the knock-on effects that the fuel increases will have on their daily lives, including for food and healthcare,"" said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Southern (NYSE:SO) Africa.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>",Saudi aide fired over Khashoggi murder still wields influence: sources,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Saudi royal advisor fired over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi continues to wield influence in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's inner circle, according to Western, Arab and Saudi sources with links to the royal court.
Saud al-Qahtani was dismissed as a top aide to the de facto Saudi leader in late October, after overseeing the operation to kill Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by giving orders via Skype, according to regional intelligence sources.
A senior Saudi official at the time called his removal ""a political decision ... based on dereliction of duty and participation in the sequence of events"" that led to the murder. Weeks later, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Qahtani for his role.
But six sources told Reuters that Qahtani remains active on behalf of the royal court. Two of them said he has kept in touch with the crown prince while three others said he has continued to instruct a small group of Saudi journalists on what to write about the kingdom's policies.
As head of the royal court's media center until his dismissal, Qahtani ran an electronic media army tasked with protecting Saudi Arabia's image, dictating the official line on issues from a dispute with Qatar to security and human rights. 
The apparent impunity of Qahtani, seen as the crown prince's right-hand man, risks undermining Saudi promises to hold those responsible to account, the sources say. The U.S. Senate last month backed a resolution blaming the crown prince, known as MbS, for the killing and insisted Riyadh fully investigate.
A Saudi official denied Qahtani was still playing a role inside the royal court, saying he has not conducted any work since his dismissal and that he remains under investigation and banned from travel.
The official referred Reuters to comments by the public prosecutor's spokesman last year that 21 Saudis were taken into custody in relation to the Khashoggi case, 11 of whom have been indicted and referred to trial.
Reuters has been unable to reach Qahtani since he was fired.
""FREE AND IN FAVOR""
At the heart of the crown prince's inner circle, Qahtani controlled access to MbS and would often speak on his behalf before he was dismissed, government insiders have said.
No official replacement has yet been announced. 
Qahtani has continued to make repeated appearances at the royal court, although it was not clear in what capacity, five of the sources said. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.
""He is still around, free and in favor. The crown prince is still holding on to him and doesn't seem to be willing to sacrifice him,"" one of the foreign sources said.
MbS himself has told visitors that Qahtani is still an advisor while assuring them that some responsibilities have been taken from him, according to a source familiar with the discussion between the crown prince and the visitors. The source did not elaborate.
Qahtani has also continued to dictate the royal court's official line to columnists and top editors he considers able to influence public opinion, according to three of the sources, despite leaving a WhatsApp group he ran for that purpose.
Instead he has messaged individuals directly, instructing them on what or what not to write, these sources said.
LYING LOW
Qahtani's involvement in Khashoggi's murder, which intelligence sources have said included giving orders over Skype to the team inside the consulate, has fueled speculation that MbS ordered the hit. Saudi officials have said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.
The public prosecutor has said Qahtani briefed a team of Saudi operatives ahead of a mission to repatriate Khashoggi. Saudi officials have refused to disclose whether Qahtani was among those arrested.
The Saudi public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects detained over Khashoggi's killing and a first court hearing was held this month. The suspects were not named and Reuters could not determine whether Qahtani was present at the hearing.
A source familiar with U.S. government agencies' reporting and analyses said they believe Qahtani has been instructed to lie low for a while but think it is unlikely that MbS would ditch Qahtani. 
Some Western allies had been concerned, even before Khashoggi's killing, by the power Qahtani wielded within the royal court and have privately urged Riyadh to replace him with more seasoned advisers, according to Western diplomats in Riyadh. 
Qahtani stopped using Twitter, a platform he regularly used to attack the kingdom's critics, on Oct. 23 and changed the biography on his profile to ""personal account"".
But Saudi activists living abroad still see his influence on Saudi media and in the Twitter attacks they say they face, accusing them of being disloyal to MbS or unpatriotic for not supporting his policies.

""Nothing has changed. It seems to have the same line, the same offensive language. His fingerprints are all over it still,"" said Hala al-Dosari, a Saudi scholar and activist based in the United States.

Between 60 and 70 percent of medicines on the Irish market either come from, or transit through the United Kingdom and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a working group of health officials has been meeting weekly for the last two years to examine any potential supply disruptions.
""They have decided against stockpiling, their advice is stockpiling itself may actually cause a break in supply but they are working very closely with the pharmaceutical industry and the main wholesalers to make sure there is an adequate supply,"" Varadkar told parliament.
""They have identified a watch list of about 24 medicines that we would be most concerned about.""
For its part, Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) last year ordered the country's main drug industry associations to gather information on the effect of a no-deal Brexit. 
""For BfArm, the analysis has led to the conclusion that no shortages of medicines that are deemed critical are to be expected,"" the watchdog said on its website. 
More than 2,600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the UK to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.
The British government has asked UK drugmakers to build an additional six weeks of medicine stockpiles to prepare for any no-deal Brexit - a target the industry has said will be challenging.
The EU's drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said last August that it and national regulators had set up a task force to minimize supply disruptions arising over the next two years, adding that Brexit would likely affect the availability of medicines in the EU.

The Europe-wide drugs watchdog EMA is moving from London to Amsterdam, prompting many drugmakers to prepare duplicate product testing and licensing arrangements.

The internal review found ""significant errors"" in CCHEN's accounting of the sales of the world's top lithium producers Albemarle Corp and SQM between 1984 and 2015, suggesting the agency at times had lost track of how much lithium was being exported and where it was going. 
Nuclear watchdog CCHEN is the de-facto gatekeeper for Chile's coveted production of the battery material that is used in electric cars, mobile phones and many other consumer goods. The South American country is now the world's number two producer of lithium. 
The findings of the two-year investigation, which expands on a 2016 audit of SQM's 2010-2015 sales, were presented to CCHEN's executive committee in October and have yet to be reported. 
The agency is in the process of adopting new, more stringent oversight of the industry, including new protocols and closer enforcement of exports, the documents show. But for more than 30 years, the report said inconsistencies and omissions riddled the spreadsheets that detail the sales of both Albemarle and SQM, the world's top two producers of lithium, according to minutes from the presentation. 
The initial findings prompted CCHEN executive committee members to call for a new investigation to determine just how much lithium had gone unaccounted for, the minutes show. 
The investigation would look into the possibility that the errors and omissions were deliberate and part of some fraudulent scheme. It was not immediately clear, however, who the investigation might target and whether indeed it would be launched.
LACK OF CLARITY
CCHEN in September denied a request to triple production from Albemarle, the world's top producer of lithium, citing, in part, uncertainty over how much lithium the company had already mined.
Albemarle declined to comment on the matter.
A spokesperson for SQM said the company had yet to review the results of the study and preferred not to comment, adding that SQM's internal controls had detected no ""irregularities"" in export records.
But CCHEN’s discovery that its records of lithium exports are far from accurate could complicate the agency’s efforts to determine just how much lithium SQM and Albemarle have mined and when their quotas of the metal will be exhausted.
CCHEN did not reply to requests to comment on the status of the proposed probe into fraud, or how it could impact Albemarle or SQM. 
When CCHEN executive committee members asked why the regulator had failed to properly document movements of lithium between 2011 and 2015, Mauricio Maureira, who oversees lithium exports for the agency, cited a ""lack of diligence in the office of control,"" according to minutes of the CCHEN executive meeting in October reviewed by Reuters. ""Unfortunately, there's no other explanation,"" he said. 
Chile’s lithium industry has recently come under increasing scrutiny by various government agencies, including the country’s environmental and water authorities, who have taken steps to increase oversight of lithium production amid booming demand. Albemarle and SQM's Chilean operations are critical to the global supply of lithium. 
Together, their Chile plants produced nearly 40 percent of the world's lithium in 2017.Nuclear agency CCHEN has authorized lithium quotas and exports since 1979, when the military government of ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet declared lithium ""strategic"" because of its nuclear applications. 
For years, lithium was a little-known metal supplying a niche industry. Its use in sensitive nuclear applications is now limited. But the advent of cell phones and electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries has sent demand for the newly anointed ""white gold"" sky-rocketing.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 10:50AM ET</span>","As economy sours, Erdogan's party could lose grip on big cities in local polls","By Orhan Coskun and Ece Toksabay
ANKARA (Reuters) - After a decade and a half in power and an economic boom gone sour, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party could lose control of some large cities in local elections on March 31.
While Erdogan will continue to hold sweeping executive powers, a weak showing by the AKP would be a symbolic blow and illustrate how frustration over the economy has hurt a politician long seen as unbeatable. 
Two party sources told Reuters that two of its internal polls showed support for the AKP had fallen to 32-35 percent, before accounting for the 30 percent of voters still undecided. In 2014 local elections the AKP took 43 percent, far ahead of its nearest rival, the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), which polled less than 25 percent.
The AKP now faces the potential loss of Ankara, the capital, and a tight race in Istanbul, the sources said. The AKP party, or its predecessor, has controlled both cities, as well as most other big Turkish municipalities, for more than 20 years. 
Erdogan rose to prominence as mayor of Istanbul and is known to attach special importance to municipal elections, seeing local politics as key to how voters view the national government. While he is not up for election, the polls are widely regarded as a referendum on his rule. 
A sharp fall in AKP support would be all the more discomforting given that its alliance partner, the nationalist MHP, is not fielding candidates in some municipalities.
""For Erdogan, it's about prestige, too. He had to form alliances with other parties in the last two elections, which he didn't need to in the past,"" said Gareth Jenkins, a veteran Turkey analyst. 
""If he loses Ankara or Istanbul this time despite the alliance, it will mean that his political career is in decline. It may be a long and slow decline, but at the end of the day, it's a decline.""
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
The Islamist-rooted AKP swept to power in 2002 on a platform of ending graft, boosting the economy and aiding millions of poor, pious Turks largely ignored by the secular elite.
It has overseen a period of thunderous economic growth, fueled largely by debt and construction, that economists warned was unsustainable. The economy was shaken last year by a currency crisis that sent inflation to 25 percent and sapped growth.
The AKP is now pushing stimulus measures aimed at poorer voters - hiking the minimum wage, cutting some import taxes, restructuring credit card debt - but the impact appears limited and the economy is headed for recession. 
""Support for our party is around 32-35 percent, clearly below our expectations. But we are still at the beginning of the election campaign, and we will work toward persuading those who have not decided yet,"" a senior AKP official told Reuters.
""The situation in Ankara is not great. We may face similar challenges in other big cities,"" the official said, adding he believed it was doing relatively well in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city and its commercial capital.
A second AKP official confirmed that the two surveys put support for the party at below 35 percent, down from the 52.59 percent Erdogan received in last June's presidential election.
The opposition CHP declined to discuss its internal poll figures when asked by Reuters. A senior member said their aim was to take some big cities, including Istanbul and Ankara. Turkey's third biggest city, Izmir, is a CHP stronghold. 
Former prime minister Binali Yildirim is running for mayor of Istanbul but faces a stiff challenge from the CHP, even though its candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, is relatively unknown.
The victor in Istanbul will likely win by a narrow margin, said Murat Sari of polling company Konsensus, which puts Yildirim at 53 percent and Imamoglu at 46 percent. 
""The CHP is leading in Ankara by one percentage point. There are many people who haven't decided yet, but the AKP may lose Ankara,"" Sari said. 

Jenkins, the analyst, said it was clear that Erdogan's message was not resonating as strongly as it once did: ""He has successfully sold hope to the society that they will become richer. At the moment, we don't expect any return to higher growth soon, so he's no longer able to sell this hope.""

Israel's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem estimates that 565,000 Hungarian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, the majority of them deported to the Auschwitz death camp between May and July 1944.
In October of that year, when the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross party took power in Hungary, thousands of Jews from Budapest were murdered on the banks of the Danube, according to Yad Vashem.
Israeli Interior Minister Arye Deri said on Monday Hungarian counterpart Sandor Pinter had agreed to his request to provide special equipment to forensic experts from the Israeli volunteer group ZAKA who traveled with him to Budapest.
The Hungarian Interior Ministry has yet to respond to emailed questions seeking comment.
On Tuesday ZAKA divers began scanning the bottom of the Danube with an underwater sonar near a Budapest bridge where some remains were recovered several years ago.
""I think it is a triumph, it is after all these years we come to this work, this holy work on Hungarian ground,"" Ilan Berkovich, leader of the ZAKA team, told Reuters.
""For me, I am basically Hungarian, my parents, my grandparents, all my family actually were from here. It is kind of a closure, so emotionally it is amazing, actually.""
ZAKA director Yehuda Meshi-Zahav told Reuters it remained unclear where any remains recovered would be buried. ""That has yet to be determined. There is some sensitivity in Hungary about this matter,"" he said. 
Hungarian Jews have voiced concern at the right-wing nationalism of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has praised a Hungarian wartime leader who was an ally of Hitler and used an image of Jewish U.S. financier George Soros in an anti-immigration billboard campaign.
On a visit to Jerusalem last July, Orban said Jews should feel safe under his government. Right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who praised Orban, has found common cause with him on Soros and the U.S. billionaire's support for critics of their governments' policies. 
More divers are expected in Budapest at the end of February to recover as much as possible of the Holocaust victims' remains in a mission estimated to cost more than one million euros.
""For us it is very important to give respect for the people who died, even after 70 or something years, and we do the best we can to find as many as we can,"" ZAKA diver Ilan Levy said.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>",Explainer: Protesters in Sudan want end to Bashir's 30-year rule,"By Khalid Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Weeks of protests pose one of the most serious challenges to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's 30-year rule just as his party prepares to change the constitution to allow him to seek another term.
The protests began on Dec. 19 over soaring bread prices, one result of a deep economic crisis that started when the southern part of the country seceded after a referendum in 2011, taking oil wealth with it.
The authorities' heavy-handed crackdown on the demonstrations has fueled the anger. At least 24 people have been killed, officials say, and hundreds more have been injured. Activists say the death toll is at least 40.
Although the protests are small they show no sign of ending, and many are seeking a change of regime.
Bashir is defiant. The 75-year-old blamed the protests on foreign ""agents"" and challenged his opponents to seek power through the ballot box.
WHY DID THE PROTESTS START?
The protests began in Atbara, a city in northeastern Sudan known as a stronghold for anti-government activity. Several thousand people took to the streets after the government tried to end a bread shortage.
As a result of the measures, the price of some bread tripled and although there had been bread queues for months, people were angry about the price rise. 
The authorities quickly changed the policy and scrambled to crush the protests, declaring a state of emergency in Atbara and imposing a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
But they had already spread to the Red Sea city of Port Sudan and to al-Qadarif in the south east, before reaching the capital Khartoum.
""It is not protests anymore. It's almost a full-fledged revolution,"" said Mohammad Osman, a Sudanese political analyst.
He said the scale of these protests is unprecedented. ""Multiple constituencies are joining forces against Bashir's regime in order to achieve radical change,"" he said.
Protesters were also angered by cash shortages due to restrictions on withdrawals aimed at keeping money in the banks, which themselves are struggling to find cash.
But what started as a protest about living conditions has turned into one about the regime. 
Echoing the 2011 uprisings that swept other Arab countries including Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Bahrain, their common cry is: ""The people want the regime to fall."" 
Once seen as the breadbasket of the Arab world, the protesters say that many years of mismanagement have turned Sudan into a failed state.
They blame Bashir for South Sudan's secession and for Sudan being placed on a U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism. 
HOW SERIOUS ARE THEY?
The numbers in Atbara have dwindled from the initial thousands but hundreds now take part in near daily protests in other cities around Sudan, despite the crackdown. They are the most sustained under Bashir's rule. 
In September 2013, dozens of people were killed in a few days of protests sparked by a cut in fuel subsidies. Authorities put the death toll at 84 while rights groups said up to 200 people died.
In January last year, Sudan saw protests sparked by bread subsidy cuts, but they were short-lived.
""With the protests continuing for a fourth week...the situation is open to all possibilities,"" said Abd al-Latif al-Bony, a political science professor at Khartoum's National University.
""Each side is trying to totally cast out the other side, which is dangerous for the stability of the country.""
HOW VULNERABLE IS BASHIR?
Bashir has long been the uncontested leader in Sudan.
The opposition comprises several political parties whose leaders are in Sudan, and several armed groups led mainly from abroad or from conflict zones in southern or western Sudan. 
Members of opposition parties have joined the protests which are mainly led by a little-known group of trade unionists called the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA). With a weekly program of demonstrations circulated on social media, the SPA has eclipsed the traditional opposition parties. 
Bashir is the head of the Islamic Movement party, which has a similar ideology to the global Islamist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. 
He also has direct control over security forces, including the feared Rapid Support Force comprising former militias loyal to the ruling party, which he has often used to crush dissent.
But his position has been eroded by the economic crisis that sent inflation soaring to around 70 percent.
Bashir's supporters fear the protests may embolden small but influential factions within the ruling party who oppose changing the constitution to allow the president to seek a new term in office in 2020.
WHO COULD TAKE OVER IF BASHIR FALLS?
Since independence in 1956, autocrats blamed for some of Sudan's worst woes have come to power through military coups. The military also stepped in at least twice, in 1964 and 1985, to back popular uprisings for change. 
But over the past 30 years, Bashir has sought to fill key army posts and those in various security apparatus with members of his Islamic Movement.
Still, Sudanese opposition parties look to the army as an acceptable body to lead any transitional period until new elections were organized.
While military officers who had brought positive change to Sudan in the past were not public figures, Bashir's deputy, Bakri Hassan Saleh, a former army general could step in to fill any vacuum left by the president. 
Local experts say that the intelligence chief, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, also known as Salah Gosh, an Islamist with huge influence in Sudan, was another likely candidate but he does not have a military background and that could limit his chances.
Experts say the worst scenario would be a mutiny or a split in the armed forces if the army is asked to crush the protests. 
They say that Bashir, facing the prospect of a trial at the International Criminal Court in the Hague as a war criminal for alleged crimes against humanity in Darfur, will likely resist any attempt to force him to step down, which would put Sudan at risk of a new civil war. 
WHY DOES SUDAN MATTER INTERNATIONALLY?
Sudan was long isolated by U.S. economic and trade sanctions first imposed in 1997, shortly after the country harbored Osama bin Laden. The sanctions were lifted in October 2017.
Bashir has sought better relations with the United States by offering security cooperation but has also courted Russia.
He has sent troops to shore up a Saudi-led Arab alliance trying to curb Iranian influence in Yemen. However, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been slow to deliver aid to Sudan, suspicious of his ties to their Gulf rival Qatar, and to Turkey, which has a foothold on Sudan's Red Sea island of Suakin. 
Sudan is also a key player in the Horn of Africa, an area where international powers are competing for influence.

A sprawling country of some 40 million people, it is also a key transit route for African migrants seeking to reach the Mediterranean on their way to Europe.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",East Libyan forces heading south to secure oil sites,"By Ayman al-Warfalli
BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar have launched a military operation in southern Libya to secure oil and gas facilities and fight extremists, a spokesman said on Tuesday, a move that may alarm the authorities in Tripoli in the west.
Haftar, whose powerbase is the eastern city of Benghazi, leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls the east of the North African nation and major oil ports in the region.
""We announce the start of an operation to liberate the south,"" LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters in Benghazi.
He said the operation's goals included protecting local and foreign oil firms, fighting Islamic State and other extremists, and tackling illegal migration.
He gave few other details about the initiative, but any advance on oilfields in the south by Haftar's forces could be opposed by Libya's internationally recognized administration in Tripoli, which lies in the west of the OPEC nation.
Other military sources told Reuters several LNA units had moved in recent days from Benghazi to Sabha, the biggest city in the south of Libya that lies in the same southwestern region as El Sharara, Libya's biggest oilfield.
El Sharara, more than 200 km (125 miles) from Sabha, has been closed since December due to a protest by tribesmen and state guards demanding salary payments and development in the area.
It was not immediately clear whether the LNA forces were headed to El Sharara. El Feel oilfield, a smaller production facility in the area, has not been affected by protests.
Haftar has become a major player in Libya since his forces seized Benghazi in 2017, after a three-year battle mainly with Islamist fighters.
Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the state-owned National Oil Company, has said he would not reopen the 315,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) El Sharara field without a new security arrangement, although he has not specified what that should be.
Tripoli-based NOC has struggled to keep national oil production steady because armed groups or tribesmen have often forced the closure of El Sharara and other oilfields.
Libyan output has been hovering around 1 million bpd, well below the 1.6 million bpd produced before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and plunged the nation into chaos.
Security in southern Libya is very poor given its remoteness from the main population centers on the northern coast and the overall breakdown of law and order since 2011. The region has frequently experienced clashes between tribes and armed groups.

""He will be able to govern,"" his doctor Antonio Macedo, said in an interview. ""But the recommendation is that he does not leave his home because his immune system will be weak.""
""He must rest at home, but because he is strong and very upbeat, he should recover quickly,"" he said. 
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, was elected in a polarizing election on a platform to rid the country of graft, be tough on crime and liberalize the economy. 
He nearly died last September after being stabbed during a campaign event, which forced him to undergo two surgeries and kept him away from the campaign trail for weeks. He has been using a colostomy bag since. 

Bolsonaro will check into a Sao Paulo hospital on Jan. 27 and undergo the surgery the next day.

THE HAGUE/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court acquitted former Ivorian leader Laurent Gbagbo of war crimes on Tuesday and ordered his immediate release to the joy of dancing supporters and frustration of victims of atrocities.
His freedom and possible return home may shake up the 2020 presidential poll in francophone west Africa's largest economy and the world's biggest cocoa producer. 
President Alassane Ouattara's camp has said he may reconsider a decision not to run if long-time rivals Gbagbo and former president Henri Konan Bedie were to stand.
In the latest high-profile defeat for ICC prosecutors at the Hague, presiding Judge Cuno Tarfusser said they failed to prove accusations against Gbagbo and co-defendant Charles Blé Goudé, a former political youth leader.
Gbagbo, 73, and Goudé, 46, hugged when the decision was announced. In custody for seven years after French troops flushed him out of a presidential bunker, Gbagbo could be freed as soon as Wednesday.
""It is too soon right now to comment on the future and where he will go, but you can imagine he is very attached to Ivory Coast,"" said defense lawyer Emmanuel Altit. 
Rights groups said the verdict denied justice to victims of Ivory Coast's December 2010-April 2011 post-election conflict, when Gbagbo refused to accept defeat by rival Alassane Ouattara and about 3,000 people died in violence.
""How can you free someone who has killed our children and our husbands?"" 33-year-old shopkeeper Salimata Cisse said, surrounded by a crowd of women in the Ivorian commercial capital Abidjan who were all unhappy at the verdict.
Outside the courthouse, dozens of Gbagbo supporters, many who traveled to The Hague by bus from Paris, broke into cheers and dancing at the verdict.
""Ooh-la-la!,"" said Gbagbo supporter Olivier Kipre in Abidjan, where people gathered in Gbagbo shirts to watch the proceedings on big screens. ""I'm so joyful. I will become crazy today because I didn't believe he would be released."" 
Some threw themselves to the ground or burst into tears, while taxis passing through a pro-Gbagbo enclave tooted horns.
Gbagbo was the first former head of state tried at the ICC. 
""Forces loyal to both Gbagbo and Ouattara were responsible for shocking violence,"" said Jim Wormington, of Human Rights Watch.
ICC UNDER SCRUTINY
It was another defeat for prosecutors, who also lost cases against Jean-Pierre Bemba, the Congolese ex-vice president released last year after his war crimes conviction was overturned, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who had charges dropped in 2015.
Prosecutors have only won three war crimes convictions over the past 15 years. This time, they failed to show Gbagbo's speeches directly incited crime, judge Tarfusser said.
Gambian prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has held the top job since 2012 but is due to be replaced next year.
""The acquittal underscores how important it is that the process to select the next prosecutor yields a person of integrity and sound judgment who is highly skilled at criminal investigation,"" said James A. Goldston, of the Open Society Justice Initiative rights group.
Gbagbo had faced four counts including murder, rape, persecution and other inhumane acts. 
He rose to prominence as a Marxist firebrand lecturer who challenged the autocratic rule of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Ivory Coast’s first post-independence president. That got him imprisoned for two years in 1971.
He took asylum in France during the 1980s but came back and led protests that forced the old ruler to allow multi-party democracy in 1990 with an election that Gbagbo lost.

Ten years later, Gbagbo supporters helped oust military coup leader General Robert Guei and he took the presidency.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Anti-corruption group Transparency International said on Tuesday it found ""irregularities"" in 47 of 50 constituencies it surveyed during last month's general election in Bangladesh, which was marred by allegations of vote rigging.
The poll that gave Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina a third straight term was undermined by ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and the occupation of polling booths among other malpractices, the group's Bangladesh chapter said.
The government rejected the report, saying the group had ""lost its neutrality"" and should be investigated for any ""secret link"" to the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
In its report, Transparency International said the BNP-led opposition could not effectively campaign for votes, opposition workers were threatened by government agencies, and the Election Commission could not ensure a level-playing field for all parties.
The ruling Awami League-led coalition won 46 of the 50 constituency races surveyed by the organization.
There are 300 elected seats in parliament, and another 50 members are nominated.
""The Election Commission did not perform its role properly,"" Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International's Bangladesh chapter, told reporters in Dhaka.
""We recommend an investigation by a judicial enquiry committee, because such an election is not positive for democracy,"" he added.
An Election Commission spokesman said it would examine the group's report.
H.T. Imam, a political adviser to Hasina and co-chairman of Awami League's election conducting committee, said the anti-corruption group was ""a puppet of the BNP"".
""Now it's time to investigate the (group) to bring to light whether it has any secret link with the BNP,"" Imam told Reuters. 
At least 19 people, including workers of the Awami League, were killed in political violence on election day, according to police.
Opposition leaders have so far boycotted parliament after rejecting the vote result.
All eight opposition MPs, including six from the BNP whose chairwoman is in jail on what the party calls trumped-up corruption charges, have yet to be sworn in.

The United Nations this month called for an independent and impartial investigation into the Dec. 30 election, while Western governments, including the United States and the European Union, have condemned the election-day violence and called for a probe into a range of irregularities.

The minister, 66, is expected to present this government's last budget on Feb. 1 before Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a second term in a general election due by May.
A person familiar with Jaitley's medical condition said the minister had ""recovered well"" from the transplant in New Delhi eight months ago.
A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment.
Jaitley is the publicity head of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's election team and often acts as the chief spokesman for the government.
He continued to push what he sees as India's success story under Modi on Tuesday. In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, he said India's macro-economic parameters such as economic growth, inflation and fiscal deficit had improved substantially during Modi's term.
India's fiscal deficit came down to 3.5 percent of GDP in the 2017/18 fiscal year ended in March from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2013/14, when Modi took charge, he said, adding that India was not satisfied with a 7 to 7.5 percent economic growth rate.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community (SADC) has called an emergency meeting on Thursday in Addis Ababa to discuss Democratic Republic of Congo's disputed presidential election, an adviser to President Joseph Kabila said.
Runner-up Martin Fayulu, who led pre-election polls, filed a fraud complaint on Saturday, asking for a recount after results gave victory to another opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi.
Hearings into Fayulu's complaint opened on Tuesday at the Constitutional Court which has until Friday to render a judgment. 
The Dec. 30 election was meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power, but allegations of fraud cast doubt on the outcome and threatened to reawaken large-scale unrest in the vast Central African country.
Kabila's diplomatic adviser, Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, told Reuters he would attend Thursday's SADC meeting. It was not immediately clear who else from Congo would be present or what action, if any, the bloc might decide to take.
SADC, which includes Congo allies such as South Africa and Angola, on Sunday called for a recount. South Africa and Zambia backtracked on Monday, although Zambia reiterated its call for a government of national unity. 
Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) also plans to file a challenge on Tuesday to the results of the legislative election, which took place the same day as the presidential vote, UDPS spokesman Vidiye Tshimanga said.
Although the presidential candidate of Kabila's ruling coalition, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, won only 24 percent of the vote, the coalition took more than 350 of 500 seats in the National Assembly, compared with about 30 for the UDPS. 
That could undermine Tshisekedi's ability to live up to campaign promises to break with Kabila's long tenure, which began in 2001 when his father was assassinated. 
""There are a certain number of inconsistencies between the numbers we have and those presented by the (electoral commission),"" Tshimanga told reporters late on Monday. ""A team of lawyers ... has prepared a case that will be filed to the competent authorities."" 
Fayulu alleges that Tshisekedi's win was the result of a backroom deal between Tshisekedi and Kabila that will let Kabila maintain control over important ministries and the security services. 
Tshisekedi and Kabila deny there was any deal.
Congo's influential Catholic Church has also said the presidential results were inconsistent with those gathered by its 40,000 election observers. 

It has not said who it believes won, but three diplomats briefed on its findings said they indicated it was Fayulu.

Kanaka Durga, 39, a civil servant, suffered injuries to her head and had to be hospitalized, police said. She claims she was attacked only minutes after she returned to her home from spending a month at undisclosed locations fearing attacks by conservative Hindu groups, police said.
""We received a complaint from Kanaka Durga alleging that she was attacked by family members of her husband when she returned home after entering the temple,"" said Jaya Mani, officer in charge of Perinthalmanna police station in Malappuram district, which is in the state of Kerala where the Sabarimala temple is located.
Police were investigating, Mani said. 
A second police source said Durga had alleged she was assaulted by the mother-in-law. The mother-in-law had denied the allegation, he said.
Durga did not return calls seeking comment. The family members, including Durga's mother-in-law, could not be reached for comment.
The Sabarimala temple has been the site of tension since India's Supreme Court ruled in late September to end a ban on women and girls aged from 10-50 from entering.
The temple refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit were blocked by thousands of devotees. 
That was until Bindu Ammini, 40, a law lecturer at Kerala's Kannur University, and Durga finally succeeded in entering the temple on Jan. 2 through a side entrance in the middle of the night. Some other women have claimed they have got into the temple since then. 
Their entry sparked widespread protests and a day-long strike in Kerala led in part by members of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
""The attack is a natural reaction of the family members, who are strong believers of the temple's customs and rituals,"" Ammini said. 

""Her friends told me that her family members were angry with her action. They have unleashed their anger when they saw her.""

Trump, who announced he was pulling U.S. troops out of northeast Syria last month, suggested in a tweet on Sunday creating safe zone, without elaborating.
""The safe zone issue, including a safe zone along Turkey's borders that will be formed by us - an issue that I have brought up since the Obama era - was reiterated by him as 20 miles,"" Erdogan told members of his AK Party in parliament.
He later told reporters that the zone could be extended beyond 20 miles, but did not say by how far.
Turkey has promised to take over the fight against Islamic State in Syria following the U.S. withdrawal. However, bitter differences between Washington and Ankara over the Kurdish YPG militia had soured talks between the two NATO partners.
The YPG has been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State, but Turkey views it as a terrorist organization and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.
Monday's call between the two leaders came after Trump threatened Turkey with economic devastation if Turkish forces attacked the YPG militia.
Erdogan said he was saddened by Trump's tweet but that the phone call later in the day was positive.
Trump's threat to devastate Turkey's economy also sparked concern among investors, sending the lira down as much as 1.6 percent on Monday. Erdogan said he and Trump had agreed to improve economic ties during their phone call.

""Turkey will continue to do what it has to in order to solve this issue in line with the spirit of its alliance, so long as our rights and laws are respected,"" he said. ""We reached a historic understanding with Trump last night.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's long-delayed general election to end military rule will have to be postponed from its Feb. 24 date and will likely be held in March, two officials in the Election Commission said on Tuesday.
The Election Commission of Thailand has not announced the postponement, but two senior election officials told Reuters it was impossible to hold the polls on Feb. 24, as announced last month.
The military junta that has ruled for nearly five years had earlier suggested a one-month delay because of scheduling clashes with the coronation of the king in May.
""The February 24 election cannot take place because the Election Commission doesn't have enough time to organize it,"" a senior commission official said.
""There are now two possible dates ... March 10 or March 24,"" the official said.
Coronation ceremonies for King Maha Vajiralongkorn have been scheduled for May 4-6, and the government said that there would be royal rituals taking place 15 days prior to and after those three dates.
""There will be an election before coronation,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters on Tuesday.
""We have to organize both things together, but we must give time to the coronation preparation first,"" Prayuth said.
The two largest political parties said they had no objection to the delay.
Under the law, the Election Commission has to endorse winning members of parliament within 60 days of a vote, and parliament must convene within 15 days of the election results and the King will have to preside over the opening of parliament.
The government says these political events could clash with ceremonies for the coronation.
The monarchy is revered in Thailand, and this year's coronation will be the first in living memory for most of the population.
King Vajiralongkorn, 66, has been serving since shortly after his father died in 2016 following a 70-year reign, but he has not been officially crowned during a lengthy mourning period.
The military government has repeatedly delayed holding a new election since it overthrew an elected prime minister in a 2014 coup.
Last month, the junta lifted a ban on political activities imposed since the coup, which allows political parties to start campaigning.
Dozens of activists protested against a possible delay of the election on Jan. 6 in Bangkok, the first such gathering since the government lifted the ban on political activity.

Since then, there have been several similar gatherings in other parts of the country.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Hindu ascetics lead millions of Indians in holy bath,"By Alasdair Pal
PRAYAGRAJ, India (Reuters) - Millions of pilgrims began bathing on the first official day of India's Kumbh Mela on Tuesday, the world's largest religious festival where politics play an important role ahead of a general election this year.
During the eight-week festival at Prayagraj in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, up to 150 million people, including a million foreign visitors, are expected to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna, and a mythical third river, the Saraswati.
Devout Hindus believe bathing in the waters of the Ganges absolves people of sins and at the time of the Kumbh Mela, or the ""festival of the pot"", it brings salvation from the cycle of life and death. 
A highlight is the appearance of the Naga sadhus, or ascetics, who worship Shiva and bathe on the first day of the festival. 
Many sadhus belong to monastic orders called Akharas and some live in remote caves, stepping out only for the Kumbh Mela, generally held once every three years in four cities across India. 
Shortly before dawn on Tuesday, the first naked, ash-smeared ascetics, the Panchayati, plunged into the water amid cries of ""har har Mahadev"", or ""everyone is Mahadev"", another name for Shiva. 
""It is out of this world,"" said Varun K Seth, a saffron-clad sadhu. ""When you get in the water, you feel like you are alive.""
Members of the largest monastic order at the festival, the Juna Akhara, raced down to the water carrying tridents and spears as police held back throngs of spectators.
""The river gives us immortality,"" said a naked sadhu from the Juna Akhara as he reapplied a coating of ash on his body after bathing.
POLITICAL FLAVOR
While the festival is best known for the reclusive sadhus, the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ever-present. 
Giant cardboard cutouts of Modi, the Hindu-nationalist leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party who faces a tough test in a general election due by May, adorned the sacred site.
The BJP lost power in three states in assembly elections in December, and will want to avoid a similar result during the general election in Uttar Pradesh, a state of 220 million people where a strong showing can often decide the outcome.
""Modi is a good man,"" said festival goer Seth, who gestured at a figurine of the prime minister. ""He is watching over us."" 
Modi's chief minister in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu priest pictured on billboards across the city, has championed policies that play to the party's core Hindu base and alarmed Muslims.
This year he transformed a smaller Ardh, or ""half"" Kumbh Mela, into a full version of the festival. He also replaced the Muslim names of several cities with Hindu names - including Prayagraj, which was Allahabad until October. 
""Yogi is a great leader who cares for the people,"" said Kuldeep Banderi, a pilgrim from Delhi. ""If this Kumbh is Ardh think what the next will be like.""
For the first time at the Kumbh Mela, a transgender ashram known as the Kinnar Akhara and led by rights activist Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi from Mumbai, joined the first bathing day.
India legalized gay sex in September, but the LGBT community still faces prejudice in the deeply religious country. 
Members of the Kinnar Akhara received a police escort to the bathing site, where Tripathi plunged into the waters fully clothed to the cheers of her followers. 
The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pot containing the nectar of immortality from demons.

In a 12-day fight for possession, four drops fell to earth, in the cities of Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik, which now share the Kumbhs.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States and North Korea plan to hold high-level talks in Washington this week to discuss a second meeting between their leaders, South Korean media said on Tuesday, as the old enemies seek an ""interim"" deal to revitalizes nuclear talks.
The meeting, led by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol, is due on Thursday or Friday, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified diplomatic source familiar with the issue.
They are expected to finalize the date and venue of a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the newspaper said.
The U.S. embassy in Seoul referred questions to the White House. The White House offered no immediate comment on the Chosun Ilbo report, while a State Department official said: ""We don't have any meetings to announce.""
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted an unidentified diplomatic source as saying Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol could meet this week.
The North Korean delegation could visit the United States ""as soon as this week"" but plans have not been finalised, a CNN reporter, citing an unidentified source, said on Twitter. 
Trump wrote Kim Jong Un a letter, which was flown to Pyongyang and hand delivered over the weekend, the CNN reporter added, citing the source.
South Korea's foreign ministry spokesman told reporters the North and the United States were ""in contact"" but it was ""inappropriate"" to comment on plans for talks.
A meeting this week could mean the two sides are nearing a compromise after months of standoff over how to move forward in ending North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
Trump and Kim pledged at their first summit, in Singapore in June, to work toward denuclearization ""of the Korean peninsula"". But there has been little significant progress.
Pompeo, who made several trips to Pyongyang last year, sought to meet his counterpart last November, but the talks were called off at the last minute. 
Contact was resumed after Kim's New Year's speech, in which he said he was willing to meet Trump ""at any time,"" South Korea's ambassador to the United States, Cho Yoon-je, told reporters last week. 
In Seoul, South Korea deleted a description of North Korea as an ""enemy"" in its defense white paper released on Tuesday, though it said its weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace and stability. 
INTERIM MEASURES
The United States and South Korea have been discussing how to respond to any North Korean steps toward denuclearization, South Korean officials told Reuters. 
The United States is considering easing sanctions in exchange for the North's discarding and sending abroad its intercontinental ballistic missiles, in addition to freezing its nuclear program, the Chosun Ilbo said, citing its source. 
U.S. responses could include exemptions from sanctions for inter-Korean business and opening a liaison office, Seoul officials said. 
""Those ideas are being discussed as interim measures, not as an end state, in order to expedite the denuclearization process, because the North wouldn't respond to any demand for a declaration of facilities and weapons,"" said a senior South Korean official, who declined to be identified.
""The end goal remains unchanged, whether it be complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, or final, fully verified denuclearization."" 
The official said a Trump and Kim meeting could happen by early March, though added: ""No one knows what Trump is thinking.""
Kim reiterated his resolve to meet Trump during a meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump said this month he had received a ""great"" letter from Kim and would probably meet him again soon. 

""At the second summit, they'll probably focus on reaching a possible interim deal, rather than a comprehensive roadmap for denuclearization,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea's Sejong Institute.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 04:27AM ET</span>",Japan's Olympic Committee head denies impropriety in 2020 bid procedures,"By Elaine Lies and Jack Tarrant
TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Japan's Olympic Committee confirmed that he had been questioned by French authorities in December on Tuesday but repeated his denial there was anything improper about Tokyo's bid for the 2020 Games and vowed to prove his innocence.
French financial prosecutors investigating a multi-million dollar payment made by the bid committee to a Singaporean consultancy questioned Tsunekazu Takeda in Paris and he was placed under formal investigation for suspected corruption on Dec. 10, a judicial source told Reuters on Friday.
Takeda told a packed news conference there were no reasons to doubt any part of Japan's dealings with the Singaporean consultancy in connection with Tokyo's bid and that he would cooperate fully with French authorities.
After apologizing to the Japanese people and everyone involved in organizing the 2020 Tokyo Games for worrying them, Takeda repeated denials first made on Friday that there were any improprieties in Japan's dealings with the Singaporean consultancy.
""There were two contracts exchanged between the Tokyo bid committee and the Singaporean company, but they were concluded under the usual sort of procedures and passed around and approved as usual,"" Takeda said. ""I was the final person to approve them, many others had done so before me.""
He added the contracts were for lobbying and information gathering, that the payments were as usual for such work, and noted that a 2016 investigation by a third-party committee had cleared the 2020 bid committee of any wrongdoing.
""From here on in, I will fully cooperate with the French authorities and make every effort to prove my innocence,"" he said.
Under French law, a formal investigation means there is ""serious or consistent evidence"" implicating a suspect in a crime. It is one step closer to a trial, but such investigations can be dropped without going to court.
French investigators have led a years-long probe into corruption in athletics and in early 2016 extended their inquiry into the bidding and voting processes for the hosting of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
SHADOW OVER PREPARATIONS
Whatever the outcome of the French investigation, the news now hangs over preparations for Tokyo 2020 just 18 months out from the start of the summer showpiece.
Tokyo 2020 organizers, however, moved to distance themselves from the bidding team's activities.
""Tokyo won the 2020 race because the city presented the best bid,"" Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told Reuters in an interview later on Tuesday. 
""The mission of the organizing committee is to deliver the Games for athletes and spectators around the world. We want to continue to focus on this mission to make this happen.""
""The organizing committee was established after the election so the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee has no idea to know the details of its (bidding team) activities.
""There will be no impact to Games preparations,"" Takaya stressed.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said during a visit to the Japanese capital in December that he couldn't remember a host city being as well prepared as Tokyo.
Takaya said there had been no ""specific signals or messages"" from the IOC to Tokyo 2020 organizers regarding Takeda.
SENIOR IOC MEMBER
The move against Takeda is linked to an investigation French prosecutors launched in 2016 into more than $2 million of payments by the Japanese bidding committee to consultancy firm Black Tidings, which was terminated in 2014.
Prosecuting judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke now suspects Takeda - a former Olympic showjumper, longstanding Olympics official and second cousin of Emperor Akihito - of paying bribes to secure his nation's winning bid, the judicial source said on Friday.
Takeda, 71, a great-grandchild of Emperor Meiji who competed in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, has been a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee since 1987 and its president since 2001. 
He has helped coordinate preparations for several Winter Olympics as a senior member of the IOC and also heads the IOC's marketing commission.
The IOC ethics commission opened a file on Takeda on Friday.

This investigation is the latest blow to the governing body, which has been trying to clean up the bidding process around Olympic Games following a spate of corruption allegations and increased spending by host cities.

Strike action is also expected in Munich, Leipzig, Dresden and Erfurt, meaning hundreds of flights will be canceled.
The latest walkouts follow strikes at five airports last week and were denounced by ADV as excessive.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 03:23AM ET</span>",Explainer: The insurgents plunging Myanmar's Rakhine back into chaos,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's government says it has ordered the military to ""crush"" rebels in the western state of Rakhine, following raids by insurgents that killed 13 police officers earlier this month.
The United Nations says fighting between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army, which recruits from among the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group, has forced about 5,000 people from their homes in the state in the past month.
The latest violence underscores the complexity of the ethnic divisions that have long scarred Rakhine. In 2017 attacks on security posts in the north of the state by insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority provoked a military crackdown that sent more than 730,000 fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies, and sparked the biggest crisis of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's young administration.
Aid workers say military aircraft and trucks have been seen arriving in Rakhine since early January - raising fears conflict could intensify once again in the state.
The group's rise threatens to further undermine Suu Kyi's hopes of securing peace across Myanmar, but who are the fighters of the Arakan Army, and what do they want?
JADE MINES TO SNIPER RIFLES 
The Arakan Army says it formed nearly a decade ago to fight for self-determination for Rakhine, which it says has been exploited by a remote central government.
Many early recruits were ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who had traveled to northern Myanmar to make their fortune toiling in the jade mines there.
They gathered and trained in territory along Myanmar's border with China that is held by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), one of the largest ethnic armed groups still fighting the Myanmar military. Arakan Army fighters have fought the military alongside the KIA as part of a ""northern alliance"" in northern Shan state since late 2016.
Arakan Army forces have also moved into the rugged western borderlands with India and Bangladesh, where they are believed to number about 3,000.
In parallel, the group has launched a propaganda push aimed at inspiring an uprising across Rakhine in 2020.
Slick online videos show young men and women insurgents marching, wrestling and firing modern assault weapons and sniper rifles. They often feature the group's charismatic chief, Twan Mrat Naing, who wears thick-rimmed glasses and a military beret. 
ETHNIC GRIEVANCES
The Arakan Army in its propaganda largely steers clear of the communal conflict between Buddhists and Muslims that has riven Rakhine in recent years. 
Instead the group has found fertile ground appealing to a sense of economic and historical injustice directed at the Myanmar state and its Bamar ethnic majority.
Though rich in oil and other natural resources and a focus of China's Belt and Road Initiative investment drive, Rakhine remains one of Myanmar's poorest states. Only 17 percent of households in the state have access to safe drinking water year-round, far below the proportion elsewhere in Myanmar, according to a 2017 World Bank survey. Nearly 300,000 households there do not have a toilet, it found.
The coastal area now known as Rakhine was historically an independent kingdom, Arakan, until a Burmese invasion in the 18th century. A demonstration in January last year to mark the anniversary of the Arakan kingdom's overthrow ended in bloodshed when police opened fire on protesters. 
The figurehead of the state's most popular political party, the Arakan National Party (ANP) was arrested soon after with another activist and charged with high treason. They remain on trial. Many ethnic Rakhines resent that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy installed its own chief minister in the state after taking power in 2016, despite the ANP winning most seats in the state at elections in 2015.
INSURGENT INFILTRATION
After only sporadic encounters with the military in recent years, the Arakan Army has reported at least two dozen clashes with security forces in the last few months. It says it is responding to military aggression in Rakhine that has also targeted civilians.
""Rakhine state must have its own army,"" Arakan Army chief Twan Mrat Naing told local news site the Irrawaddy this week. ""Having an armed group means the survival of the Rakhine ethnicity.""
The government describes the group as a terrorist organization and says it could destabilize the state for years to come.
Analysts say the Arakan Army, which has trained with Kachin rebels, poses a potentially greater military threat than the ill-equipped Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army that precipitated the 2017 crisis.
Arakan Army (AA) fighters appear to be ""well-trained and generally extremely well-equipped"", said Anthony Davis, a security analyst with Jane's at IHS-Markit, describing the recent violence as a ""watershed"" for the conflict. 
""What we've seen is the AA shifting from a preparatory phase of political and military infiltration into northern Rakhine state that began in 2015,"" said Davis.

""They've now taken it to a much higher level, operating at platoon and even company strength across almost all the townships in the north of the state, and that's new.""

Britain's lower house of parliament will vote on Tuesday on the deal on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union that Minister Theresa May struck with Brussels.
It appears highly likely that lawmakers will reject it, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly departure to a complete reversal of Brexit.
A no-deal Brexit could leave the status of Britons living in the EU and of EU citizens living in Britain unclear. Austria's foreign minister said on Monday the rights of Britons in Austria would be protected and Europe minister Gernot Bluemel said on Tuesday cabinet would take steps in that direction.
""Tomorrow in cabinet we will agree on a cabinet decision and send a bill for legal assessment in which we want to do just that -- clarify the question of what happens next with British citizens,"" Bluemel told state broadcaster ORF.
""To the extent that they have lived and worked in Austria up until the withdrawal date, they should be able to continue to do that,"" he said, adding that Austria was reciprocating what Britain has said it will do for EU citizens living there.
He stopped short, however, of saying that Austria would loosen its ban on dual citizenship to allow British citizens there to become Austrian while retaining their British passports.
Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl said last week that Austria would allow its roughly 25,000 citizens living in Britain to acquire British nationality, making a new exception to the ban. Austria is one of just a handful of EU countries that generally do not allow dual citizenship.
Austria would also ensure that companies registered under British law and headquartered in Austria could continue to be based there, Bluemel said, without specifying how many companies that would affect.

(Reuters) - The pedestal for a Confederate monument called Silent Sam that has been a flashpoint for demonstrations at a North Carolina university will be removed, the school's president said on Monday, nearly five months after protesters toppled the statue.
The plan to remove the statue's base and commemorative plaques was outlined by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill chancellor Carol Folt, in a statement that also said she would resign after this academic year's graduation ceremonies.
""The base and tablets will be preserved until their future is decided,"" Folt said in a statement. 
The effort to eliminate Confederate monuments gained momentum in the United States after avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof in 2015 murdered nine black people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The rampage ultimately led to the removal of a Confederate flag from the statehouse in Columbia.
Silent Sam was erected in 1913 to honor soldiers of the pro-slavery Confederacy killed during the U.S. Civil War. Protesters used ropes to pull down the statue on Aug. 20.
Opponents of Confederate monuments say they glorify the South's legacy of slavery and racism. Supporters view the memorials as emblems of American history.
Some University of North Carolina students celebrated the plan to take away the pedestal and plaques on Monday, according to Raleigh television station WTVD.
Folt announced her resignation on the same day University of North Carolina's board of governors was meeting in closed session to discuss leadership issues at her Chapel Hill campus, board chairman Harry Smith said in a statement.
The board was not advised of Folt's plan to remove the pedestal and plaques and was disappointed by her action, Smith said, and he added, ""It lacks transparency and it undermines and insults the board's goal to operate with class and dignity.""
Folt, in her statement, acknowledged the decision to remove the objects could upset some people, but said her goal was to preserve public safety and ""begin the healing process.""
In December, officials at Chapel Hill, which is the flagship campus for the University of North Carolina system, recommended that Silent Sam be relocated to a more than $5 million facility to house historical artifacts.

But the University of North Carolina board of governors rejected the plan.

Police operations targeting the followers of Fethullah Gulen have been carried out regularly since the failed coup and have recently gained momentum. Authorities in Istanbul and Adana ordered the arrest of more than 100 military suspects last week.
The Ankara chief prosecutor's office said it ordered the arrest of 50 military suspects - 3 lieutenants and 47 sergeants - as well as 55 people accused of using the ByLock messaging app, the newspaper reported.
Turkey outlawed ByLock in the aftermath of the failed putsch, saying followers of Gulen used it to communicate on the night of July 15, 2016, when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to overthrow the government, killing some 250 people. 
Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.
The prosecutor's office in the central province of Konya ordered the detention of 50 people, including military personnel and their contacts in the Gulen network, the newspaper said.
The prosecutor's offices of two other provinces, Mugla and Kocaeli, ordered the detention of 15 and 22 military personnel respectively. 
More than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial, while 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs as part of the post-coup purges.

Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concerns over the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government has said the security measures were necessary due to the gravity of the threat Turkey faces.

Washington warned Tehran this month against undertaking three planned rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology.
The United States is concerned that the long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit can also be used to launch warheads.
Iran, which considers its space program a matter of national pride, has said its space vehicle launches and missile tests were not violations and would continue.
Under the U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrined Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers - which Washington pulled out of last spring - the country is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.
Azari-Jahromi said that the satellite, named Payam, failed in the third stage of the launch because it ""did not reach adequate speed"", according to a report on the ministry's website.
The satellite was intended to be used for imaging and communications purposes and was mounted with four cameras, according to the report. 
The satellite was planned to stay at an altitude of 500 km for approximately three years. 
Another satellite named Doosti is waiting to be launched, Azari-Jahromi wrote in a Twitter post.
""We should not come up short or stop,"" Azari-Jahromi wrote on Twitter after announcing the failed launch. ""It's exactly in these circumstances that we Iranians are different than other people in spirit and bravery.""
Iran launched its first domestically built satellite, the OMID (Hope) research and telecoms satellite in 2009 on the 30th anniversary of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution in 2009.
The 40th anniversary falls in February.

Tsipras called the confidence vote following the resignation of right-wing Defense Minister Panos Kammenos over an accord to end a long dispute between Greece and Macedonia by changing the Balkan state's name.
Parliament will begin a debate on Tuesday and the vote is expected on Wednesday night.
The prime minister said last week he could call a snap election if he failed to win 151 votes. His left-wing Syriza party has 145 seats in the 300-seat chamber and the support of one independent lawmaker. 
Another four lawmakers have said that they will back him. A fifth, Spyros Danellis, announced his decision to do likewise to his Potami party on Tuesday night, a party official said. 
""Danellis called (Potami leader) Stavros Theodorakis late last night and told him that he will support the government,"" the official told Reuters.

More than 90 people were also wounded in the attack near the Green Village compound, which houses several international companies and charities, in eastern Kabul.
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Islamist militant group, said Taliban fighters were responsible for the attack in which he claimed dozens of foreign and Afghan security forces were killed and wounded.
""Five attackers, including the suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden vehicle, were involved in the attack,"" Mujahid said in a statement.
The Taliban often inflate casualty figures in attacks against Afghan government or foreign targets. 
The latest attack came as Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special peace envoy for Afghanistan, tours the region for meetings aimed at bringing an end to a war that has dragged on for more than 17 years.
Fighting has not subsided even as the talks intensify, with the Taliban and other insurgent groups carrying out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting security forces and government officials. Civilians, however, almost invariably bear the brunt of most attacks.

The British parliament is widely expected to vote against May's deal on Tuesday, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly divorce to reversing Brexit.
Allies claim that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered May last-minute help after saying the European Union could grant extra concessions if MPs reject her deal, the report said. 
The concessions include persuading Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to agree to an end date to the so-called Irish backstop, the report added.
The EU has told May that it stood by commitments to find ways to avoid triggering the Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border in Ireland, in their Brexit deal and that this pledge had legal weight.
Earlier this month, May spoke with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to secure concessions from Brussels to help get her Brexit deal through parliament. She has also spoken to Germany's Angela Merkel twice in recent weeks.

May's office said at that time the prime minister was speaking to several European leaders to secure further reassurances ahead of the vote.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2019 12:06AM ET</span>",Strike by thousands of junior New Zealand doctors cripples hospitals,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 80 percent of junior doctors across New Zealand walked off the job at public hospitals on Tuesday after a breakdown in union talks with the government over working conditions and wages.
The strike spotlights the difficulties Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government faces in delivering on its promise to pour money into social services and rein in economic inequality when it took office in 2017.
The center-left government's traditional union support base says sluggish wage growth and soaring living costs have left workers struggling, with teachers, nurses and court officials taking action last year to demand pay hikes.
""They want to have control over when we work, how we work and where we work,"" said Dr Deborah Powell, national secretary of the junior doctors' union. ""We tried to resolve this without a strike but we were left with no choice."" 
More than 3,300 government-employed junior doctors, of a national tally of 3,700, are staying away from hospitals and clinics after the talks broke down last week.
Some gathered at street corners holding placards calling for better working hours but there were no major demonstrations.
Thousands of surgeries, non-essential appointments, and other services have been canceled, although emergency and life-saving services will continue as senior doctors are asked to step in.
Government hospitals asked people to limit visits only to emergencies. 
Junior doctors, or resident medical officers, want to stick with existing employment contracts because they say new terms the government proposes would mean longer shifts and allow doctors to be moved to other hospitals without notice.
Their union said it had been in talks with the District Health Board (DHB) for more than a year in which payment for overtime, weekend and night shifts were also discussed.
DHB spokesman Dr Peter Bramley disputed claims that the agency wanted to move doctors around the country at will.
""DHBs are committed to being good employers supporting safe care and safe working conditions,"" Bramley said. All DHBs would implement contingency plans to provide essential services during the strike, he said.
The union has already called for a second 48-hour strike for Jan. 29-30 in the hope of increasing pressure on the government.
The government is also holding talks to avert another strike this year by tens of thousands of school teachers after they rejected a pay offer.

Central American migrant caravans have become a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, as President Donald Trump has remained adamant that the migrants will be barred from crossing the border.
Television footage on Monday showed several hundred people in the violent city of San Pedro Sula huddled together and waving Honduran flags as they began a journey that will likely take weeks or even months to reach the U.S.-Mexico border.
Between 600 and 800 Hondurans have joined the caravan, according to an estimate provided by Miroslava Serpas, head of migrant affairs with the CIPRODEH human rights research center that is accompanying the group. 
Last October, another migrants caravan left Honduras made up of men, women and children, mostly claiming that they were fleeing entrenched poverty and gangland violence back home. 
While some 2,500 people from that caravan remain in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, more than 7,000 have returned to Honduras, according to Honduran officials.
""I'm determined to find a good job in the United States,"" said 24-year-old caravan member Darwin Perez.
""It's a difficult road ahead but I hope President Trump's heart might soften, and that he won't be so hard and will let us enter,"" he added.
Other migrants, some traveling with spouses and children, echoed Perez's dream to find work in the United States.
Trump has repeatedly vowed to stop the Central American caravans, sending troops to reinforce the border and describing the migrants as an invading force.

OSLO (Reuters) - Antarctica's annual ice losses have accelerated six-fold in the past 40 years in a trend that could push sea levels meters higher in coming centuries amid man-made global warming, scientists said on Monday.
They said the East Antarctic ice sheet is thawing at the fringes and adding to rising seas, unlike many past reports which have concluded that the eastern sheet has so far resisted a melt seen on the western side.
Ice losses from the frozen continent surged to a net 252 billion tonnes a year in the period 2009-17 from an average 40 billion tonnes from 1979-90, according to the study in the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Overall, the scientists said that the melt of Antarctica added water equivalent to 13.2 millimeters (0.5 inch) of sea level rise over the past four decades.
""That's just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak,"" said Eric Rignot, a professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine, who led other scientists in France, the Netherlands and the United States.
""As the Antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away, we expect multi-metre sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries"" with continued man-made global warming, he wrote in a statement.
Global sea levels have risen about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century and many other studies have shown a faster thaw from Greenland to Antarctica, threatening coasts from Bangladesh to Florida and cities from London to Shanghai.
The PNAS study estimated that Antarctica lost 169 billion tonnes of ice from 1992-2017, above the 109 billion tonnes in the same period estimated last year by a large international team of researchers.
The gap was mainly because the PNAS study estimated that East Antarctica lost 57 billion tonnes over the period compared to a 5 billion tonne gain in last year's estimates. Ice sheets can gain mass if snowfall exceeds losses of ice.
Co-author Michiel van den Broeke, a professor of Polar Meteorology at Utrecht University, said the thaw of Wilkes Land in East Antarctica was an emerging area of science.
""It's extremely important to find out what is happening there,"" he told Reuters. 

Antarctica contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 57 meters if it ever all melted, a process that would require far higher temperatures than now and thousands of years.

A long manufacturing boom has saddled China with millions of tonnes of waste, much of which is buried in sprawling landfill sites or dismantled by hand in polluting backstreet workshops. It has vowed to tackle the problem by creating fully industrialized recycling bases and cutting off foreign supplies.
""Large volumes of solid waste are already impacting and restricting the high-quality development of the industrial economy,"" the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a policy document issued late last week. 
It said 50 new ""comprehensive utilization"" bases would deal with bulk solid waste and another 50 with industrial waste from sectors such as metals production, coal mining, construction, agriculture and forestry.
The bases will tackle waste with the biggest public impact, the ministry said, citing shared bicycles, packaging, batteries and solar panels as examples. They will also promote advanced technologies, products and recycling methods, it added. 
Projects or companies approved to set up shop in one of these new bases can apply for special government funding, and China will also make use of new financing mechanisms, including green bonds, the document added.
China's recyclers have profited from waste shipped in from Europe and the United States, which is better sorted and therefore cheaper to treat than domestic material. 
Imports reached 60 million tonnes a year at their peak, but the government has been steadily blocking shipments since 2017.
The initial 2017 ban on 24 types of imported waste, including plastic and paper, was extended at the end of 2018 to 16 new products, including scrap ships and automobile parts. 
It said in December that it would also ban imports of more varieties of scrap steel, copper and aluminum from July, and another 16 products - including scrap stainless steel and titanium - will be blocked at the end of the year.
Total solid waste imports fell 48 percent on the year in 2018, and China eventually aims to block all imports that have readily available domestic replacements.
Many domestic recyclers have tried to move their facilities to Southeast Asia, despite tougher restrictions in Malaysia and elsewhere, and while some have started to switch to domestic feedstock, China still needs to do more to standardize and scale up the treatment of local waste.

""Some items just can't be imported anymore, including plastics ... but domestic waste and imports are handled by different people, and they are not part of the same system,"" said Wang Wang, secretary general of the China Scrap Plastic Association.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun plans to pursue an education, get a job and ""live a normal life"" in Canada - things she said she could not do in her home of Saudi Arabia, which she fled fearing for her life, she told Canadian media on Monday. 
Being in Canada is ""a very good feeling,"" she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation two days after arriving in Toronto from Bangkok. 
""It's something that is worth the risk I took.""
Qunun grabbed international attention last week after she barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to resist being sent home to her family, which denies abusing her. Qunun refused to meet her father and brother, who arrived in Bangkok to try to take her back to Saudi Arabia. 
The United Nations High Commission on Refugees granted her refugee status, and Canada agreed to take her in. 
Canada's decision to grant Qunun asylum comes at a delicate time. Relations between Ottawa and Riyadh have been tense after Canada demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists last year. Saudi Arabia retaliated by freezing new trade with Ottawa and forcing many of its students to return to the kingdom.
Qunun's case has drawn global attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" in order to travel, something rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
In her CBC interview, Qunun said: ""I felt that I could not achieve my dreams that I wanted as long as I was still living in Saudi Arabia.""
Having come to Canada, ""I felt that I was reborn, especially when I felt the love and the welcome,"" she said. 
In her new home, ""I will try things I haven't tried. I will learn things I didn't learn. I will explore life. ... I will have a job and live a normal life.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was interested in directing a movie about his life story as early as 2007, long before his well-known meeting with U.S. actor Sean Penn and Mexican actress Kate Del Castillo in 2015, jurors in Guzman's U.S. trial heard on Monday.
Alex Cifuentes, Guzman's self-described one-time ""right hand man,"" said he learned about a planned movie project while living with Guzman in the mountains of his boss' home state of Sinaloa from 2007 to 2009.
Colombian-born Cifuentes is one of about a dozen witnesses who have so far testified against Guzman after striking deals with U.S. prosecutors, in a trial that has provided a window into the secretive world of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the world's most powerful drug trafficking organization.
On trial in federal court in Brooklyn since November, Guzman, 61, was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the cartel. 
The alleged kingpin's silver screen dreams first surfaced after Penn wrote a story for Rolling Stone magazine in 2016 about traveling with Del Castillo to meet Guzman at a forest hideout, not long after Guzman had escaped from a Mexican prison through a tunnel.
Del Castillo, who once played a drug trafficker in a well-known Mexican TV soap, revealed soon after the article was published that the meeting came about because Guzman's lawyers had reached out to her about a possible movie.
When Guzman was eventually recaptured in 2016, Mexico's then-Attorney General Arely Gomez said his contact with ""actresses and producers"" was an ""important aspect that helped locate him.""
Cifuentes' own wife first urged Guzman to make a biopic around 2007, Cifuentes said on Monday. Cifuentes said Guzman hired a Colombian producer and planned a book tie-in, and the project got as far as a draft that was shown to his lawyers.
In his testimony, Cifuentes also offered jurors a glimpse of Guzman's life as a fugitive in the mountains. On a typical day, Cifuentes said, Guzman got up at noon, received messages from his personal secretary and then made calls while strolling under the trees.
Cifuentes said that Guzman ordered him to kill the cartel's communications expert, Christian Rodriguez, after learning that he was cooperating with the FBI. 

Cifuentes said he was unable to track down Rodriguez, who now lives in the United States and testified at the trial last week, because he did not know his last name.

BEIJING/OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Monday sentenced a Canadian man to be executed for drug smuggling, prompting Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accuse China of using the death penalty arbitrarily.
The ruling, and Trudeau's reaction, could aggravate already sour relations between Beijing and Ottawa following the arrest of a Chinese executive in Canada and China's subsequent detention of two Canadians.
The Dalian Intermediate People's Court in China's Liaoning province re-tried Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had appealed his original 15-year prison sentence, and decided on execution, the court said in a statement.
Schellenberg was told in court he had the right to appeal to Liaoning High Court within 10 days upon receiving the ruling, the intermediate court said in a second statement.
""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply (the) death penalty ... as in this case,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
Late on Monday, Canada's foreign ministry updated its travel advisory for China to warn citizens about ""the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws.""
It added: ""We continue to advise all Canadians traveling to China to exercise a high degree of caution.""
Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, said the family's worst fears had been confirmed.
""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time. It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation.""
In a second statement sent hours later, she said ""the Schellenberg family requests that all Canadians stand with us and pray for the safe return of our loved one.""
China-Canada ties turned icy in early December after Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], was arrested in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition warrant.
China warned of unspecified consequences unless Meng was released, and detained Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on unpaid leave from the embassy in Beijing, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian consultant, on suspicion of endangering state security.
Beijing has not drawn a direct link between the detentions and the arrest of Meng, wanted by U.S. authorities for allegedly misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions. Western diplomats say the cases are a tit-for-tat reprisal.
Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Canada, suggested in a newspaper article last week the arrest of Kovrig and Spavor was ""China's self-defense,"" but gave no details.
Earlier on Monday, Beijing dismissed Trudeau's statement that Kovrig enjoyed some form of diplomatic immunity.
A foreign ministry spokeswoman said Trudeau should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic ties so as to ""not become a laughing stock.""
Trudeau said Ottawa ""will continue to engage strongly"" with Beijing over Kovrig's status and what he called China's arbitrary use of justice.
222 KG OF METHAMPHETAMINE
Rights groups condemned the Schellenberg sentence while Guy St-Jacques, who was Canada's ambassador in Beijing when Kovrig worked there, expressed concern at how quickly the courts had acted.
""The Canadian government will make representations in Beijing, but based on past experience I am not sure whether this will work,"" he told the CBC. ""We are in a very difficult place.""
William Nee of Amnesty International noted drug-related offences did not meet the threshold of the ""most serious crimes"" to which the death penalty must be restricted under international law.
Drug smuggling is routinely punished severely in China. Beijing has previously executed foreign nationals convicted of drug-related crimes - a Briton was executed in 2009.
The court said Schellenberg had conspired with others in an attempt to smuggle 222 kg (489.43 lb) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in 2014.
Chinese state television said in an earlier report that Schellenberg argued he was a tourist visiting China and was framed by criminals. 
A lawyer for Schellenberg, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters his client would probably appeal against the death sentence.

Beijing considers the number of people executed in China to be a state secret. International human rights organizations estimate the annual figure at around 2,000.

BARRON, Wis. (Reuters) - The Wisconsin man accused of kidnapping a 13-year-old girl after murdering her parents then holding her hostage for months, sometimes under his bed, told police he picked his victim after seeing her get on a school bus, prosecutors said on Monday.
Authorities said Jake Patterson, 21, had confessed to killing Jayme Closs' father with a shotgun while the teen and her mother hid in a bathtub, then killing the mother after forcing her to help duct-tape her daughter's mouth shut.
The October discovery of the parents' bodies in the family home in rural Barron, Wisconsin, with the door blasted open and their daughter gone, sparked a search by hundreds of police officers and thousands of volunteers. That ended Thursday when Closs escaped after 88 days and sought help from a woman walking her dog.
At a brief hearing in Barron County Circuit Court on Monday, Patterson appeared via live video from jail, wearing an orange jumpsuit and glasses. He had a copy of the criminal complaint in front of him and calmly offered brief yes-or-no answers to questions from the judge.
Patterson will be held on $5 million bail and is scheduled to appear in court again on Feb. 6. He faces first-degree murder charges for the killings of James and Denise Closs, as well as kidnapping and burglary counts.
Authorities have not yet explained why Patterson felt so drawn to Closs that he committed a double murder to capture her.
Asked whether Closs was the victim of sexual abuse, Barron County District Attorney Brian Wright declined to comment. Prosecutors said additional charges stemming from Douglas County, where Patterson's house is located, remained possible.
""We're so grateful for Jayme and her safe return, and now it's time for us to obtain justice for her,"" Wright said.
Defense lawyers did not address reporters after the hearing.
WEEKS OF PREPARATION
Patterson told police that he spotted the teen outside her home while he was driving to a short-lived job at a local cheese factory. She was getting on the school bus, and ""he knew that was the girl he was going to take,"" according to court documents.
He prepared for the abduction by buying a ski mask, shaving his head so as not to leave any hair evidence and replacing his license plates with stolen ones. Twice he drove to the house but was scared off after seeing lights on and people there, prosecutors said.
Jayme Closs told police she was awakened on Oct. 15 when the family dog began barking and got her parents up as a car entered their driveway.
Dressed in black, Patterson shot James Closs through the front door while Jayme and her mother, Denise Closs, barricaded themselves in a bathroom, authorities said.
After kicking down the door, Patterson ordered Denise Closs to tape up her daughter, then shot her dead and dragged Jayme into the trunk of his car, he told police.
On the way to his cabin in Gordon, Wisconsin, about 66 miles (106 km) north of Barron, Patterson drove past several police cars responding to reports of the shooting, according to the criminal complaint. 
During her months in captivity, Patterson often trapped Closs under his bed for hours when he left the house or had visitors, using plastic boxes and barbells to make it harder for her to get out, he told police. He threatened violence if she tried to escape.
Closs managed to push her way out on Thursday after Patterson said he would be away for a few hours, she told police. She put on a pair of his shoes and walked outside, where she encountered the woman walking her dog.
The two then approached a neighbor's house to call police. While they waited for officers to arrive, the neighbor, Peter Kasinskas, retrieved his gun and stood watch at the door in case her captor was searching for her, according to the Duluth News Tribune.

Soon after, police stopped Patterson, who told investigators he had been driving around looking for Closs.

Venezuela's Maduro exclaims amid Brazil spat,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday called Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a modern Adolf Hitler, days after Brasilia officially recognized an opposition leader as the legitimate head of the increasingly isolated country. 
Brazil on Saturday said it recognized Juan Guaido, head of Venezuela's opposition-run Congress, as legitimate president after Maduro was sworn in to a second term that countries around the world described as illegitimate.
""Over there we've got Brazil in the hands of a fascist - Bolsonaro is a Hitler of the modern era!"" Maduro said during a state of the nation speech. 
""Let's leave the task of Bolsonaro to the wonderful people of Brazil, who will fight and take care of him.""
The Brazilian president's office said through a spokeswoman that it would not comment.
Guaido on Friday had said he was willing to assume the presidency after opposition leaders said Maduro's second term was illegitimate because the broadly boycotted 2018 elections were rigged in his favor.
Guaido, who was briefly detained by intelligence agents on his way to a political rally on Sunday, has not declared himself president.
Brazil and Venezuela maintained cordial relations for over a decade thanks to friendly ties between Brazil's Workers Party and Venezuela's Socialist Party.

Bolsonaro, a fervent anti-communist who has praised his country's 1964-85 military dictatorship, has promised to target Venezuela.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The main jihadist group in northwest Syria said on Monday it did not seek to dominate the Idlib region, after it cemented its grip on the last rebel-held bastion, putting a deal to avert a Russian-led army assault on the area at risk.
Abu Mohammad al Golani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS), led by the former Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda, said its goal was a unified civilian administration in Idlib that brings stability and ends lawlessness.
""We don't have the aim of ruling the liberated north. We want to hand over all our areas to a civilian government,"" he told HTS-affiliated Amjad news agency in his first comments since the latest round of infighting. 
Last week the jihadist group, listed as terrorists by the United States, Turkey and others, forced factions from the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) to accept a peace deal recognizing civilian control by an HTS-backed administration. 
The rise of Hayat Tahrir al Sham has prompted worries by Turkey and the mainstream rebels they support that the latest gains by the hardline Islamists in Idlib region would give Moscow the pretext to renege on a peace deal struck in Sochi in September.
The agreement puts the onus on Turkey to ensure banned Islamist groups are expelled from a frontline buffer zone.
The jihadists have allowed Turkish troops to deploy along the front lines as the Russia-Turkey deal demanded, but have not pulled out of the area.
Golani said southern Syria and Eastern Ghouta had been in the hands of moderate Western-backed groups and not jihadists when the Russians and their Syrian army allies launched devastating military campaigns last year to end opposition control.
""The enemy that strikes children, women and hospitals does not need a excuse to enter an area and hit,"" Golani said.
""We should not try to justify to the enemy we are kind hearted people who deserve to live in this area, this is war,"" he said. 
Russia on Friday said it remained committed to the agreement it had struck with Turkey to stabilize a de-escalation zone in Idlib, but was worried by an increase in the number of ceasefire violations.

Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar who visited the border area adjoining Idlib along with the chief of general staff and the intelligence agency reassured Russia his country was ""making every effort to preserve the ceasefire and stability in Idlib"".

The Barcelona Maritime Authority, in a letter seen by Reuters, said the charity Proactiva Open Arms had violated international agreements that rescued migrants should be taken to the closest port available. 
The minority Socialist Party government has accepted hundreds of migrants rescued by Open Arms this year but anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise in Spain, which has seen a surge in people making the dangerous crossing by sea.
Open Arms, which operates in the waters between southern Europe and Libya, has previously traveled to Spain to disembark migrants after being refused permission to do so in Italy and Malta.
""Measures were not taken to ensure the disembarkment took place as quickly as reasonably possible. In contrast, the boat had to wait with a large number of people on board and subsequently travel for several days crossing the Mediterranean to arrive to a safe port,"" the letter reads.
Open Arms will not be granted permission to resume rescue operations ""until an agreement with the authorities of the relevant SAR [search and rescue] zones is in place,"" the letter continued.
The Barcelona Maritime Authority, which is part of the Ministry of Public Works, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Open Arms said on Monday it had appealed the decision.
""Preventing us from saving lives is irresponsible and cruel. Cowardly politicians have set the counter of deaths running,"" Open Arms founder Oscar Camps wrote on Twitter on Monday.
As of November last year, more than 600 African migrants had died trying to reach Spain since the start of the year, almost three times more than in all of 2017.
Irregular immigration by sea has fallen on average across Europe, though arrivals to Spain have more than doubled annually to the rate of more than 1,000 people per week this year.

In December, Vox became the first far-right, anti-immigrant party to win representation in a regional assembly in Spain since the end of the Franco dictatorship in the late 1970s.

The Union of South American Nations, or Unasur, was created 10 years ago by late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez to counteract the influence of the United States in the region as a wave of leftist leaders held sway over the region's politics.
But mounting criticism that Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, is undermining democracy, as well as a general rightward shift in the region, led Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Peru to suspend their participation in the group.
The new group, called Prosur, would seek to counteract the influence of what countries in the region call a dictatorship in Venezuela.
""We've been advancing toward the end of Unasur and the creation of Prosur ... a South American platform for the coordination of public policies, the defense of democracy, independent institutions, and market economies,"" Duque said in a radio interview. 
""It is very important that (Unasur), which has been a supporter of the dictatorship of Venezuela, be shut down,"" Duque said.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The troubled nation's economic crisis has caused an exodus of 3 million people since 2015, according to the United Nations, the vast majority of which have gone to neighboring Colombia.

Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries with the help of the United States, which has levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro's government and top officials.

The announcement ended months of political uncertainty over the ballot which was marred by chaotic organization, allegations of massive fraud and attacks by insurgents that caused the vote to continue for a second day.
It also came as diplomatic efforts between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives to find a peace settlement to end the war in Afghanistan, which has dragged on for more than 17 years, gained momentum.
Gula Jan Abdul Bade Sayad, chairman of the Independent Election Commission (IEC), apologized on Monday for delaying the announcement of the preliminary results and said more time was required to go through the ballot.
The final results are expected to be announced in the coming weeks after a review by the electoral complaints commission.
""Widespread irregularities during the election day, dealing with incomplete voter lists and many other reasons were unfortunately the cause of delay and it required more time to deal with it,"" Sayad told a news conference in Kabul.
The vote, held on Oct. 20 after months of wrangling and delay, was marred by accusations of voter fraud, ballot-box stuffing, technical problems with biometric voter verification equipment and inaccurate voter lists.

The Presidential election, originally scheduled for April, was put back until July this year and many Afghans believe the vote may be canceled if a peace deal is reached with the Taliban.

KABUL (Reuters) - At least four people were killed and 90 wounded when a bomb-laden car blew up near a high-security compound in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday, officials said.
An Afghan government security official said the blast occurred on Jalalabad Road in eastern Kabul near the Green Village compound, home to several international companies and charities.
""Most of the victims were civilians,"" said Najib Danish, an Interior Ministry spokesman. Twenty-three children were among the injured, he added.
Police spokesman Basir Mujahid said a vehicle full of explosives had been detonated. ""The area is cordoned off ... and search operation underway for suspects and attackers,"" he said.
""It was a powerful car bomb that knocked (down) a wall between Green Village and the customs office,"" a security source said. 
Hayat Khan was having dinner with his family at his home when the explosion shattered the windows.
""All of my family are wounded. They have received injuries on the head, hands, legs and on the neck,"" he said.
Khan and his family were being treated at the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, where a Reuters witness saw dozens of severely injured people who had been rushed there from the blast site.
An official at Kabul's Emergency Hospital said 15 wounded had been brought there.
A senior Interior Ministry official said the explosion destroyed at least three checkpoints.
""Residential buildings nearby have sustained heavy damage and several private guards around the Green Village checkpoints were critically injured,"" the official said. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. Green Village has come under Islamist militant attack in the past.
The latest attack comes as U.S. special peace envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad tours the region for meetings aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war in Afghanistan.
Last week, Taliban leaders called off a fourth round of talks with U.S. officials in Qatar due to an ""agenda disagreement"" and refused to allow what they called ""puppet"" Afghan government officials join the talk.
There has been no lull in fighting even as the talks intensify and the Taliban carry out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting security forces, government officials and civilians as human shields. 

The last major attack in the capital took place in late December when 43 were killed inside a government compound targeted by a suicide bomber and extremists armed with assault rifles. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.

The fate of the United Kingdom's March 29 exit from the EU is deeply uncertain as parliament is likely to reject May's deal on Tuesday, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly divorce to reversing Brexit altogether.
Weber, leader of the European People's Party in the European Parliament, told Reuters the deal could not be improved.
""The invitation is still there to our British colleagues, please vote in favor - take the outstretched hand of the European Union so that there is as little damage as possible on March 29,"" he said.
""It is a good offer and there won't be any renegotiation.""
On Monday, Spain's foreign minister said the EU could agree to extend the deadline for Brexit, but not beyond elections for the European Parliament due in May.
Weber could not imagine Britain taking part in the election, suggesting he agreed that Brexit must be wrapped up by May.
""It is hard to imagine that Britain, a country that is leaving the European Union, could take part in the elections for the European Parliament for the next five years,"" he said.
Weber said it was not right to speculate about a possible extension of the deadline for Brexit before Tuesday's vote in London.
""But what is clear is that any debate about an extension only makes sense if we have new circumstances - if something changes, if the debate changes, if we get clearer goals from Britain in which direction the negotiations should go in the future,"" he said.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Macron 2.0: French president seeks reset button with national debate,"By Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - To his allies, Emmanuel Macron's letter to the French launching a national policy debate was a bold exercise in democracy. To his critics, Sunday's missive was an empty, wordy gesture by an aloof 'King Macron' determined to retain core economic reforms.
Whatever their initial reaction, the French have eight weeks to respond by contributing thoughts on an array of subjects in an initiative the president hopes will generate policy ideas and help build a new ""contract"" with the nation.
That he felt the need to pen a 2,300-word letter launching a consultation reflects the extent to which the ""yellow vest"" uprising has shaken his presidency.
Before Macron's letter, only two other French presidents, Francois Mitterrand and Nicolas Sarkozy, had penned missives to the people. Both were electoral gambits, announcing their run for a second term in the Elysee Palace.
Macron's in contrast came after less than two years in power and sought to begin healing relations with a public angry at the 41-year-old's liberal economic reforms and monarchical manner.
His letter insisted he would not reverse reforms aimed at making France Inc. more attractive and ensuring work pays more. The initiative, he said, was ""neither an election, nor a referendum"" on his leadership. Opponents were unimpressed.
""With this address, the head of state is in fact a candidate, to save the three years he has left in office,"" the left-leaning daily Liberation wrote in its Monday editorial.
""Resuming a conversation with the people won't be easy. And, if we dare say, will require of the president a certain 'taste for effort',"" the paper added, sniping at Macron's remarks on Friday that too many French did not know the meaning of hard graft.
The debate will focus on four themes -- taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship. Discussions will be held on the internet and in town halls over a period of two months. Four weeks after that, in April, Macron will return with his conclusions.
""The 'yellow vests' want responses to their demands. Here is a wordy letter that pushes back any answers to later in a bid to win time,"" Green lawmaker Esther Benbassa said on Twitter. ""The people will ask. King Macron will decide.""
LACKING EMPATHY
Riot police in Paris on Saturday fired water canon and tear gas in a ninth weekend of clashes with mobs of projectile-hurling ""yellow Vest"" protesters. Thousands of others marched noisily but peacefully through the capital.
Macron, often criticized for being disconnected with low-paid workers who struggle to make ends meet, says he wants to channel their anger into solutions.
Investors balked at Macron's first round of tax and minimum wage concessions, which cost the Treasury 10 billion euros and undermined his credentials as a reformer. 
Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer hailed the nationwide consultation as an ""unprecedented"" democratic exercise.
Asked in an interview on France Inter radio if Macron's reforms were moribund, Blanquer said: ""Of course we have to keep reforming. Of course reform is possible.""
Beyond policy, however, Macron also faces the challenge of persuading the public to like him once again. His sharp tongue, patronizing remarks to the working class and habit of listening to only a small coterie of close advisors have helped drive his popularity ratings to new lows. 
Macron's letter said he heard the public's anger and shared its impatience for a ""more prosperous country and a fairer society"".
But in refusing to re-examine tax reforms that have exposed him to charges of being a ""president of the rich"" -- he scrapped a wealth tax and lowered the rate on capital gains -- the former investment banker, was again depicted as aloof. 

""The letter contains too little emotion, too little empathy,"" said Florian Silnicki, head of communications consultancy firm LaFrenchCom. ""It doesn't breathe enough humanity.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Pawel Adamowicz, the liberal mayor of the Polish city of Gdansk, died on Monday of his wounds a day after being stabbed by a former convict who rushed the stage during one of Poland's biggest annual charity events. 
""We couldn't win,"" Poland's health minister Lukasz Szumowski told reporters via private broadcaster TVN. Doctors had operated on Adamowicz for five hours, state news agency PAP said. 
Polish officials said the day of Adamowicz's funeral would be a national day of mourning. 
Television footage showed thousands of people gathering for commemorative vigils across the country on Monday, including in the cities of Gdansk, Poznan and the capital Warsaw.
Adamowicz was attacked while attending the annual Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which raises money for medical equipment in hospitals. The head of the charity resigned soon after Adamowicz's death was announced. 
Television footage of the attack showed a man screaming ""Adamowicz is dead!"" as he rushed the stage and stabbed the mayor, who crumpled to the floor. 
Speaking on the stage before he was arrested, the attacker accused the mayor's former party of putting him in prison, where he said he was tortured.
The attacker has been identified by Polish authorities as a 27-year-old named Stefan, who was released last month from prison where he had been serving 5-1/2 years for a 2014 conviction for attempted bank robbery. His full name has so far been withheld.
Psychiatrists will assess if the attacker can be held criminally responsible for his actions, prosecutor Krzysztof Sierak told a news conference. 
""This is a person who has a personality disorder, but he isn't mentally ill. If he was mentally ill, he would have been diagnosed earlier as he was already convicted of four crimes,"" said Wojciech Sledzinski, a psychiatrist and director of the Mental Health and Addiction Center in Krakow told Reuters.
UNITY
The event at which Adamowicz was murdered has raised more than a billion zlotys for charity over 27 years but has been criticized by Poland's conservative ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party because of the liberal philosophy it espouses, including its former motto, ""Do what you want"". 
Poland's President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, urged unity in the face of violence, saying many Poles were united despite their political differences by ""their desire to do good"".
""On this day, something unimaginably bad happened,"" Duda told a news conference. 
PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski and opposition politicians condemned the stabbing. Adamowicz was an outspoken opponent of PiS. 
""I'm expressing great pain for the tragic death due to the criminal attack on mayor Pawel Adamowicz. We express solidarity with his family,"" Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the PiS leader, was quoted as saying in a tweet by the party spokeswoman.
Adamowicz stood out for his initiatives to encourage migrants to seek refuge in the northern Polish city, and for his support of a protest campaign to defend the rule of law in Poland against what activists consider efforts by the PiS to increase its control over the judiciary and other bodies. 

Adamowicz was one of Poland's longest-serving mayors, holding his position in Gdansk since 1998. In the 2018 regional election, he won 65 percent of votes.

The leftist president, sworn in for a six-year term on Jan. 10, has faced growing international sanctions since winning re-election last May in a vote widely considered fraudulent. This has cut Venezuela off from foreign financing and left his government with few friends abroad.
Maduro said last week he planned new economic measures, but has not given any details of what he will announce on Monday. The president is expected to speak at around 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT) before an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly to present his plan.
Critics in the United States and Latin America, as well as political opponents at home, have called Maduro a dictator whose failed state-led policies have caused Venezuela's worst ever economic crisis. Maduro counters that he is victim of a U.S.-led ""economic war"" aimed at ousting him from power.
The size of the economy has halved during five years of recession, annual inflation is nearly 2 million percent, and widespread shortages of food and medicine have spurred three million Venezuelans to emigrate since 2015.
In August, Maduro's government introduced several economic measures to try to tackle the crisis, devaluing the bolivar currency and lifting the minimum wage and taxes. But economists say the measures were too limited to have a significant impact.

As Maduro's second term got underway, the leader of the country's opposition-led Congress, Juan Guaido, said last week he was willing to replace Maduro with the support of the military. Several government officials have said Guaido should be arrested for treason and on Sunday he was briefly detained by intelligence agents.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Protesters in Ethiopia's northeastern Afar region have blocked the landlocked country's main route to the sea to demonstrate against surging ethnic violence, organizers said on Monday.
The demonstrators started a five-day blockade of the highway to neighboring Djibouti on Sunday, Mahi Bule, a member of an organizing committee said.
Djibouti handles roughly 95 percent of all inbound trade for Ethiopia, a nation of 105 million and an economic power in East Africa.
Nearly 3 million people were displaced last year due to clashes between ethnic groups. Critics of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April, say his political reforms had allowed dormant ethnic rivalries to resurface in Africa's second-most populous nation. 
The 42-year-old has signed a peace deal with Eritrea, released political prisoners, and moved to open up the state-controlled economy and overhaul the security services.
But the sudden changes in a nation where political dissent has long been repressed have inspired many of its myriad ethnic groups to jockey for power and influence. 
The latest deadly clashes between ethnic Afars and Issa Somalis, who are a minority in the area, broke out in December. Locals say dozens have been killed. 
Afar elders said the attacks were an attempt to break away areas inhabited by Issas away from the region. An Afar rebel group said the attacks were supported by ethnic Somalis from Djibouti and Somalia. Afars majority. Isse minority 
Protesters were demonstrating against violence and a government order for local militias to pull out from disputed areas and be replaced by federal soldiers.

Kinfe Dagnew was arrested along with dozens of other employees of the METEC two months ago. The new charges relate to the procurement of ships from state-run Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Enterprise. 
Prosecutors Fetihu Nuri and Habite Mariam charged Kinfe and 13 codefendants with wasting 554 million Ethiopian birr of public funds ($20 million) on unwarranted repairs and administrative costs when ordering the vessels. The case was adjourned until Jan. 28. 
He is the most senior official charged as part of a nationwide crackdown on graft in the public sector after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office last year. Abiy vowed to clean up state-owned firms and the military, and canceled many METEC contracts, including one for supplying of turbines for the nearly $5 billion Grand Renaissance Dam.
Abiy is Ethiopia’s first leader from its majority Oromo ethnic group. He was chosen by the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), as its new head after three years of street protests and strikes piled pressure on it to reform.
Kinfe was arrested on the border with Sudan and Eritrea after a months-long investigation into METEC, which uncovered suspicious procurement practices involving more than $2 billion.

Kinfe already faces four counts of corruption at the Lideta High Court in Addis Ababa related to the procurement of tractors.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Several thousand garment workers took to the streets in Bangladesh on Monday, rejecting a pay hike in the crucial export industry as insufficient, police and union leaders said.
Garment owners agreed to raise workers' pay on Sunday after a week of violent demonstrations in which one person was killed and dozens wounded as police used teargas and water cannon to disperse workers who blocked roads and vandalized vehicles and factories.
The protests are a test for the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won a third straight term in a Dec. 30 election, which was marred by violence and allegations of widespread rigging and voter intimidation.
Workers from up to 10 factories tried to block a highway in the Ashulia garment manufacturing belt on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka,"" said Saminur Rahman, a director for the Industrial Police, which patrols the country's business hubs.
""We dispersed them immediately and all other factories are open,"" he added.
Though many have returned to work, most employees remain unhappy with the pay rise proposed as basic salaries were not raised as expected, union leaders said.
""We had to accept it as the proposal came from our prime minister. How can we dishonor it?"" Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation president Babul Akter said.
""We urged all workers to resume work. We hope the prime minister will ensure our proper wages in near future,"" he added.
Garment owners said the rise put an extra burden on them which small factories will find difficult to afford, urging global brands to pay more for the clothes they buy.
Low wages and trade deals with Western countries have turned Bangladesh's garments sector into a $30 billion industry accounting for 80 percent of the country's exports, with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) and H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB (ST:HMb) buying clothes from its factories.
""We have agreed to the new wages for the greater interest for the sector,"" said Siddiqur Rahman, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association.
""Through increasing productivity, we will have to adjust to the rise,"" he said, adding: ""At the same time, international brands will have to share the rising costs.""
The government said in September that the minimum wage for garment workers would increase by up to 51 percent to 8,000 taka ($95) a month, payable in January, the first increase since 2013.

But union leaders say that increase will benefit only a small percentage of workers in the garment sector, which employs 4 million out of the country's 165 million people.

The Central Bohemian court sentenced Jaromir Balda to four years in jail and ordered him to undergo psychiatric treatment, according to video on news website. 
Balda felled trees onto railway lines north of Prague causing two trains to derail. No-one was hurt. He left behind leaflets in Arabic reading ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest).
Balda said he had aimed to stoke public resistance to accepting migrants, media reported.
He was the first man to be convicted under Czech terrorism laws, according to state attorney Martin Bily.
There has been no significant growth in the number of asylum seekers entering the Czech Republic despite a sharp rise in immigration to Europe in 2015 which raised public debate over accepting migrants from the Middle East and north Africa.
The Czech Republic has rejected attempts by fellow EU countries to force member states to accept a quota system for the relocation of migrants and refugees.
Judge Jiri Wazik said Balda had been manipulated by public figures who preyed on people's gullibility and fear.
""The defendant is in a way a victim of this manipulation, however that does not mean he is not criminally and humanly responsible for his actions. Perhaps he should have realized that hate breeds more hate,"" the judge said in the video footage.
Czech media said Balda had made donations to the far-right, anti-Islam SPD party. The party condemned Balda's actions on its website.
Balda and the state attorney can appeal the verdict.

LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Global health teams battling the world's second largest Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo fear an election dispute may deepen public mistrust and allow the epidemic to run out of control.
Fostering confidence in health authorities is essential when fighting a disease that can spread furiously through communities where local services are scant and patients are often scared to come forward to government or international response teams.
""When you have political instability, public health always suffers,"" said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who recently visited east Congo with a World Health Organization leadership team.
Without public trust, he said, the Congo epidemic could kill many hundreds more people.
The Dec. 30 election was supposed to mark Congo's first uncontested democratic transfer of power after 18 years of chaotic rule by President Joseph Kabila. 
But accusations of fraud and calls for a recount are threatening more volatility and violence after opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was declared winner. 
""The worst case scenario is that political instability remains, mistrust grows ... and then there's nothing to stop the epidemic getting embedded into a big urban centre and taking off as it did in West Africa,"" said Farrar.
""GAINS COULD BE LOST""
Already, 385 people have been killed in the outbreak of Ebola in east Congo that began six months ago and has infected at least 630 people, according to WHO data. The death rate in this epidemic - by far the biggest Congo has seen, and the world's second largest in history - is more than 60 percent.
Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids. It causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. The outbreak is concentrated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.
There are some signs case numbers in the North Kivu city of Beni may be leveling off, but WHO experts are cautious. 
They say the apparent lull might be due to people getting ill but failing to seek proper diagnosis and treatment. 
The West Africa Ebola outbreak Farrar referred to lasted for two years from 2014. It infected 28,000 and killed more than 11,300 people in an epidemic that devastated Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea and spread in sporadic cases to several other African countries as well as the United States and Europe.
The WHO says the risk of the disease spreading remains ""very high"" at national and regional levels and is working urgently with Congo and its neighbors - Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan - to do everything to avoid that happening again.
WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said 25 million people have already been screened for Ebola at border checks with Congo's neighbors. Vaccination campaigns have also begun for health workers in Uganda and South Sudan.

Jasarevic also said multiple threats to response teams' ability to find, treat and prevent cases of Ebola infection make the Congo situation particularly worrisome: ""Gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity,"" he said.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>","Portugal's tourism boom halted by Brexit, airport problems","By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's long-running tourism boom is set to move decisively into reverse in 2019 due to capacity constraints at Lisbon airport and a drop in British visitors because of a Brexit-hit pound, Portugal's biggest hotel group told Reuters.
Jose Theotonio, chief executive of the Pestana Group which operates 94 hotels, said he had already noticed a dip in British guests as they turn to markets like Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia where local currencies have depreciated more than sterling.
""I hope, at some stage, there will be good judgment and a deal is reached to avoid a 'hard Brexit',"" Theotonio said in an interview. ""But Portuguese hotels are going to have to adjust prices to keep the English market.""
He predicted lower revenues from British tourists this year in key resort destinations like the Algarve and Madeira as competition from eastern Mediterranean markets hots up.
Britons are the leading tourist visitors to Portuguese hotels, representing about 15 percent of the total 13 million.
Portugal has seen a surge in tourism in recent years, benefitting from security concerns over north African destinations and relatively low prices as it bounced back from its 2010-14 debt crisis. 
Visitor numbers rose uninterruptedly for seven years to 2017, setting repeated new records, before sputtering last year.
Theotonio said tourism would also be affected by Lisbon airport reaching maximum capacity last year. 
Despite years of lobbying, an agreement was only signed last week to build a new airport and expand the current one, but the new airport still depends on environmental approval and will only be ready in 2022 if it goes ahead.
""Our biggest concern today is the construction of the new airport. The hotel confederation is only talking about this and for good reason,"" Theotonio said. 
Between 2011 and 2017 Portugal's tourism revenues doubled to 15 billion euros ($17 billion). 
But in the first 10 months of 2018, tourist arrivals slipped 0.1 percent, with British tourists down nine percent.
Revenues from British visitors to Pestana Group hotels fell seven percent in 2018.
Still, Pestana's hotel revenues rose 8 percent last year, supported by domestic demand, hotel openings, price hikes and the group's geographic diversification.
Its revenues rose to 400 million euros last year from 394 million in 2017. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reached 120 million euros from 114 million in 2017, Theotonio said.
He said the group made 70 percent of revenue at home, but expects this to decline to 50 percent in four or five years as Pestana expands abroad.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>","In Lebanon, U.S. State Department official calls Hezbollah 'unacceptable'","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department criticized Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group on Monday for digging tunnels into Israel and stockpiling rockets, as Washington steps up efforts to isolate Tehran. 
In recent weeks, Israeli forces uncovered tunnels they said were dug by Hezbollah, and Lebanon complained about Israel's construction of a barrier along disputed parts of the border.
The United States, Israel's closest ally, regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group and has pledged tougher steps to counteract Iranian influence in the region, but it has also reiterated its backing for the Lebanese government - which includes Hezbollah representatives - and army. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week vowed to expel ""every last Iranian boot"" from Syria, where Iran has been fighting alongside Hezbollah, and where Israel has been carrying out strikes against both. 
""While Lebanon has the right to defend itself, that is the right of the Lebanese state alone,"" said David Hale, U.S. under secretary of state for political affairs, after meeting Lebanese prime minister designate Saad al-Hariri. 
""It is unacceptable to have a militia outside the control of the state, and unanswerable to all people of Lebanon digging attack tunnels across the blue line to Israel or assembling an arsenal of over 100,000 missiles with which to threaten regional stability,"" he added. 
Israel, which regards Hezbollah as the biggest threat on its borders, on Sunday said it had completed efforts to find and destroy tunnels under the frontier that it said the group had dug to infiltrate fighters during a future war.
Hezbollah has not commented on the tunnels. Lebanon's National Security Council last week said an Israeli border wall that crosses into territory claimed by Lebanon, constitutes an act of aggression. 
However, both sides appear ready to contain matters for now. ""Israel's interest is to keep the (situation) quiet. I think for them (Hezbollah), that interest is even greater,"" Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot said last week after completing his term as Israeli army chief. 
OIL DISPUTE
Hezbollah was set up by Iran in the early 1980s to fight Israel's occupation of south Lebanon, but it retained its weapons after Israeli forces withdrew in 2000 and has become the strongest political force in the country. 
The last conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, fought on Lebanese soil, was in 2006. A United Nations Security Council resolution ending that conflict called for work to delineate the border, but the frontier has still not been agreed. 
The border dispute has also affected Lebanese plans to drill for oil and gas near an area of sea claimed by both countries. 
Hale's visit comes as Lebanese politicians continue to jostle over the formation of a new coalition government more than eight months after an election. 
Hezbollah is part of Lebanon's caretaker government and is expected to be included in any new coalition formed by Hariri. 

Lebanon's failure to form a new government was dragging down the economy and ""endangering the country"", Hale said, and urged the caretaker government to move forward on the economy to maintain international confidence.

The violence broke out when protesting teachers, who are on a 24-hour strike, tried to break a police cordon next to parliament. Some demonstrators hurled fireworks at police, who responded with tear gas. The clashes were short-lived.
More than 3,000 people took part in the protest, holding banners that read ""Permanent hirings now!""
The teachers say schools are under-staffed and are demanding the creation of additional permanent positions. They argue that an education ministry bill currently under public consultation is unfair to those with years of experience.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal's two best known opposition figures have been barred from running in presidential elections next month, the Constitutional Council said on Monday, increasing President Macky Sall's chances of securing a second term in office.
Khalifa Sall, a former mayor of Dakar who bears no relation to President Sall, and Karim Wade, the son of former President Abdoulaye Wade, were jailed for graft and corruption in 2018 and 2015 respectively. 
Under Senegalese law, the sentences effectively ended their chances of running in the Feb. 24 poll and the Constitutional Council confirmed this outcome on Monday. 
The opposition says the sentences were part of the president's plan to silence popular opponents so he can secure a second mandate, charges the ruling party denies. 
Both presidential hopefuls had collected more than the 53,000 supporting signatures required to run.
Khalifa remains in jail, where he is serving a five-year sentence for embezzling 1.8 billion CFA francs ($3.2 million) in public funds. He was denied an appeal by the Supreme Court earlier in January, but his lawyer plans to take the case to another chamber of the court.
Karim went into exile in Qatar in 2017 after serving half of his six-year sentence.
In a document sent to lawyers and seen by Reuters on Monday, the Constitutional Council said Khalifa and Karim's candidacies went against Senegal's electoral law, which bars citizens sentenced to more than five years in prison from running for president.
The two have 48 hours to appeal the Council's decision, which will publish a final list of approved candidates 35 days before the poll. 
Only four opposition candidates have so far been approved by the Council, including Wade's former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck. Political neophyte Ousmane Sonko is popular among Senegalese youth, which represent a significant portion of the voting population.

Senegal, a major exporter of fish and peanuts, has had three largely peaceful transitions of power since independence from France in 1960.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah and the foreign ministers of France and Iran made separate visits on Monday to Iraq, an ally of Tehran, amid U.S. attempts to rally allies against the Islamic Republic as Washington starts withdrawing troops from neighboring Syria.
King Abdullah's visit, his first since 2008, follows a week after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stopped off in both countries at the start of a Middle East tour meant to mobilize Arab countries against Iran and reassure them over the planned U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.
The Jordanian king was greeted by President Barham Salih on a red carpet at Baghdad airport before heading to meet Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. Salih welcomed the visit as strengthening ""joint interests and security"".
Pompeo, who was in Riyadh on Monday, promoted a planned Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) that would include Gulf Arab states, Jordan and Egypt. Washington is seeking to weaken Shi'ite Muslim Iran, Israel's arch-foe in the region, with renewed sanctions and the support of Sunni Arab allies.
In Iraq, Washington has made overtures to officials with vague pledges of greater economic cooperation and has pressured Baghdad to stop importing Iranian gas.
But the planned withdrawal from Syria of 2,000 U.S. troops, announced by President Donald Trump last month, alarmed U.S. allies across the region, including Israel, which worries that the move could embolden Iran.
Pompeo's tour came weeks after the announcement, and after a surprise trip by Trump to a U.S. military base in Iraq that included no meetings Iraqi leaders, prompting criticism from politicians.
Iraq's government and many state institutions have been dominated by Iran-aligned figures and groups since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran-backed Shi'ite militias which helped defeat Islamic State in 2017 are increasing their sway over territory and politics in Iraq.
Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif met Abdul Mahdi, Shi'ite Muslim political leaders and other officials on Sunday and Monday and said a visit by President Hassan Rouhani would follow in March, Iranian state news agencies reported.
The U.S. troop withdrawal has also alarmed Western allies who still see Islamic State as a threat, including France whose Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian met Abdul Mahdi on Monday.
Le Drian said the U.S. withdrawal ""raised questions"", adding that IS had not been completely destroyed in Syria yet and threatened to return in Iraq.
France had agreed a 1 billion euro loan for reconstruction in Iraq after the 2014-2017 battle to defeat the Sunni jihadists.

Iraq has signaled it could become more military involved against IS in neighboring Syria. It has carried out several air strikes against IS in Syria in agreement with Damascus.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",Libya should hold elections even if draft constitution rejected: parliament chief,"By Ayman al-Warfalli
QUBBA, Libya (Reuters) - Libya should press ahead with national elections even if voters reject a draft constitution in a planned referendum, the head of the country's internationally recognized parliament said.
The comments by Aguila Saleh could help assuage U.N. and Western concerns that the House of Representatives (HoR) might try to undermine efforts to organize elections to help end the years-long conflict in Libya.
The United Nations and Western powers hope Libya will hold its national elections by June after holding a referendum on a constitutional framework to chart a way out of the conflict, which stems from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
""Because we want a constitution (based on) consensus this will take time... We need an executive authority and there is no other choice than (electing) a temporary president (if the draft constitution is rejected),"" Saleh told Reuters in a weekend interview in his home town of Qubba in eastern Libya.
He did not mention a possible date for the elections.
A French plan, backed by the United Nations, had initially called for national elections on Dec. 10, but weeks of fighting in the capital Tripoli between rival groups and parliament's failure to approve necessary legislation made that impossible.
Libya has two governments, one in the capital Tripoli and a rival in the east allied to commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control the east. Haftar is seen as a likely contender in the next presidential election.
The High National Elections Commission (HNEC) said last month it could organize a referendum in February if it received funding from the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.
Saleh said the HoR could, if needed, secure funds from the Haftar-linked government in the east to allow the referendum on the draft constitution to go ahead.
Persuading voters to approve a draft constitution could prove very difficult in a country so deeply divided between two rival governments and parliaments and also along tribal lines.
If voters reject the draft constitution, Saleh said, a special committee should work on a new version. The current draft envisages a parliamentary system with two chambers but also with a strong presidency.

The United Nations wants to stage a national conference for Libyans in early 2019 to overcome the country's divisions and decide what type of elections they want, presidential or parliamentary.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania's High Court on Monday rejected a petition from some opposition leaders to halt parliamentary debate on draft legislation they say would criminalize many legitimate political activities and cement ""one-party"" rule.
Accusing opposition groups of trying to foment violence to derail economic reforms, President John Magufuli's government wants to amend the law governing political parties.
The changes would expand grounds on which authorities can suspend political parties and jail their members. 
Critics say that would sharply curb freedoms in the East African nation and prevent an effective challenge to Magufuli and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in next year's general election and this year's local elections.
Tanzania, a nation of 57 million people, has long been regarded as one of Africa's most stable democracies. The ruling CCM party, and its predecessor TANU, have governed since independence from Britain in 1961. 
However, since Magufuli was elected in 2015, his administration has implemented draconian curbs including banning some newspapers, restricting opposition rallies, and detaining dozens of their members. The 59-year-old has been nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"", partly for his pugnacious management style. 
That has drawn criticism from Western donors who provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually. 
Some have suspended loans or aid. 
Under the proposed legal changes, individuals conducting civic education - for example giving out information on voter registration - must seek permission from a government-appointed registrar of political parties or face a fine and up to a year in jail. Opposition leaders say the registrar would also have sweeping powers to de-register parties.
Parties would also be forbidden from functioning as ""pressure or activist groups"".
But the court rejected the opposition's plea on a technicality. ""This petition was not properly filed. It is therefore struck out with costs,"" said judge Benhajj Masoud.
The opposition leaders said if debate proceeds later this month, the amendments are likely to be rubber-stamped by a parliament dominated by the ruling party.
Lawmaker Zitto Kabwe, one of three opposition leaders who filed the lawsuit, said on Twitter he would keep fighting. 
""If the bill is eventually passed into law, we will oppose it again at the courts of law,"" he said. 
If the amendments pass, Tanzania would become ""a de facto one-party state"", said Kabwe's ACT-Wazalendo party.

The amendments were filed in November and expected to come up for debate after lawmakers return from recess on Jan. 29.

Support for the initiative surged last week after several new investigations were launched against foreign-born men on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors.
With elections coming up in April, sex crimes have turned into a heated topic of debate among politicians. Finnish government and parliamentary groups will meet this week to discuss how sex crimes can be prevented more effectively.
""We have to make clear that we have a zero tolerance on this,"" the initiative said. Any amendments to existing laws can only go ahead if parliament decides to take action.
The crimes began emerging over recent months in Oulu, the hometown of Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila where police suspect 16 foreign-born men of rape or other sexual abuses of adolescent girls aged between 10 and 15.
Helsinki police said on Sunday they had arrested three foreign-born men on similar charges. Two of them were released on Monday.
The initiative had 62,000 signatures by 1000 GMT on Monday, but due to the upcoming elections the handling of it will fall to the next parliament. 
""I created the initiative because of the hate speech... I thought someone has to do something,"" Saila Al-Jewari, who launched it in December after the first abuse cases in the northern town of Oulu made headlines, told Reuters.
""I am not racist, I am married to an Iraqi man. However, at the moment this media-fed hate incitement has led to even me, a native Finn, becoming a target of racist shouting and insulting.""
Al-Jewari acknowledged her proposal could well be stopped by human rights issues but said it was worth trying if even one new sex crime could be prevented.

""It really angers me that the politicians are riding this topic ahead of the elections. Does anyone of them think of victims? No. They only think of themselves. Why didn't they do something about the topic years ago?,"" Al-Jewari said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has proposed a China-European Union summit during Germany's 2020 EU presidency that would include national leaders of EU countries as well as officials from Brussels and Beijing, EU diplomats said.
The summit, which is likely to coincide with China's displacement of the United States as the EU's largest trade partner, would aim to counter what Berlin sees as Beijing's divide-and-rule approach to dealing with the bloc.
Projects like the Belt-and-Road debt-for-development initiative has made China an influential player in poorer eastern EU members like Hungary and Greece. 
But Germany and China are on the same side in the trade disputes that are dividing the West, with both manufacturing export powerhouses vulnerable to protectionist measures favored by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""Germany should make China an important theme of its EU council presidency in 2020,"" said Hubert Lienhard, head of the German parliamentary Asia-Pacific committee.
Germany takes over the rotating six-month presidency in the second half of 2020. 
Many have questioned whether Merkel's conservative-Social Democrat coalition will survive until then. She has already resigned the leadership of her Christian Democrat (CDU) party and said she will not run again for Chancellor. 

Assuming Britain leaves as scheduled in March, the EU will then have 27 member states whose leaders could attend the summit. Previous EU-China summits have tended to involve only the EU's own leaders and Chinese representatives.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.
She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News.
""Nazanin called me this morning to confirm from Evin prison that she has started this hunger strike this morning. It is initially a three-day hunger strike,"" her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said.

""Her ongoing detention is TOTALLY unacceptable and her treatment at the hands of Iranian authorities is a fundamental breach of human rights,"" Hunt wrote on Twitter.
""We all have Nazanin high in our thoughts as she starts her hunger strike today. It is a truly terrible indictment of Iran’s approach that she feels she needs to resort to such an ordeal. Iran must take action now.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities on Monday said they will immediately begin to download contents of a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) from a Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea near Jakarta more than two months ago, killing all 189 people on board.
The crash was the world's first of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, and the recovery of the aircraft's second black box from the Java Sea north of Jakarta on Monday may provide an account of the last actions of the doomed jet's pilots.
""We have our own laboratory and personnel to do it,"" Haryo Satmiko, deputy chief of the transportation safety committee, told Reuters.
Satmiko said it had in the past taken up to three months to download, analyze and transcribe the contents of recorders.
Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital, Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. 
A preliminary report by Indonesia's transport safety commission focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the response of a Boeing anti-stall system and a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a cause for the crash.
A group of relatives of victims urged the transportation safety committee to reveal ""everything that was recorded"" and to work independently.
Navy Lieutenant Colonel Agung Nugroho told Reuters a weak signal from the recorder was detected several days ago and it was found buried deep in soft mud on the sea floor in water about 30 meters (98 ft) deep.
""We don't know what damage there is but it has obvious scratches on it,"" Nugroho said. 
Pictures supplied by an official from the transportation agency showed chipped bright orange paint on the CVR memory unit, but no major dents.
Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at the safety committee, told reporters it should take no more than five days to download the data, but if there was a problem the CVR would be sent to the manufacturer.
""We hope it can be done as soon as possible because all the Boeing operators are waiting,"" said Utomo, adding that investigators hoped to complete the full report within a year of the crash.
With the recovery of the CVR, officials said there was no plan to continue searching for other parts of the wrecked plane, including an angle of attack sensor that was suspected to have been faulty.
The navy's Nugroho said human remains had been found near the location of the CVR, about 50 meters from where the crashed jet's other black box, the flight data recorder (FDR), was found three days after the crash.
Investigators brought in a navy ship last week after a 10-day, 38 billion rupiah ($2.70 million), effort funded by Lion Air failed to find the recorder. Bureaucratic wrangling and funding problems hampered the initial search.
The L3 Technologies Inc CVR was designed to send acoustic pings for 90 days after a crash in water, according to an online brochure from the manufacturer. 
That would mean that after Jan. 27, investigators could have faced a far bigger problem in finding the CVR buried along with much of the wreckage deep in mud on the sea floor..
Boeing said in a statement on Monday that it was taking ""every measure"" to fully support this investigation.
""As the investigation continues, Boeing is working closely with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as a technical advisor to support Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee,"" the planemaker said in a statement.

Since the crash, Lion Air has faced scrutiny over its maintenance and training standards, and relatives of victims have filed at least three lawsuits against Boeing.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Explainer: Where do the Kurds fit into Syria's war?,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The future of Kurdish-led swathes of northern and eastern Syria has been thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops who have helped secure the territory.
The region, roughly a quarter of Syria, is the largest chunk of the country still outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran.
Syrian Kurdish leaders fear Turkey, which sees them as a threat, will use a U.S. pullout as an opportunity to mount an assault into northern Syria. 
This has driven them to talk to Moscow and Damascus in the hope of agreeing a deal to protect the region and safeguarding their political gains.
In tweets on Monday, Trump threatened NATO ally Turkey with economic devastation if it attacks the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, drawing a sharp rebuke from Ankara.
(Syria control map: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RgCxxb) 
HOW DID THE KURDS EMERGE AS A FORCE?
The main Syrian Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), began to establish a foothold in the north early in the war as government forces withdrew to put down the anti-Assad uprising elsewhere. An affiliated militia, the People's Protection Units (YPG), secured the region.
Early in the conflict, their control was concentrated in three predominantly Kurdish regions home to roughly 2 million Kurds. Kurdish-led governing bodies were set up.
The area of YPG influence expanded as the fighters joined forces with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS), becoming the spearhead of a multi-ethnic militia alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
SDF influence widened to Manbij and Raqqa as IS was defeated in both. It has also reached deep into Deir al-Zor, where the SDF is still fighting IS. The SDF, which also includes Arab and other groups, says it has more than 70,000 fighters. 
Kurdish leaders say their aim is regional autonomy within a decentralized Syria, not independence.
WHY DOES TURKEY VIEW THEM AS A THREAT? 
The PYD is heavily influenced by the ideas of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights. Ocalan has been in jail since 1999 in Turkey. He is convicted of treason.
The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey says the PKK is indistinguishable from the PYD and YPG.
Turkey has a Kurdish minority equal to 15 to 20 percent of its population, mostly living in eastern and southeastern areas bordering Syria. Wary of separatistism, Turkey views the PYD's Syrian foothold as a security threat.
Syria's main Kurdish groups do not hide Ocalan's influence: they organized elections toward establishing a political system based on his ideas.
Turkey has already mounted two cross-border offensives in northern Syria as part of its efforts to counter the YPG. 
FOR KURDS, IS ASSAD A FRIEND OR FOE?
Syria's Baathist state systematically oppressed the Kurds before the war. Yet the YPG and Damascus have broadly stayed out of each other's way during the conflict, despite occasional clashes. They also have been seen to cooperate against shared foes, notably in and around Aleppo. 
The YPG has allowed the Syrian state to keep a foothold in some of its areas. The YPG commander told Reuters in 2017 it would have no problem with the Assad government if Kurdish rights are guaranteed in Syria. 
But Damascus has long opposed Kurdish autonomy demands and talks between the two sides last year went nowhere.
Kurdish-led authorities presented a roadmap for a deal with Assad at recent meetings in Russia and is awaiting a response, a senior Kurdish official told Reuters this month.
A Syrian government minister showed optimism last week over dialogue with Kurdish parties and said conditions were ripe for them to return to the state. 
WHAT WOULD AN ASSAD-KURD DEAL MEAN FOR THE WAR?
The territory held by Damascus and the Kurdish-led authorities accounts for most of Syria. A political settlement - if one could be reached, perhaps with Russian help - could go a long way to stitching the map back together. 
But it would not mark the end of the war.
Anti-Assad insurgents, though defeated across much of Syria by the government and its allies, still have a foothold in the northwest stretching from Idlib through Afrin to Jarablus. Turkey has troops on the ground in this area.
The rebels include Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army groups and jihadists.
Enmity runs deep between the YPG and these groups.
For the YPG, one priority is recovering Afrin from the rebels who seized it in a Turkey-backed offensive last year.

Assad also wants Turkey out as he vows to recover ""every inch"" of Syria.

The most notable move saw Jane Philpott move from the indigenous services portfolio to become the new president of the Treasury Board, who has overall control of public spending.
She replaced Scott Brison, who unexpectedly announced last Thursday he was quitting after 22 years in politics. 
Trudeau also named Judy Wilson-Raybould to the veterans affairs ministry. She had been justice minister since November 2015, when the Liberals took power.
Polls suggest that the Liberals - under pressure over their handling of the economy and stalled energy projects - could struggle to maintain their majority in an election this October. 

That would leave them in a weaker position, relying on support of other parties to advance their agenda and survive confidence votes.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's agriculture minister on Monday criticized supermodel Gisele Bundchen for saying Brazil is a deforester and said she will invite the supermodel to be an ambassador for the country's efforts to supply the world with food while preserving nature.
Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Twitter that Bundchen would receive the invitation soon, after striking out at her in a radio interview.
""Sorry, Gisele Bundchen, you should be our ambassador, to say that your country preserves, that your country is on the global vanguard of preservation, and don't come here saying bad things about Brazil without knowledge of the facts,"" Dias told Sao Paulo's Jovem Pan radio station earlier on Monday.
Press representatives for Bundchen did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Recruiting the supermodel as a spokeswoman for sustainability would be a major public relations coup for the government of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, which took power Jan. 1, by bringing onboard a critic of his predecessor's moves to loosen environmental protections.
Bundchen, who is married to U.S. football star Tom Brady, twice squared off with former President Michel Temer on social media over policies to shrink or eliminate protected areas of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Temer ultimately reversed himself in both cases, responding directly to her by Twitter in one instance after vetoing rules that would have reduced the size of the Jamanxim national forest in Brazil's Amazon rainforest.
Environmentalists have blasted the new Bolsonaro government, warning that it may broadly roll back environmental protections. 
Bolsonaro has said he wants to end an ""industry"" of environmental fines, which activists say is a major tool for ensuring rules are followed. He has also suggested Brazil could exit the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Dias' tweet followed on the radio interview in which she cited government statistics that Brazil has preserved roughly two-thirds of its native vegetation as evidence of the country's accomplishments in conservation.

The 41 members of the decision-making body within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) adopted a joint proposal by the United States, the Netherlands and Canada, member states said.
They agreed ""to add two families of highly toxic chemicals (incl. the agent used in Salisbury),"" Canada's ambassador to the agency, Sabine Nolke, said on Twitter. 
""Russia dissociated itself from consensus but did not break,"" she wrote.
Western allies ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War in response to the attack on former Russian secret service agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.
Britain says Russian GRU military intelligence agents poisoned the Skripals with Novichok. Moscow denies involvement.
Monday's OPCW decision was confidential and no other details were released.
It was the first such change to the organization's so-called scheduled chemicals list, which includes deadly toxins VX, sarin and mustard gas, since it was established under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.
The OPCW's 193 member countries have 90 days to lodge any objections to Monday's decision.

The OPCW, once a technical organization operating by consensus, broke along political lines over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, which Russia supports militarily.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Former Nissan boss Ghosn suffers 'harsh' treatment in jail: wife,"By Liana B. Baker and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - The wife of ousted Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn has urged New York-based Human Rights Watch to draw attention to his ""harsh treatment"" during detention in a Japanese jail, a letter seen by Reuters showed on Sunday.
Japanese authorities have charged Ghosn with under-reporting income and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008.
In a nine-page letter to Kanae Doi, the rights group's Japan director, Carole Ghosn asked it to ""shine a light on the harsh treatment of my husband and the human rights-related inequities inflicted upon him by the Japanese justice system"".
Ghosn was in charge of an alliance that included Nissan Motor (T:7201), Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), until his November arrest and removal as chairman of the automakers sent shockwaves through the industry.
The government has denied requests to end his detention, which has run since Nov. 19. Ghosn's lawyers have said it would probably take more than six months for his case to come to trial. (For Ghosn investigation timeline, click on)
Japan's Foreign Ministry said Ghosn's rights were assured under the country's laws.
""He is treated under the appropriate procedure, assuring fundamental human rights of individuals and undergoing strict judicial examination in according with relevant domestic laws of Japan,"" ministry spokesperson Natsuko Sakata said in an email.
Nissan said it was not in a position to comment on the workings of the judicial system, or any decision by the Tokyo prosecutors' office.
Officials at Human Rights Watch could not be reached for comment on the letter, but its Asia director, Brad Adams, said in an editorial on Thursday that Ghosn's case ""has shone a light"" on Japan's long-overlooked ""hostage"" justice system.
""Ghosn has not, and should not, receive preferential treatment,"" Adams wrote in the editorial, which appeared in the online edition of ""The Diplomat"". 
""But if Japan wants to live up to its reputation as one of the world's most advanced democracies, it needs to modernize its criminal justice system,"" he added.
""Regardless of the serious allegations against him, or the controversies surrounding his tenure at Nissan, no one should have their rights violated in this way while facing criminal charges.""
Nissan said last Friday it had filed a criminal complaint against Ghosn with Tokyo prosecutors related to the misuse of a ""significant amount of the company's funds"".
The former Nissan executive is being held in a 75-sq-foot (6.97-sq-m) unheated cell and being denied daily medication, his wife said in her letter. He has lost 7 kg (15 lb) since being detained and eats only rice and barley, she added.
Prosecutors in Japan often try to extract confessions from prisoners in detainment that could last months, Carole Ghosn said in the letter.
""For hours each day, the prosecutors interrogate him, browbeat him, lecture him and berate him, outside the presence of his attorneys, in an effort to extract a confession,"" she said. 
""No one should be forced to endure what my husband faces every day, particularly in a developed nation like Japan, the third largest economy in the world.""
Ghosn said he was ""wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations"" during a Tokyo court proceeding last week, his first public appearance since his November arrest, at which he seemed noticeably thinner.

The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) did not name 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who grabbed international attention after barricading herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room and appealing for help on Twitter to resist being sent back to her family, which denies any abuse.
But in a statement late on Sunday NSHR head Mufleh al-Qahtani accused unspecified countries and international organizations of pursuing political agendas and ""pushing (women) ultimately to be lost and maybe to fall into the arms of brokers and human traffickers"".
While NSHR says it is independent, the U.S. State Department describes it as ""government-funded"".
Riyadh’s human rights record has been in the spotlight since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate in October. There has also been growing international criticism of the Saudi-led coalition’s air strikes in Yemen that have caused heavy civilian casualties including children.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in Riyadh on Monday, said he spoke with Saudi leaders about Yemen, Khashoggi and other human rights issues.
NSHR ""was surprised by some countries' incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families and push them out of the country and seek to receive them under the pretext of granting them asylum,"" Qahtani said.
He did not name Canada or Australia, which also considered offering Qunun asylum, or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which granted her refugee status.
Qunun arrived in Toronto on Saturday, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word Canada, and a cap bearing the UNHCR logo. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland welcomed her at the airport, calling her ""a very brave new Canadian.""
Canada's move comes amid tension with Riyadh after Ottawa demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists last year, prompting Saudi Arabia to expel its ambassador to Canada, recall Saudis living there and freeze new trade.
The case has also drawn attention to Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, which requires women to have the permission of a male relative to travel, sometimes trapping them as prisoners of abusive families.
Qahtani said Saudi laws forbid mistreatment and allow women to report it, but international rights groups say in practice many Saudi women fear that going to the police would only further endanger their lives.

Lofven, who was prime minister from 2014-18 in a minority coalition with the Greens, agreed a deal last week with the Liberal and Centre parties for their support as prime minister, but the four parties still need support from the Left party.
""Our goal is that Stefan Lofven becomes prime minister, but we are not yet at a point where we can vote for him,"" Left leader Jonas Sjostedt told reporters. 
The deal with the Centre and Liberal party - the closest a fragmented parliament has come to breaking four months of political deadlock - specifically excluded the Left Party from any influence on policy during the next four years.
""We are in contact with Stefan Lofven and are going to use the next hours and days to find a solution,"" Sjostedt said.
September's election delivered a hung parliament and the center-left and center-right blocs have been at loggerheads on how to form a government without the support of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white-supremacist fringe and who hold the balance of power.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won her third straight term in an election last month marred by allegations of rigging, will ""soon"" meet opposition leaders who have so far boycotted parliament after rejecting the vote result.
""The prime minister said in our internal party meeting that she would invite the political parties and seek their cooperation to develop this country,"" Information Minister Hasan Mahmud told Reuters on Monday.
Hasina's ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seats contested amid accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 19 people. The government has repeatedly denied the charges.
All the eight opposition members, including six from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) whose chairwoman is in jail on what the party calls trumped-up corruption charges, have yet to be sworn in.
Abdul Awal, a BNP vice chairman, said his party would make a call on attending any meeting only after receiving a formal letter on Hasina's behalf.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 07:03AM ET</span>",Trump threatens Turkey with economic devastation if it attacks Syrian Kurd militia,"By Daren Butler and Lesley Wroughton
ISTANBUL/RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Turkey with economic devastation if it attacks a U.S.-allied Kurdish militia in Syria, drawing a sharp rebuke from Ankara on Monday and reviving fears of another downturn in ties between the NATO allies.
Relations between the United States and Turkey have long been strained by Washington's support for the Kurdish YPG, which Turkey views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that is waging a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.
Speaking in Riyadh, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he did not think the threat would change plans to withdraw troops from Syria. Asked what Trump meant by economic devastation, he said: ""You'll have to ask the president.""
""We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things, Pompeo said, adding he had not spoken with Ankara since Trump's comment.
Trump said on Sunday the United States was starting the military pull-out from Syria that he announced in December but that it would continue to hit Islamic State fighters there.
""Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone...Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Ankara is well aware of the cost of strained ties with the United States. A diplomatic crisis last year, when Trump imposed sanctions on two of President Tayyip Erdogan's ministers and raised tariffs on Turkish metal exports, helped push the Turkish lira to a record low in August.
The lira  slid as much as 1.6 percent to 5.5450 against the dollar and stood at 5.52 at 1122 GMT on Monday.
Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Trump should respect Washington's alliance with Ankara.
""Mr @realDonaldTrump It is a fatal mistake to equate Syrian Kurds with the PKK, which is on the US terrorists list, and its Syria branch PYD/YPG,"" spokesman Ibrahim Kalin wrote on Twitter.
""Terrorists can't be your partners & allies. Turkey expects the US to honor our strategic partnership and doesn't want it to be shadowed by terrorist propaganda,"" he said on Monday.
SAFE ZONE PROPOSAL
Trump gave no details about the safe zone proposal, but Pompeo said Washington wanted to provide security for those who have fought against Islamic State and to prevent any attack on Turkey from Syria.
""If we can get the space and the security arrangements right it would be a good thing for everyone in the region,"" Pompeo added said.
Trump announced last month he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, declaring they had succeeded in their mission to defeat the Islamic State group and were no longer needed.
However, U.S. officials have given mixed messages since then. The U.S.-led coalition said on Friday it had started the pullout but officials said later it involved only equipment, not troops.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara was not against the idea of a secure zone along the border, but said strategic partners and allies should not communicate over social media.
""Nothing can be achieved by threatening Turkey economically. We need to look at how we can coordinate together and how we can solve this,"" he said in a news conference with Luxembourg's foreign minister.
The Kurdish YPG has been a U.S. ally in the fight against the jihadists and it controls swaths of northern Syria. Erdogan has vowed to crush it in the wake of Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of the region.
Erdogan's communications director Fahrettin Altun said: ""Turkey will continue its anti-terror fight decisively"" and that it was a protector of the Kurds, not their enemy.
""Terror is terror and it must be eradicated at its source. This is exactly what Turkey is doing in Syria,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Turkey has swept YPG fighters from Syria's Afrin region and other areas west of the Euphrates river in military campaigns over the past two years. It is now threatening to strike east of the river, which it has avoided until now - partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.

An official from the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of militias led by the YPG, said on Sunday Islamic State militants were ""living their final moments"" in the last enclave they hold near the Iraqi border.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez' government aims to increase funding for Catalonia to 16.8 percent of total regional spending in 2019 from last year's 13.1 percent, according the draft budget.
The region, which has clashed with Madrid over its drive for independence from the rest of Spain, will receive just over 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from central government coffers as part of the increased share of transfers, plus another 200 million euros for infrastructure, the document showed.
The infrastructure funding would take Catalonia ahead of Andalusia, the most populous of Spain's 17 regions, as the single largest beneficiary of this year's budget.
Sanchez's government holds just 88 seats in the 350-seat parliament, making it reliant on votes from regional parties to approve any legislation.
The budget is the Socialist's largest legislative test since it came to power in June and failure to approve it, which would prompt an automatic roll over of last year's budget, could force Sanchez to call a snap general election. 
The government has promised to slash the budget deficit but boost social spending.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Judges at the International Criminal Court will rule on Tuesday over former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo's request to be acquitted and released after more than seven years in custody.
Gbagbo, 73, and Charles Blé Goudé, a close ally and former political youth leader, have been on trial since 2016 for war crimes allegedly committed under Gbagbo's leadership.
He faces four counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, persecution and other inhumane acts during post-electoral violence in Ivory Coast between December 2010 and April 2011, when Gbagbo refused to accept defeat by rival Alassane Ouattara.
Legal experts say that during the trial, which is roughly half over, prosecutors presented a lot of evidence crimes occurred, but few witnesses could link the ex-Ivory Coast leader directly.
""The prosecutor had a lot of insider witnesses, but if you look at their actual testimony it seems like many were afraid to implicate themselves,"" said Thijs Bouwknegt, an Amsterdam University researcher on genocide. ""A real link between the former president and the alleged crimes is hard to make."" 
An acquittal would be a major setback for the prosecution, stung by defeats in cases against Jean-Pierre Bemba, the Congolese ex-vice president released in June after his war crimes conviction was overturned, and former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who saw charges against him dropped in 2015.
""There is a lot of pressure on the ICC to make this case a success,"" said Bouwknegt.
A collapse of the case against Gbagbo, the first former head of state to stand trial at the ICC who has been in custody since November 2011, could bolster opponents questioning its effectiveness after just three war crimes convictions in 15 years.
If the court supports assertions by Gbagbo's defense team that prosecutors have failed to present evidence supporting the charges, judges could order his release.
Prosecutors argue the evidence shows Gbagbo and his inner circle hatched a plan to cling to power by whatever means necessary and that the trial should continue.
But the panel of three judges has been split over his ongoing custody, with one repeatedly insisting Gbagbo should be released provisionally while awaiting the outcome.

Provisional release can be granted if the judges are satisfied the suspect will return for trial and not obstruct or endanger the court's work. They will start reading their decision at 1000GMT in The Hague.

Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen did not appear at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) hearing. 
Nigeria's judiciary plays a key role in election matters and has helped resolve disputes in past votes. That means Onnoghen or his successor could help decide the victor if results of the Feb. 16 poll are disputed in court.
President Muhammadu Buhari, who was a military ruler in the early 1980s, is seeking a second term and is campaigning on his anti-corruption record.
The conduct tribunal, which tries asset declaration misdemeanors, said in a statement on Saturday that Onnoghen would face six separate charges, but did not give further details. Onnoghen could not be reached for comment.
Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave. 
The court agreed that the chief justice was not properly served with a court summons because papers were served to his personal assistant and not Onnoghen himself. 
""The case is adjourned to Tuesday 22nd January. Before then, the defendant would have been properly served,"" said Danladi Umar, chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal.
The charges stem from allegations made by Dennis Aghanya, who served as Buhari's media aide between 2009 and 2011 and worked with the president in his now defunct Congress for Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Change (CPC) party. 
The opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) said Buhari's ruling party was plotting to destabilize the judiciary ahead of elections by seeking to remove Onnoghen, which they say could cause a constitutional crisis. 

Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party said it was committed to addressing corruption allegations and that the opposition's claims were a ""baseless conspiracy theory"".

""With at least four murders on his conscience, (Battisti) lived very well between Paris and Rio de Janeiro for too many years, thanks also to the complicity of foreign governments,"" Salvini said in an interview with RAI state TV.
Salvini and Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede awaited Battisti's arrival at Rome's Ciampino airport. Bearded and wearing a brown jacket, Battisti smiled as police escorted him from the plane and across the tarmac.
After escaping in 1981, Battisti lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid extradition. Battisti remained in Brazil with the support of former left-wing president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
However, the far-right Bolsonaro, who took office this month, pledged to return Battisti to Italy. In December, a Brazilian Supreme Court judge ordered his arrest, but by then he had vanished again.
The former communist militant was tracked down in Bolivia, which he had entered illegally, and arrested on Saturday by an Interpol team in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 
Battisti, who became a successful crime novel writer, said last year that he feared he would be tortured and killed if he were sent back to Italy.

May said concern that a mutual desire to avoid triggering the backstop would be used as unfair leverage by the EU or by a future British government ""is entirely unwarranted"".

""I strongly believe the fear about the EU's intentions is unfounded too,"" May added in her letter to Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker.

In a joint reply to questions from the prime minister who is struggling to get the British parliament to back her withdrawal agreement, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU stood by its commitment to try and reach a post-Brexit trade deal by the end of next year in order to avoid using the unpopular ""backstop"".
While stressing that nothing in their letter could be seen as changing or being inconsistent with the draft treaty agreed with May last month, they said a commitment to speedy trade deal made by EU leaders had ""legal value"" which committed the Union ""in the most solemn manner"".
However, even if the target date were not met, they wrote, Britain would have the option to extend a status-quo transition period to avoid triggering the backstop, which is meant to avoid a hard customs border for Northern Ireland.

""If the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would only apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided,"" they said.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>",U.N. calls for 'rapid and unimpeded' aid access to Myanmar's Rakhine,"YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations called on the Myanmar government on Monday to allow “rapid and unimpeded” humanitarian access to Rakhine State, where fighting between government troops and autonomy-seeking rebels has displaced thousands of people.
The Rakhine State government issued a notice last week blocking non-governmental organizations and U.N. agencies from traveling to rural areas in five townships in the northern and central parts of the state affected by the conflict.
The International Committee of the Red Cross and U.N. World Food Programme were exempted from the ban, it said.
Myanmar's president urged the military to ""crush"" the rebels of the Arakan Army during a rare meeting with the commander-in-chief last week. The president, Win Myint, is a loyalist of the de facto government leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Fighting has forced about 5,000 people to flee from their homes and take shelter in monasteries and communal areas across the region since early January, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
""We are seriously concerned about new restrictions on humanitarian access which leave thousands of women, children and men in affected areas of Rakhine without access to adequate assistance and protection,” said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for U.N. office.
“We hope the government responds positively to our call for rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, and to ensure the protection of civilians in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law,” he said in an email.
The Rakhine State municipal affairs minister, whose name is also Win Myint, told Reuters the restrictions on humanitarian access were put in place for “security reasons”. 
“We don’t know how long it will last,” he said, “Access will be granted again if there is no security concern.”
Rakhine state has been roiled by successive rounds of violence in recent years. 
In 2017, the region was the site of an extensive military crackdown, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents, that prompted about 730,000 Rohingya to flee westwards into neighboring Bangladesh.
The Arakan Army, the group behind the recent fighting, is demanding greater autonomy from the central government for Rakhine State, where the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine people form the majority of the population.
Arakan Army fighters killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts in early January, state media reported. 
An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in the north of Rakhine State that also targeted civilians.

Myanmar governments have battled various autonomy-seeking ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called the confidence vote following the resignation of coalition partner Panos Kammenos and his Independent Greeks party on Sunday over a deal to end a decades-long dispute between Athens and Skopje over Macedonia's name.
Tsipras's Syriza party has 145 seats in the 300-seat parliament and the support of one independent lawmaker. 
The prime minister needs the support of at least five more deputies to win Wednesday's confidence vote.
On Monday, Tourism Minister Elena Kountoura and another lawmaker from the Independent Greeks party said they would support Tsipras during the vote. Kammenos expelled both of them from his parliamentary group.
Even if Tsipras prevails in the confidence vote, political uncertainty will increase as the government will have to rely on the backing of lawmakers outside his leftist Syriza party to push through legislative initiatives.

Tsipras hopes to bring the Macedonia name deal to parliament after the confidence vote, if he wins it, and to complete planned reforms before the next election. His current mandate ends in October.

Gibraltar is a British territory on Spain's southern coast and relies heavily on a free flow of labor and trade from the Spain, making it a major point of contention between the two countries. Spain has long claimed sovereignty of Gibraltar. 
""If there is no exit agreement, bilateral accords between Spain and the UK are still in place,"" Borrell said. 
The status of British citizens in Spain and Spanish citizens in Britain would not change substantially in the case of a hard Brexit, Borrell said.

(Reuters) - The deadly winter storm that clobbered a swath of the U.S. Midwest and East Coast over the weekend is blowing out to sea, but leaves as much as 13 inches of snow in Washington, D.C. and Virginia, and frigid arctic air parked over New England.
All Washington D.C. federal offices would be closed on Monday, but train and bus service in the metro D.C. area would resume after being shut down on Sunday, officials said.
""There's some digging out to do,"" Jim Hayes, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said early Monday.
""In Virginia, D.C. and Maryland, 6-to-12 inches of snow fell with some places getting 13 inches,"" he said.
The good news is that around noon on Monday the clouds should start clearing and temperatures will rise into the low 40's Fahrenheit, Hayes said.
The snowstorm is blamed for the deaths of at least eight people in road accidents across the U.S. Midwest and possibly also the death of an Illinois state police officer who was killed on Saturday during a traffic stop, officials said. 
Air traffic at Ronald Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport was returning to normal. Early on Monday, fewer than 400 flights were canceled in affected areas and about 1,600 were delayed, according the online flight tracking site Flightaware.
At the height of the storm, more than 1,600 flights were canceled in and out of U.S. airports on Sunday, the bulk of them at Washington's Reagan and Dulles, the website reported.
Winter storm warnings for millions of Americans in 10 states and Washington, D.C., were being lifted early Monday in a swath of the United States from Colorado to the East Coast, Hayes said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Efforts to negotiate a peace deal to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan, already beset by a disagreement over the agenda, on Monday faced a new hurdle over the venue for the talks.
Last week, Taliban leaders called off a fourth round of talks with U.S. officials in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar due to an ""agenda disagreement"", and refused to allow ""puppet"" Afghan government officials to join.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, is holding talks with regional powers and was expected to meet the Taliban in the coming days.
But diplomatic sources said differences over the venue had caused a delay. 
""Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), have made it clear that they will not participate in the peace talks if the meeting takes place in Qatar. But the Taliban insists on holding them in Qatar,"" said a Kabul-based diplomat whose country shares a border with Afghanistan. 
Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf nations severed ties with Qatar in 2017, alleging that Qatar funded militants and had close ties to Iran.
Qatar denied funding militants, but it restored diplomatic relations with Iran after the crisis with its neighbors. 
Washington has pushed the Gulf nations to end their dispute at a time when their support is crucial in talks with the Taliban.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who stopped in Doha on Sunday during a Middle East tour, said the rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors had gone on for too long.
The Taliban this month pushed to shift the venue from Saudi Arabia to Qatar in a bid to fend off Riyadh's bid to include the Afghan government in the talks.
""Differences between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have in fact damaged our peace process. The Saudis unnecessarily put pressure on us to announce a ceasefire which even the U.S. delegation didn't pursue,"" a Taliban leader, who declined to be named, told Reuters. 
The Saudi and UAE embassies in Kabul declined to comment. 
The tensions underscore what diplomats say is a lack of consensus among regional powers, whose support is crucial for long-term peace in Afghanistan.
""There is a whole load of posturing. They are not monolithic,"" a Western diplomat in Kabul said of Afghanistan's neighbors.
A senior Iranian diplomat said holding the peace talks in Saudi Arabia would be unacceptable to Tehran. 
""The U.S. officials want the venue to be in Saudi Arabia, but we are not comfortable,"" he said.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to confirm the date or location of the next meeting, though a senior Taliban source told Reuters it could take place on Tuesday.
The Taliban regards the United States as its main adversary in the Afghan war and views direct talks with Washington as a legitimate effort to seek the withdrawal of foreign troops before engaging with the Afghan government. 
""Even though there are a number of discussions, there's nothing particularly formal or structured or substantive to them,"" said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center. 
""It's very easy to get sidetracked, and it's easy for the Taliban to back out when it feels any one discussion doesn't serve its interests,"" he said.

RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince in Riyadh on Monday, but will cut short the rest of his Middle East trip to attend a family funeral, a State Department spokesman said.
Pompeo will return home after meetings in Oman instead of traveling on to Kuwait, deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said. U.S. officials said the death was in the family of his wife, who accompanied him on the trip and will return with him.
The top U.S. diplomat met separately with King Salman for 35 minutes and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for another 45 minutes, according to reporters traveling with him.
The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh tweeted that Pompeo and the crown prince had agreed on the need for a continued de-escalation in Yemen and adherence to agreements made last month at talks in Sweden to end a nearly four-year civil war between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-aligned Houthis.
Pompeo has said he would also discuss the investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, but no details of that discussion were immediately available.
A CIA assessment has blamed Prince Mohammed for ordering the killing of Khashoggi, a longtime royal insider who had become a critic of the crown prince, though Saudi officials deny the prince ordered the murder.
The killing has sparked the kingdom's worst political crisis in a generation, strained ties with Western allies including the United States, and focused attention on Prince Mohammed's domestic crackdown on dissent and the war in Yemen.

Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has governed the global financial hub since its independence over half a century ago, never seen its vote share drop below 60 percent and currently holds all but six of 89 elected seats in parliament.
Singapore is due to hold its next national ballot by early 2021, but analysts and political watchers say it could come as soon as this year.
""Let us never forget that we only have a toe-hold in parliament... The risk of a wipe-out with no elected opposition represented by the Worker's Party is a real one,"" Pritam Singh, the party's secretary general, said at an annual members' forum on Sunday.
Singh said the party's aim should be to contest and win a third of the seats in parliament but that this was a ""high bar"" given an ""uneven"" political playing field with the PAP.
A spokesman for the PAP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Singh added he hoped for a credible opposition to change the political landscape to one ""which is caring and confident about the future, not one that is framed by libel suit after libel suit against one's opponents, be they in politics or civil society.""
Three of the Worker's Party leadership, including Singh, are fighting civil lawsuits related to alleged financial mismanagement in town councils. The suits could result in bankruptcy which would see them lose their seats.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An undersea cable and pipe-laying ship, the Vanuatu-flagged MV Star Centurion, capsized in the Indonesian waters of the Singapore Straits after a collision with a tanker on Sunday, with no fatalities, authorities said on Monday.
The Singapore Straits are one of the world's busiest shipping zones with hundreds of container ships, oil and fuel tankers and dry bulk carriers daily traversing the waters that connect east Asia to Europe, India and Africa.
The collision happened just north of Bintan, an Indonesian island in the Riau Islands province that sits opposite the city-state of Singapore.
""It's already capsized,"" Samsul Nizar, the head of operations at the Indonesian coast guard base at Tanjung Uban on Bintan, told Reuters by telephone, ""but it hasn't sunk completely.""
Coast guard vessels were monitoring the ship, Nizar said, and all crew were in a safe condition and had been rescued by Singaporean authorities.
Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed the Centurion, a 13,000 deadweight tonne ship specializing in laying cables and pipes on the ocean floor, was anchored in the Horsburgh OPL zone, an area in which ships take on marine fuel, on the eastern edge of the Singapore Straits. Meanwhile, the Antea, a 40,000-deadweight-tonne oil product tanker, was steaming past it.
The Antea's registered owner is Pertamina. A spokesman for the company could not immediately be reached for comment on the matter.
It was not immediately clear who owns the Star Centurion, which also goes by the name of Lewek Centurian.

PRAYAGRAJ, India (Reuters) - Pilgrims from across the world are gathering in India for the Kumbh Mela, a heady mix of spirituality, politics and tourism that begins on Tuesday, garnering extra attention ahead of a general election in the Hindu-majority country this year.
During the eight-week festival at Prayagraj in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, authorities http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=187458 expect up to 150 million people, including a million foreign visitors, to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna, and a mythical third river, the Saraswati.
Devout Hindus believe that bathing in the waters of the Ganges absolves people of sins and bathing at the time of the Kumbh Mela, or the ""festival of the pot"", brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.
""Belief is what brings us here, to bathe in the waters despite the cold,"" said Ram Krishna Dwivedi, making his way back from the shore dressed in flowing white robes.
More than 80 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people are Hindus, many of them deeply religious despite an increasingly Westernized middle class.
On Tuesday, millions of pilgrims, led by naked, ash-smeared ascetics, some of whom live in caves, will plunge themselves into the cold waters during the first Shahi Snan, or Royal Bath, that begins at around 4 a.m. (2230 GMT).
With less than 24 hours until the festival starts, the last of the arriving ascetics paraded towards temporary ashrams, or monasteries, built of corrugated iron and canvas, many bedecked with fairy lights, on the east bank of the Ganges.
Pilgrims poured in to the site, which is closed to traffic around bathing days, carrying bundles on their heads, while vendors peddled balloons and candy floss, as security men stood guard, with priests and police seated side-by-side.
Authorities have set up temporary bridges, 600 mass kitchens and more than 100,000 portable toilets in a pop-up city at the confluence of the rivers, which is known as the sangam.
Those with cash can stay at luxury campsites on the river banks that offer ayurvedic spas and yoga, and cost up to 32,000 rupees ($455) a night. 
Most pilgrims make do with more modest lodgings, sleeping in big communal tents or out in the open.
""I don't know where I will stay yet, but you do not often get to meet these saints and sadhus,"" said Rajendra Singh, a retired soldier and now a security guard, who came by bus from the state capital, Lucknow, about 200 km (124 miles) away.
On Monday, a small fire broke out at one of the camps, though there was no report of any casualty, according to Reuters partner ANI. Authorities later warned pilgrims about open fires. 
POLITICAL PILGRIMAGE
This year's event comes at a critical time for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), expected to face a tough contest in a general election due by May.
It lost power in three key states in assembly elections in December, and will want to avoid a similar result during the general election in Uttar Pradesh, a state of 220 million where a good showing can often decide the outcome.
The state's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, is a firebrand Hindu priest from the BJP, who has championed policies that play to the party's core Hindu base.
This year Adityanath has transformed a smaller Ardh, or ""half"" Kumbh Mela, into a full version of the festival.
He has also lobbied to build a Hindu temple on the site of a former mosque, and renamed several cities with Hindu names - including Prayagraj, which was Allahabad until October.
Modi and his rival, opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, are both expected to attend the festival before it wraps up in March.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday chastised China over the detention of two Canadians following the arrest of a senior Chinese executive at the request of the United States.
Trudeau also accused China of ""not respecting the principles of diplomatic immunity"" in one of the cases.
Asked about Trudeau's comments, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that the ""relevant Canadian person"" should ""earnestly study"" the Vienna Convention before speaking, so as to ""not become a laughing stock"".
""No matter how you look at it, Michael Kovrig does not have diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention,"" she said.
Kovrig is not now serving as a diplomat and had entered China on his most recent trip on a regular passport and business visa, she said.
Kovrig was one of two Canadians detained in China days after the Dec. 1 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], in Vancouver, at the request of the United States.
The other Canadian held in China is businessman Michael Spavor.
China has not directly linked its arrest of the two Canadians with Meng's arrest in Canada. It says the two men are being investigated in accordance with Chinese law.
But Beijing-based Western diplomats have called the detentions a clear reprisal for Meng's arrest and have said the two are ""political hostages"" being used as leverage by Beijing.
Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, has become the focus of intense scrutiny by Western countries concerned about its relationship with the Chinese government.
The United States has suggested the company's equipment could be used by Chinese authorities for spying.
U.S. authorities allege Meng deceived international banks into clearing transactions with Iran by claiming that two companies that did business with Iran were independent of Huawei.
However, corporate filings and other documents found by Reuters in Iran and Syria show that Huawei is closely linked to both firms.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2019 12:17AM ET</span>","From Tibet to the 'Nine Dragons', Vietnam's Mekong Delta is losing sand","By Mai Nguyen and James Pearson
MO CAY, Vietnam (Reuters) - In the dead of night, the entire front half of shopkeeper Ta Thi Kim Anh's house collapsed. Perched on the sandy banks of the Mekong River, it took just a few minutes for one half of everything she owned to plunge into its murky depths.
""Our kitchen, our laundry room, our two bedrooms, all gone,"" said Kim Anh, speaking amongst the twisted metal and rubble of her house, from which she still sells eggs, soap and instant noodles to villagers in Ben Tre, a province in Vietnam's Mekong Delta region.
""We'd be better off living in a cave instead,"" said Kim Anh, who has used coconut husks and old tires to reinforce the riverbank under her home.
Upstream damming and extensive mining of the Mekong's riverbed for sand is causing the land between the sprawling network of rivers and channels near the mouth of one of the world's great rivers to sink at a pace of around 2 cm (0.75 inches) a year, experts and officials said.
The 4,350 km (2,700-mile) river, known as the Lancang in its upper reaches, flows from China's Tibetan Plateau along the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, through Cambodia and finally Vietnam, where it forms the delta known in Vietnam as the ""Nine Dragons"".
Reuters visited three provinces straddling different branches of the delta, where it has supported farming and fishing communities for millennia.
Across the region, local authorities are struggling with a rapid pace of erosion that is destroying homes and threatening livelihoods in the Southeast Asian country's largest rice-growing region.
A key cause is the years of upstream damming in Cambodia, Laos and China that has removed crucial sediment, local officials and experts said.
That sediment, vital for checking the mighty Mekong's currents, has also been lost due to an insatiable demand for sand - a key ingredient in concrete and other construction materials in fast-developing Vietnam - that has created a market both at home and abroad for unregulated mining.
""It's not a problem of the lack of water, it's the lack of sediment,"" said Duong Van Ni, an expert on the Mekong River at the College of Natural Resources Management of Can Tho University, the largest city in the Mekong Delta region.
""SAND NEVER REACHES US""
At this time of year the waters of the Mekong used to flow into Vietnam as a milky-brown crawl, locals and officials said. 
Now, the river runs clear. And without fresh sediment from upstream, the deeper riverbed creates stronger currents, which in turn eat away at the banks of the Mekong, where those who rely on the river for their livelihoods have their homes.
The problems began when China built its first hydropower plants in the Upper Mekong Basin, said Ni at Can Tho University. That left Laos, Cambodia and Thailand as the main source of sediment for the Mekong in Vietnam, he said.
Sand mining in Cambodia boomed over the last 10 years, fueled in part by demand from wealthy but cramped Singapore, where it is used to reclaim land along its coast, and culminating in a government ban of all Cambodian sand exports in 2017 under pressure from environmental groups.
Hydroelectric projects have continued, however. Earlier this month, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen opened a $816 million hydroelectric dam in Stung Treng province, near the border with Laos, built by companies from China, Cambodia and Vietnam.
The new dam is the southeast Asian country's biggest hydroelectric project to date and will have a catastrophic impact on fisheries and biodiversity in the Mekong river, environmental groups have said. Hun Sen has dismissed criticism of the project, which he says benefits Cambodia and its people.
""Since China built hydropower plants, new sand almost never reaches us,"" said Ni. ""If we use up the sand we have here, there will be no more"".
China's Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters' questions that it ""pays great attention to the concerns and needs of downstream countries on the Mekong"", adding that its regulation of water flows from hydro dams ""has already become an important instrument in preventing floods and droughts"".
Singapore's Ministry of National Development said in a statement emailed to Reuters the city state imports sand on a commercial basis from various countries. ""We have stringent controls to ensure that suppliers obtain sand in accordance with the source country's laws and regulations,"" it said.
SLINGSHOTS AND SAND THIEVES
Regional officials in southwest China's Yunnan province have defended the building of dams on the Mekong there as ""fully legally compliant"".
Downstream, however, the problem is made worse by thieves who illegally mine for sand, usually at night.
""The unlicensed sand miners are very quick and devious,"" Nguyen Quang Thuong, vice head of Ben Tre province's agriculture department, told Reuters in a recent interview. 
""They escape very fast, so having groups of local people helping out the authorities is very helpful.""
One such group in Ben Tre, some of whom are as old as 67, have been using homemade weapons such as slingshots and rudimentary catapults to drive the sand thieves away.
""We patrol 24/7, and in the first few months we managed to get rid of 90 percent of the thieves,"" said Nam Lai, one of the group. ""Since 2018, none of them dare to go near our shore"".
Still, activists and environmental groups worry that on the Mekong, which runs through six countries with competing needs to exploit the river's hydroelectric potential, the damage has already been done.
Pianporn Deetes, at the International Rivers campaign group, who has worked on the Mekong for two decades, said there was a lack of political will among the countries that share the river to acknowledge the cross-border impact of such projects.

""Without the recognition of the existing problems, I don't think there is any hope,"" she said.

The EU in November began a formal procedure to strip Cambodia of its Everything but Arms (EBA) status, after Hun Sen returned to power in a July general election in which his party won all of the seats after a crackdown on the opposition.
""If you want the opposition dead, just cut it,"" Hun Sen said in a speech at the inauguration of a ring road around the capital, Phnom Penh, addressing the European Union and referring to Cambodia's EBA status.
""If you want the opposition alive, don't do it and come and hold talks together,"" he said.
EBA is an initiative aimed at helping poorer countries. It can be withdrawn in the case of serious violations of human rights conventions.
The EU threatened to withdraw the trade preferences because of a crackdown on the opposition ahead of the July election, which the EU condemned as not being credible.
Hun Sen, 66, who also marked 34th year of his premiership on Monday, said that he would not forgive those who had appealed to Western countries to cut aid to press his government, and said critics should get ready to flee abroad.
""People are prepared to flee, be prepared,"" Hun Sen said.
""I won't forgive them.""
Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and banned 118 party members in 2017 at the request of the government after accusations that the party was plotting to take power with the help of the United States.
The party and the United States rejected any such plot.
CNRP leader Kem Sokha was released from prison in September after spending more than a year in jail on treason charges but remains under house arrest in Phnom Penh.
He denies any wrongdoing. Other senior party members have left the country, in fear of arrest.
EU countries took about 40 percent of Cambodia's exports in 2016, the bulk from the garment sector that employs about 700,000 people.

EU Ambassador George Edgar and the CNRP did not immediately responded to requests for comments on Monday.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will launch a renewed search effort as early as Tuesday to find the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, the head of its accident investigation agency said.
""If the weather is good, the ship will start to depart today,"" National Transporation Safety Commission (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The crash, the world's first of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board.
Investigators last week said they planned to use a navy ship for a fresh search for the crashed jet's second ""black box"" after a 10-day effort funded by Lion Air failed to find the cockpit voice recorder (CVR).
A KNKT source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the team will have seven days using the ship KRI Spica to find the CVR, which could hold vital clues giving investigators insight into the actions of the doomed jet's pilots.
Tjahjono declined to comment on whether there was a time limit on the search.
Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. 
The other black box, the flight data recorder, was recovered three days after the crash.

A preliminary report by KNKT focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash.

The source said that the Pentagon drew up options in response to the request, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and which originated from the White House National Security Council led by John Bolton.
Citing current and former U.S. officials. The newspaper reported that the request sparked deep concern among Pentagon and State Department officials. 
The Wall Street Journal also reported that it was not clear whether the options were provided to the White House, whether President Donald Trump knew of the request or whether serious plans for a U.S. strike against Iran took shape at that time.
The decision was prompted by three mortars being fired into a diplomatic quarter in Baghdad in September, the newspaper said. The shells landed in an open lot and no one was hurt. Two days later, unidentified militants fired three rockets that hit close to the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Basra but caused no serious damage.
The State Department did not comment on the report. The Pentagon said it provides the president options for a variety of threats. 

NSC spokesman Garrett Marquis, said the NSC does the same and it will continue to consider ""the full range of options"" after the attacks.

QAMISHLI, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State militants are ""living their final moments"" in the last enclave they hold near the Iraqi border, where U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are attacking them, an SDF official said on Sunday.
A defeat of the jihadists in the enclave would wipe out Islamic State's territorial foothold on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River.
A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said the SDF were making ""great progress ... but the fight continues"".
The SDF, a coalition of militias led by the Kurdish YPG, have driven Islamic State from a swathe of northern and eastern Syria with the help of the U.S.-led coalition over the last four years.
Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, said its fighters had stepped up attacks in the last two days and taken control of the area between the Islamic State enclave and the Iraqi border, cutting an escape route.
""They are living their final moments and realize that this battle is the battle to eliminate them,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month announced he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, declaring they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed.
Since then, U.S. officials have given mixed messages. On Friday, the U.S.-led coalition said it had started the pullout, but officials later said it involved only equipment, not troops.
Colonel Sean Ryan, the coalition spokesman, said: ""The SDF is making great progress and continues to liberate more territory once held by ISIS (Islamic State), but the fight continues.
""The lasting defeat of ISIS is still the mission and they still present a very real threat to the long-term stability in this region, so it is not over yet.""
The U.S. decision has injected new uncertainty into the eight-year-old Syrian war and spurred a flurry of contacts over how the security vacuum will be filled in the swathe of northern and eastern Syria where the U.S. forces are now stationed.
While Turkey aims to pursue the Kurdish forces allied with the United States, the Russia- and Iran-backed Syrian government sees a chance to recover extensive territory.
On Sunday, Trump said Turkey would suffer economically if it attacked the Kurds, but did not say how. He also said he did not want the Kurds to provoke Ankara.
""Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone ... Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey.""
Russia, Iran and Syria had been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying Islamic State in Syria, Trump said.
""We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!"" he tweeted. It was not immediately clear what he meant by a 20-mile safe zone.
U.S. national security adviser John Bolton suggested last week that protection for Washington's Kurdish allies would be a precondition of the U.S. withdrawal. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called those comments ""a serious mistake"".

Islamic State still holds territory on the western bank of the Euphrates, between areas controlled by the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian-backed allies.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Britain pledges legislation in 2019 to combat deadly air pollution,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Monday pledged to fight air pollution and introduce new legislation this year on air quality to save lives and billions of pounds for the economy.
The government said Britain would become the first major economy to adopt air quality goals based on World Health Organization recommendations regarding people's exposure to particulate matter.
""Air pollution continues to shorten lives, harm our children and reduce quality of life. We must take strong, urgent action,"" environment minister Michael Gove said in a statement.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it aimed to reduce the costs of air pollution to society by 1.7 billion pounds every year by 2020, increasing to 5.3 billion pounds every year from 2030.
Last year, the government published plans to reduce emissions from cars and planes. In addition to cars, diesel-only trains will also be phased out by 2040.
The strategy, which also looks to tackle home, farming and industrial pollutants, commits Britain to halving the number of people who live in areas breaching WHO guidelines on pollution as poor air quality in British cities comes under scrutiny.
On Friday, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave consent for a new inquest to be opened into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old asthma sufferer who died in 2013, after her family argued that the initial inquest ignored the role air pollution might have played in her death.
A petition to Cox by the family said there was evidence Kissi-Debrah's hospital visits were linked to illegal levels on air pollution near her home in South London. Cox said that the evidence meant the family could apply for a new inquest at the High Court.
She would be the first person in Britain to have her death legally linked to air pollution as charities and pressure groups bid to raise awareness of the impact poor air quality has on health.
""Thousands of lives are lost every year in the UK because the air we breathe contains dangerous particles,"" said Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, adding the strategy need matching with legislative action.

""We urgently need these guidelines adopted into national law, to accelerate coordinated, bold and ambitious action that will protect people's heart and circulatory health wherever they live in the UK.""

Fighting corruption has been a major priority during the administration of President Xi Jinping. He said last month that, while the Chinese Communist Party had won an ""overwhelming victory"" against graft, deep-seated corruption still needed to be weeded out.
The Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Sunday this year's campaign would focus on areas related to ""the people's livelihood"" and would ""let the masses have a greater sense of achievement, greater happiness and greater security"".
This year's efforts would also focus on corruption and other criminal behavior among grassroots governments, and tackle instances of bribery, abuse of power, negligence and malpractice in the financial sector. 
It said it would also aim to prevent ""interest groups"" from corrupting top officials.
As well as tackling direct corruption, China would also seek to eliminate bureaucratic tendencies in government and ""rectify"" those officials guilty of behaving in a ""perfunctory"" manner when carrying out tasks, it said.
China would also aim to participate more in international anti-corruption governance in order to pursue suspects who have fled abroad. China brought 441 ""corrupt fugitives"" back to the country from August to December last year, the official China Daily said on Monday.
""These efforts aim to finally make officials not dare to, unable to and have no desire to commit any illegal act,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.

Morrison heads to Vanuatu on Wednesday, in the first visit by an Australian prime minister to the Pacific island nation in three decades. He then will go to Fiji, returning on Friday, a spokesman said.
""This is part of our Pacific step-up. It is part of a refocus of our international efforts on our own region, in our own backyard, and making sure we can have the biggest possible difference,"" Morrison said on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV.
The trip follows Chinese President Xi Jinping's meeting in November with eight Pacific Island leaders before the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea.
China's efforts to woo Pacific island nations have been watched warily by the countries that have traditionally wielded power in the region, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
Australia announced in November it would offer Pacific countries up to $2 billion in grants and cheap loans for telecommunications, energy, transport and water projects, looking to counter China's influence.
At the same time, Australia said it would beef up defense and security ties with Pacific islands through new joint exercises and training.
Canberra promised to bolster Vanuatu's cyber security capability in June as it agreed to begin negotiating a security treaty. 
China has spent $1.32 billion on concessional loans and gifts since 2011 to become the second-largest donor after Australia in the Pacific region, raising concern in the West that several tiny nations could end up in debt to Beijing. 
Morrison is moving into campaign mode ahead of an election expected in May, following the release of what is expected to be a surplus budget in April.
One issue on the agenda in Fiji is the Australian government's decision to revoke the citizenship of a man accused of being an Islamic State recruiter, believing he was a dual citizen with Fiji as his father was Fijian. 
Fiji has since said that Neil Prakash, now jailed in Turkey, does not have Fijian citizenship, meaning Australia has effectively left him stateless.

CARABALLEDA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido led a rally on Sunday after being briefly detained by intelligence agents, days after saying he would be willing to replace the increasingly isolated President Nicolas Maduro.
Guaido's comments on Friday spurred some opposition sympathizers to conclude that he had declared himself interim president, and led several government officials to say he should be arrested for treason.
Intelligence agents on Sunday pulled him from his car on the way from the capital, Caracas, to the coastal town of Caraballeda, his wife and opposition legislators said.
He was released shortly thereafter, they said.
""I want to send a message to Miraflores - the game has changed,"" said Guaido, the head of the opposition-run congress, referring to the presidential palace, from a stage surrounded by cheering opposition sympathizers. 
""Here we are! We are not afraid!""
Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez told state television the detention was an ""irregular procedure"" by rogue agents who wanted to help the opposition create a ""media show,"" adding that the agents would face disciplinary action.
Guaido called Rodriguez's comments a sign that the government had lost control of its own security forces.
Asked whether he should be considered interim president, Guaido responded: ""That has been clarified several times."" 
The U.S. State Department on Saturday had called on Venezuelan security forces to respect the ""safety and welfare"" of Guaido and other legislators, calling for an ""orderly transition to a new government.""
Maduro was sworn in to a second term on Thursday, defying critics in the United States and Latin America who called him an illegitimate usurper of a nation where economic chaos has wrought a humanitarian crisis.
A regional bloc, known as the Lima Group, that opposes the continuation of Maduro's leadership in Venezuela, said it condemned the ""arbitrary detention"" of Guaido. It added it would reject any pressure on congress or its members. 
The once-booming OPEC nation's economy has collapsed following the fall of oil prices in 2014. Inflation is close to 2 million percent and some 10 percent of the population has emigrated since 2015 in search of better living conditions.

Maduro says the country is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by his political adversaries with the help of Washington. He insists the 2018 vote was legitimate and that the opposition boycotted it because it knew it would lose.

PARIS (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen launched her campaign for the May 26 European Parliament election on Sunday with an appeal to the broad ""yellow vest"" protest movement that has rattled the government.
Le Pen urged the tens of thousands of protesters who have staged weekly protests against President Emmanuel Macron since November to make the EU vote a referendum on his policies. 
""In the context of the healthy popular revolt of the yellow vests, this election offers a chance to end this crisis born of the intransigence and contempt ... of an incompetent president whose behavior is disturbing,"" Le Pen told an election rally for her National Rally (""Rassemblement National"") party. 
Born from a grassroots protest against high fuel prices, the yellow vests have become a broad and sometimes violent movement demanding more social justice for low-skilled workers left behind by globalisation, deregulation and EU integration. 
Although independent of parties and unions, the movement shares many of the RN's demands: proportional representation in parliament, direct democracy through Swiss-style referendums, less European integration and - above all - Macron's resignation.
""If Macron does not have the wisdom to go back to the people by dissolving parliament, then let the political arbitrage come from European elections,"" said Le Pen, as her supporters repeatedly shouted ""Macron, demission!"" (""Macron, resignation!"").
POLITICAL MAP REDRAWN
Both Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon have publicly sympathized with the yellow vests - named after the high-visibility jackets they wear - and asked for their support.
Le Pen hopes the EU vote will advance a redrawing of France's political map. The process began with the first round of the 2017 presidential election, when Macron's upstart centrist movement and her own National Front, since renamed, eliminated the traditional big parties - the conservative Les Republicains and the Socialists. 
""The battle is now between nationalists and globalists,"" she said. 
Since the start of the yellow vest protests, Le Pen's RN has gained in the polls. A mid-December Ifop poll gave it 24 percent support against 18 percent for Macron's LREM. 
The conservatives had 11 percent, Melenchon's La France Insoumise (""France Unbowed"") 9 percent, the movement of former Le Pen ally Nicolas Dupont-Aignan 8 percent and the Socialists just 4.5 percent. 
Le Pen herself is not running in the European election as she wants to remain in the French parliament, and on Sunday presented 23-year-old Jordan Bardella as the NR's leading candidate.
""In Italy and Austria, our allies are governing,"" Bardella said. ""A better tomorrow is within our grasp.""
Macron himself will launch three months of national debate this week to air yellow-vest grievances in the hope of appeasing the movement.
An RN supporter at Sunday's rally, Sebastien Lefevre, told Reuters he fully supports the yellow vests as does his party.

""And from what I understand from the polls, most of the yellow vests would vote for us,"" he said.

RABAT (Reuters) - Hundreds of people gathered in Morocco's capital Rabat late on Saturday to mark the start of the Amazigh new year with a sit-in calling on the state to make the celebration a national holiday.
Home to North Africa's biggest Amazigh, or Berber, population, Morocco long marginalised its language and culture in favour of Arabic and French, giving rise to an Amazigh identity movement which has steadily gained influence.
Demands of the Amazigh movement featured prominently in 2011 protests which led to Morocco adopting a constitution and the Moroccan monarch to devolve some of his power to an elected government.
""This day is an occasion to highlight our strong attachment to the land and pay tribute to those who defended our freedom,"" Adil Adasko, an Amazigh civil society leader, told the rally.
The first day of the year in the Amazigh calendar, rooted in seasons and agriculture, marks the anniversary of the ascent of Libyan King Sheshong to the throne of Egypt, according to historians. The new year which begins on Sunday is year 2969. 
Morocco recognised Amazigh as an official language only with the new constitution in 2011. Eight years on, parliament has yet to enact the legislation required to establish its use in education and public life, and activists accuse the government of dragging its feet.
Last week, 143 out of a total of 395 members of parliament submitted a motion to Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani asking for the Amazigh new year to be recognised as a national day, a step already taken by neighbouring Algeria.
Government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Othmani was studying the issue.

The Amazigh movement has also played a role in protests in some of Morocco's marginalised areas, including demonstrations over economic and social grievances in the Rif region in 2016 and last year in the Souss region.

DOHA/RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that a rift between Qatar and its Gulf Arab neighbors had gone on for too long and was threatening regional unity needed to counter Iran.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their regional foe Shi'ite Muslim Iran -- something Doha denies. 
The United States, an ally of the six-nation Sunni Muslim GCC, sees the rift as a threat to efforts to contain Iran and has pushed for a united Gulf front.
""When we have a common challenge, disputes between countries with shared objectives are never helpful,"" Pompeo, who is on a tour of the Middle East, told a news conference in the Qatari capital Doha. 
""They never permit you to have as robust a response to common adversaries or common challenges as you might,"" he added.
Gas-rich Qatar says the boycott is aimed at undermining its sovereignty and has started charting a course away from its Gulf neighbors, including forging new trade partnerships, strengthening its ties with Turkey and quitting OPEC. Those moves have deepened expectations that the row will not be resolved quickly.
""We're hoping that the unity of GCC will increase in the days and weeks and months ahead,"" Pompeo said, adding that Gulf unity was essential for a planned Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) that would also include Jordan and Egypt.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have repeatedly said the dispute is not a top priority and assured Washington it will not affect defense cooperation.
Pompeo later told reporters that he had also raised the rift with officials in Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. ""It's ... not at all clear that the rift is any closer to being resolved today than it was yesterday and I regret that,"" he said. 
KHASHOGGI MURDER
Later, Pompeo traveled to the Saudi capital Riyadh, where he plans to press for ""full and complete"" accountability on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S.-based Washington Post journalist from Saudi Arabia. 
""We will continue to talk about that and make sure we have all the facts so that they are held accountable certainly by the Saudis but by the U.S. as well where appropriate,"" Pompeo told the news conference in Doha.
Arriving in Riyadh, Pompeo was greeted at the airport by Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, and U.S. Charge D'Affaires Christopher Henzel.
He is expected to meet with the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler known in the West as MbS, to discuss the investigation into Khashoggi's death. 
A CIA assessment has blamed Prince Mohammed for ordering the killing of Khashoggi, a long-time royal insider who had become a critic of the crown prince, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Top Turkish officials have also tied the death of the journalist, whose body was dismembered and removed from the building to a location still publicly unknown, to the highest levels of Saudi leadership.
Saudi officials have denied accusations that the prince ordered the murder, which has left the kingdom facing its worst political crisis in generations, strained ties with Western allies and focused attention on the prince's domestic crackdown on dissent and the war in Yemen.
The sister of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of several Saudi women's rights activists detained in the kingdom since last summer and accused of treason, pressed Pompeo to raise the issue with officials in Riyadh.
In a New York Times op-ed, Alia al-Hathloul described how her sister was allegedly tortured and threatened while in detention. ""Even today, I am torn about writing about Loujain, scared that speaking about her ordeal might harm her,"" she wrote.

The Saudi authorities have denied such torture charges.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",Sex abuse cases color immigration debate before Finnish election,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - The parliamentary heads of two of Finland's largest parties have called for action after investigations against 19 foreign-born men on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors.
The issue has boosted the support of the anti-immigration, populist The Finns Party, whose popularity jumped two points to over 10 percent in the latest poll published by the national broadcaster YLE ahead of a parliamentary election on April 14.
Police have said there were foreign-born men among the 16 investigated for rape or other sexual abuses of adolescent girls in the town of Oulu over the last two months. On Sunday, police in Helsinki said they had arrested three foreign-born men on similar charges.
Antti Kaikkonen, parliamentary head of the coalition-leading Centre Party, called for a meeting of all the parliamentary party heads, tweeting: ""Everyone who comes to Finland has to follow the local laws.""
Antti Lindtman, parliamentary head of the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, said: ""The question is, are there measures we could take now - even during this term - to prevent cowardly crimes like these? Yes, there are.""
Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted that the government would discuss the ""inhuman and reprehensible events"" twice next week.
The topic is shocking for many in Finland, which sees itself as one of the safest and happiest countries on earth.
A citizens' initiative to withdraw asylum from people convicted of a sex crime has doubled its signatures in just a few days and reached 25,000 on Sunday - half the total needed to force parliament to consider the issue.
The country of 5.5 million people has historically had very few immigrants. But the issue has become more fraught since the European refugee crisis of 2015, which caused the number of asylum seekers to almost quadruple to 28,208 in 2016. 
Statistics Finland says around 1,200 cases of sexual abuse of minors are reported to the police each year, and that foreigners were involved in 18 percent of the cases that came to trial last year. 
Lindtman proposed toughening the penalties for sex crimes against minors and withdrawing asylum from people convicted of serious violent or sexual crimes.

PARIS (Reuters) - French media and reporters' organizations on Sunday denounced attacks on journalists by ""yellow vest"" anti-government protesters and called for better protection after a series of incidents this weekend. 
Paris police fired water cannon and tear gas to push back demonstrators from around the Arc de Triomphe monument on Saturday, in the ninth straight weekend of protests against French President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms.
Journalists covering the protests are increasingly becoming a target for the demonstrators.
In the western city of Rouen, LCI television reporters were attacked by a group of protesters. One of the security agents working with the TV crew was beaten while he was on the ground and had his nose broken, with footage of the incident widely shared on social media. 
In Paris, an LCI reporter was pushed to the ground as demonstrators tried to take away her camera, the station said, adding that it will take legal action against the attackers.
Several other stations, including BFM TV and franceinfo, on Sunday showed images of reporters being hassled or pushed around during Saturday's ""yellow vest"" marches. 
Reporters without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire called on authorities to take action.
""This is anti-democratic blackmail from people who consider they can beat up journalists if they disagree with the way events are covered,"" he said on France Info radio. 
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on his Twitter feed that anyone attacking reporters will be brought to justice. 
""In our democracy, the press is free ... attacking journalists is attacking the right to inform,"" he said. 
France has been rocked by yellow vest protests against Macron's reforms since the middle of November in a movement that has no designated leaders and is not linked to political parties or unions.
Started as a protest against high fuel prices, the movement has morphed into a fight for social justice and more direct democracy. Several demonstrations have degenerated into violent clashes with police. 

Over the coming week, Macron will launch three months of national debate to air yellow-vest grievances in the hope of appeasing the movement, which has undermined his authority and upended his reform drive. https://reut.rs/2SQ3KUX

In Khartoum North, across the Blue Nile from the center of the capital, security forces chased groups of protesters down side streets and fired tear gas to disperse demonstrations in several areas, a Reuters witness said.
They also confronted protesters with tear gas in Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira state, southeast of the capital, and for the first time in Nyala, the main city in South Darfur, witnesses said.
Protests triggered by an economic crisis have rippled across Sudan since Dec. 19 in the most sustained challenge yet to Bashir's close to 30-year rule. 
Security forces have used live ammunition and tear gas to break up demonstrations, as well as arresting protesters and opposition figures. 
A government fact-finding committee has recorded 24 deaths and Amnesty International has said that at least 40 have died.
Officials have blamed the protests on ""infiltrators"" and said they are working to address economic problems.
In Khartoum North on Sunday hundreds of people braved a heavy security presence to protest despite police and other security personnel trying to clear the area ahead of the rally.
Some carried national flags and were chanting ""freedom, freedom"" and ""with our soul, with our blood, we sacrifice ourselves for you Sudan"". 
""We will continue to demonstrate until Bashir falls ... the country needs change,"" one 36-year-old protester told Reuters.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",Iran says it is taking initial steps to design reactor fuel,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is taking preliminary steps to design uranium fuel with a purity of 20 percent for reactors instead of having to copy foreign designs, Iran's nuclear chief said on Sunday.
Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers caps the level to which it is able to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent purity, well below the 20 percent it was reaching before the deal, and the roughly 90 percent that is weapons-grade.
Iran is, however, allowed to produce nuclear fuel under strict conditions that need to be approved by a working group set up by the signatories to the deal. Those conditions include ensuring that the fuel cannot be converted to uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges that enrich uranium.
""We have made such progress in nuclear science and industry that, instead of reverse-engineering and the use of designs by others, we can design new fuel ourselves,” state broadcaster IRIB quoted Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, as saying. 
""Initial measures have been started for the design of modern 20 percent fuel and we're on the verge of (achieving) it. This product is different from the previous 20 percent fuel, and we can supply fuel to any reactor that is built like the Tehran reactor,"" Salehi said. 
""The Tehran reactor has so far been working with old fuel, but modern fuel can improve efficiency,” he added.
Iranian officials have repeatedly criticized delays in setting up a new European Union payments mechanism for Iranian oil exports, which are hit by U.S. sanctions. But Tehran has stopped short of moves that could jeopardize the accord.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord last year, arguing that it was weak because it did not halt Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad, and he reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil export sector.
But Europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security.

The EU and other remaining parties - China and Russia - have tried with limited success to preserve trade incentives for Iran to respect the deal’s nuclear limits under U.S. pressure.

The Centre Party and the Greens have also agreed to back Lofven's future budget bills in a four-party deal that would force the center-left leader to reverse course and deliver tax cuts and labor market reform if he becomes prime minister.
The Liberals' executive committee voted 62-30 in favor of the deal, Swedish newswire TT reported.
The parties will still be short of a majority in the 349-seat parliament and will need support from the Left Party, which backed Lofven's Social Democrat and Green coalition from 2014-18, to pass bills.
September's election delivered a hung parliament and the two major blocs have been at loggerheads over how to form a government without the support of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white-supremacist fringe and who hold the balance of power. 
The speaker will nominate a candidate for the premiership on Monday and parliament will hold a vote on Jan. 16.
Lawmakers have already voted twice against Lofven and once against his rival Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the four-party Alliance that includes the Centre and Liberal parties.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 10:14AM ET</span>",Damascus seeks 'intensified' talks with Kurds: official,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - The Syrian government hopes dialogue with Syrian Kurdish groups will intensify, a minister said on Sunday, signaling support for talks the Kurds hope will lead to a political deal between two of the main players in the multi-sided war. 
The Kurds have sought Russian meditation for the talks with President Bashar al-Assad's government, part of their strategy to fill a vacuum that will be left when U.S. forces withdraw from the country, as instructed by President Donald Trump. 
Their aim is to guard against any invasion by neighboring Turkey, which views the main Syrian Kurdish group - the YPG - as a national security threat, and to preserve autonomy in northern Syria. 
""We hope for the intensification of the dialogue. Many of the Kurdish statements were positive regarding their concern for the unity of Syria,"" Assistant Syrian Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told a small group of journalists in Damascus.
""We are confident that through dialogue we can deal with some of the demands ... and this dialogue guarantees that, as long as it based on a commitment to Syria's unity.""
A political deal could piece back together the two biggest chunks of a country splintered by eight years of war, leaving one corner of the northwest in the hands of anti-Assad rebels backed by Turkey - an adversary of both the YPG and Damascus.
Damascus has previously stated its opposition to the kind of federal state sought by the main Kurdish groups.
A Kurdish politician told Reuters earlier this month that the leadership of northern Syria had presented Russia with a road map for a deal and would pursue one regardless of U.S. plans.
Sousan said intensified dialogue was important when set against challenges, ""especially the expansionist ambitions that lead the policies of the Turkish regime"".
Russia said on Friday it was important for Syria's Kurds and government to start talking in light of U.S. plans.
Trump's decision to withdraw troops has been clouded by mixed messages from Washington since it was abruptly announced last month, catching off guard allies including the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces militia.
The U.S.-led coalition said on Friday it had started the pullout process, but officials later clarified that only equipment, not troops, were being withdrawn.
Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey, and aims to crush its foothold in Syria.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he was optimistic that a ""good outcome"" could be reached between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish groups, after speaking to the Turkish foreign minister.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2019 09:23AM ET</span>",Greece's Tsipras calls confidence vote after ally quits coalition,"By Angeliki Koutantou and Renee Maltezou
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Sunday said he would call a confidence vote in his government after his coalition ally quit, leaving him bereft of a parliamentary majority and raising the possibility of snap elections.
Earlier, Greece's right-wing defense minister resigned in protest at a deal ending a long running dispute with Macedonia over its name, saying he was taking his other six ministers in cabinet with him.
The crisis left the fate of a 2018 deal changing the name of Macedonia to North Macedonia in limbo. Greek parliamentary endorsement of the name is required for the tiny Balkan nation to join the European Union and NATO. Macedonia's parliament has already ratified the accord with a constitutional amendment.
Outgoing Defense Minister Panos Kammenos's Independent Greeks party had seven MPs, enough to get Tsipras's administration past the threshold of 150 deputies in the 300-member parliament. Tsipras's Syriza party has 145 seats and also the support of one independent lawmaker.
""I have taken my decision and have informed the president of parliament that we will immediately move to the process outlined by the constitution for the renewal of the confidence in my government,"" Tsipras told journalists.
The confidence vote is expected to take place later this week and parliamentary speaker Nikos Voutsis proposed Jan. 16. Kammenos said he would not support Tsipras in the vote.
Syriza is trailing between eight and 12 points behind the main conservative New Democracy party, which also opposed the deal with Macedonia, in pre-election polls.
A firebrand leftist, Tsipras was elected in 2015 on a platform of anti-austerity but was forced into a third international bailout to bring back Greece from the brink of bankruptcy. The country exited a bailout program in mid-2018.
Kammenos, who forged a coalition pact with Tsipras in 2015, never concealed his hostility to the deal with Skopje.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and long demanded Skopje change its country name to remove what Athens considered to be an implied claim to Greek sovereign territory.
The wrangle had long frustrated Macedonia's EU and NATO aspirations. Greece is a member of both institutions and has a say in who gets to join, like other member countries.
Kammenos said that any deal including ""Macedonia"" in the name of the Balkan state to Greece's north was unacceptable as the name was irrevocably tied to Greek civilization and culture.

The Greek parliament's vote on the name deal has been expected later this month. The government hopes the pact will pass with the support of center-left and independent lawmakers.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the summit -- to be held in Warsaw over Feb. 13-14 - would focus on stability and security in the Middle East, including the ""important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilizing influence"".
An Iranian foreign ministry official told Poland's charge d'affaires in Tehran that Iran saw the decision to host the meeting as a ""hostile act against Iran"" and warned that Tehran could reciprocate, IRNA added.
""Poland's charge d'affaires provided explanations about the conference and said it was not anti-Iran,"" the agency added. 
The Polish foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
Relations between Tehran and Washington are highly fraught after the decision in May by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and to reimpose sanctions, including on Iran's oil sector. 
CHANGING IRAN'S ""BEHAVIOR""
Speaking in Qatar on Sunday, Pompeo said the aims of the summit will include changing the ""behavior"" of Iran, which Washington accuses of destabilizing the region and supporting terrorism. Tehran denies the accusations and says U.S. military presence in the Middle East causes tensions and instability. 
""We will gather around a number of different topics ... fighting ISIS is part of that ... and address how we can get the Islamic Republic of Iran to behave like a normal nation,"" Pompeo told reporters in Doha.
""There will be countries from Asia, Africa and all across the world. It won't be confined to the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.""
The United States and its regional ally Saudi Arabia back opposing sides in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon. 
On Friday Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticized Poland for hosting the meeting and wrote on Twitter: ""Polish Govt can't wash the shame: while Iran saved Poles in WWII, it now hosts desperate anti-Iran circus.""
Zarif was referring to Iran hosting more that 100,000 Polish refugees during the Second World War.
Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said the summit was being held because U.S. sanctions had failed to bring Iran to its knees.
""Americans thought pressures would break down our economy. They wanted to bring our oil exports to zero but failed ... Now they've decided to hold an anti-Iran conference in Europe,"" the semi-official news agency Fars quoted Jahangiri as saying. 
Meanwhile, a cultural official said that a planned Polish Film Week in Iran would be canceled if the summit plans are not dropped.
""Iranians have hosted various nations and ethnic groups with open arms, especially the Poles,"" Hossein Entezami, head of the Cinema Organization of Iran, said on Twitter. 
""To protect the honor of Iran and Iranians, the holding of the Polish Film Week will depend on Warsaw's appropriate behavior.""

President Ashraf Ghani's decision last month to appoint the fiercely anti-Taliban Asadullah Khalid prompted an outcry from human rights organizations which accuse him of being involved in assassinations, torture and illicit drug business while serving as governor of Ghazni and later of southern Kandahar in 2005 and 2008.
""Credible evidence of serious human rights abuses and war crimes linked to Khalid have followed him throughout his government career,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report published on Saturday.
Brad Adams, Asia Director at HRW called on donors including the United States and Canada to impose sanctions on Khalid, freeze his assets and ban him from entry. 
""The European Union and other donors should impose similar sanctions to send a clear message that returning a known human rights abuser to a position of authority is simply unacceptable,"" he said.
Khalid, , who barely survived a Taliban suicide attack shortly he took over the National Directorate for Security in 2012, denies the charges and says they are politically motivated. 
An uncompromising opponent of the Taliban, Khalid accuses Pakistan of aiding the insurgent group, which Pakistan denies.
His appointment and that of fellow Taliban critic Amrullah Saleh as interior minister come amid growing momentum in talks between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives, who have resisted U.S. pressure to include Ghani's government.

Critics say Khalid's appointment will only complicate peace efforts after 17 years of conflict. It has also fueled accusations that Ghani was trying to neutralize potential opponents by bringing them onto his side ahead of the election.

The Dec. 30 poll was supposed to mark Congo's first uncontested democratic transfer of power in 59 years of restive independence and the beginning of a new era following 18 years of chaotic rule by President Joseph Kabila. 
But runner-up Martin Fayulu claims that he in fact won by a landslide and that the official winner, opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, struck a deal with Kabila to be declared victor. Tshisekedi and Kabila deny this. 
Congo's Catholic Church has said that tallies compiled by its 40,000-strong monitoring team show a different winner to those announced by the electoral commission, without saying who. 
Isolated post-election violence across the massive, mineral-rich country of 80 million people has many fearing a return to the kind of civil-war unrest that have killed millions since the 1990s.
""A recount would provide the necessary reassurance to both winners and losers,"" SADC said in a statement.
SADC, which includes old Kabila allies Angola and South Africa, recommended a government of national unity including parties representing Kabila, Fayulu and Tshisekedi that could promote peace. 
""SADC draws the attention of Congolese politicians to similar arrangements that were very successful in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya"" that created the ""necessary stability for durable peace,"" the statement said.

""He will soon arrive in Brazil and from here will be transferred to Italy to serve a life sentence,"" Filipe G. Martins, a senior aide on international affairs to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, tweeted.
A plane carrying Italian police and intelligence officers is already on its way to South America, Italy's Interior Ministry said on Sunday.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, told television he hoped Battisti would be in Italy by the middle of the week.
Battisti, 64, faces life in prison in his home country, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s. He has denied responsibility for any deaths. 
He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited.
Battisti, who has a five-year-old Brazilian son, spent years in Brazil, backed by former left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
However, Bolsonaro, who took office this month, has pledged to send him back to Italy. In December a Brazilian Supreme Court judge ordered Battisti's arrest but by then he had already gone to ground again.
In a statement on Sunday, Salvini thanked the police and all those involved in the capture of Battisti.
""I thank with all my heart the president Jair Bolsonaro and the new Brazilian government for the changed political climate,"" he said.
Salvini, head of the right-wing League party which partners the 5-Star Movement in Italy's ruling coalition, was one of the first top European politicians to endorse the election of Bolsonaro.
Italian President Sergio Mattarella expressed on Sunday his satisfaction over Battisti's arrest. ""We hope Battisti is swiftly handed over to Italian justice,"" he said.
Battisti, who has become a successful novel writer, said last year he would face torture and death were he to be sent back to Italy.

His lawyer told Reuters last month that he had filed an appeal against the Brazilian Supreme Court decision, seeking to block another attempt to extradite his client.

Houthi spokesman Yahya Sarea said Thursday's drone strike on a military base in Lahaj province, which killed several people, was a ""legitimate operation against aggression"". He said the movement was building a stockpile locally manufactured drones.
""Soon there will be enough in the strategic stockpile to launch more than one drone operation in multiple battle fronts at the same time,"" Sarea told reporters in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa.
The attack on the military parade came as the United Nations tries to get peace talks going between the Houthis, who control most urban centers in Yemen, and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is based in the southern port city of Aden.
The day after, a Saudi-led military coalition said it destroyed a Houthi communication and control center used to direct drones.
The Houthis said in November they were halting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies, but tensions have risen over how to implement a U.N.-sponsored peace deal reached in December in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are leading the Western-backed Sunni Muslim Arab coalition that intervened in Yemen's war after the Houthis ousted Hadi's government from Sanaa in 2014. 
The Gulf states accuse Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, a charge Tehran and the group deny. The Houthis say they are waging a revolution against corruption.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel acknowledged on Sunday that it carried out a weekend air strike on what it called an Iranian arms cache in Syria, and that it also completed a hunt for cross-border tunnels dug by Tehran-allied Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas.
Long wary of publicity around its operations against Iran-linked targets on its northern front, Israel has been lifting the veil in recent days - a sign of confidence in a campaign waged amid occasional tension with Syria's big-power backer, Russia. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may also be playing up his security credentials as he seeks re-election on April 9. 
""We have been taking action with impressive success to arrest Iran's military entrenchment in Syria,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet in televised remarks, saying this entailed ""hundreds"" of attacks over the past several years of Syria's civil war, in which Iranian and Hezbollah forces have backed the Damascus government against rebels and Islamist insurgents.
""In just the last 36 hours, the air force struck Iran's warehouses, containing Iranian arms, in Damascus international airport,"" he added, referring to a Friday night sortie that Syria said it had answered with anti-aircraft fire.
Syrian state media said at the time of the attack that the damage was limited to a hit on a warehouse at Damascus airport.
Netanyahu also cited an Israeli search-and-dismantle mission against suspected Hezbollah attack tunnels along the border with Lebanon that was launched in December and deemed completed on Sunday.
The Israeli military said a sixth tunnel was found on Saturday, 55 meters (yards) deep and reaching ""a few tens of meters"" into Israeli territory from 800 meters within Lebanon. 
""According to our assessments, there are no longer any tunnels crossing into Israel,"" military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. He added that Hezbollah retained underground facilities on the Lebanese side.
Hezbollah has not commented on the tunnels, the existence of several of which was confirmed by U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon.
Hezbollah and Israel last fought a war in 2006. While they have at times traded blows within Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the Israel-Lebanon border has mostly been quiet.

Citing intelligence assessments, Israel's outgoing armed forces chief, Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot, told a local TV station on Saturday that the tunnels were prepared in secret, over a period of years. He said this was part of a Hezbollah plan to send as many as 1,500 fighters to infiltrate Israeli border communities during any future war.

DHAKA (Reuters) - The head of Bangladesh's garment manufacturers association on Sunday called on protesting workers to return to work by Monday or companies will cut off their pay, after demonstrations calling for higher salaries that have lasted for a week. 
The workers' protests, which have broken down into clashes between police and protesters that killed one worker on Tuesday and wounded dozens more last week, pushed the Bangladesh government to consider the demand for higher pay. The country is the world's second-biggest garment exporter behind China.
Seeking to end the turmoil, Siddiqur Rahman, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) threatened to cut off the workers' pay at a news conference after further clashes on Sunday.
""If you don't return to your work by tomorrow, you will not be paid any wages and we will shut down factories for an indefinite period,"" he said. ""Despite repeated assurance of meeting the demands, the workers are being incited to create unrest. We will not allow this anymore.""
At least 20 people were hurt after police used teargas and water cannons to disperse workers, who blocked a major highway in the Ashulia garment manufacturing hub, said Saminur Rahman, a director for the Industrial Police, which patrols the country's business hubs.
The Ashulia hub, on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, accounts for nearly 20 percent of Bangladesh's total garment exports. 
The protests are a test for the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won a third straight term in elections on Dec. 30, which were marred by violence amid allegations of widespread rigging and voter intimidation.
The government said in September that the minimum wage for garment workers would increase by up to 51 percent to 8,000 taka ($95) a month, payable in January, the first increase since 2013.
But union leaders say that increase will benefit only a small percentage of workers in the garment sector, which employs 4 million out of the country's 165 million people.
The government has formed a panel of factory owners, union leaders and officials to investigate the pay demands, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said on Tuesday, adding he hoped a resolution could be reached in a month.
""The panel will meet this afternoon. The workers will have to accept their decision,"" BGMEA's Rahman said.

Low wages and trade deals with Western countries have made the sector a $30 billion industry accounting for 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports.

The group of four had been using touring skis, which enable skiers to climb as well as ski down slopes and explore off-piste, police in the western province of Vorarlberg said. 
The three dead men, from the Upper Swabia area of southwestern Germany, were found around 11 p.m. (2200 GMT) after one of their wives declared them missing. They were aged 57, 36 and 32. The fourth person, who is 28 and also from southern Germany, was still missing, a police statement said.

Heavy snow has hit the Austrian Alps in the past week, raising avalanche warning levels and cutting off local roads. The warning level in the area above 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) on Saturday was 3 on a scale that goes up to 5.

(Reuters) - A winter storm that dumped heavy snow on the U.S. Midwest, causing at least five roadway deaths, stranding some motorists in Missouri and canceling dozens of flights, marched east toward Washington on Saturday.
The weather system, which started as rain from Mexico but has since turned into snow, is forecast to affect an 1,800-mile (2,900 km) swath of the United States from Colorado to the Mid-Atlantic.
The storm hit Kansas and Missouri on Friday and pummeled those states again on Saturday as it extended into parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said U.S. Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Andrew Orrison.
In Kansas City, snow dusted the field at Arrowhead Stadium during Saturday's National Football League playoff game between the hometown Chiefs and Indianapolis Colts. 
""There's snow time like Showtime,"" the Chiefs said on Twitter, sharing video of the team's quarterback Patrick Mahomes arriving at the stadium in the snow.
The storm is leaving its heaviest snowfall on areas west of St. Louis, where about a foot and a half of snow was recorded, with still more falling on Saturday, Orrison said.
At least five people died in weather-related crashes on roads in Missouri and Kansas, according to the highway patrolmen in both states.
""I think it's safe to say that every road is bad in Kansas right now!"" Trooper Tod Hileman, a spokesman for the Kansas Highway Patrol, said on Twitter on Saturday.
Dozens of flights were canceled at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, which described the onslaught of snow on Twitter as one of its biggest single-day winter storms in years.
Snow is forecast for the Appalachian Mountains and the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday evening and Sunday. 
""Given how cold it is across the Midwest and even in the mid-Atlantic region, certainly people who are going to be out are going to want to dress in layered clothing,"" Orrison said.
Washington, where many federal government offices are closed due to the U.S. government shutdown, is expected to receive 6 to 8 inches (15 cm to 20 cm) of snow from this storm, according to the National Weather Service.
Central and northern Virginia will receive even more, with up to 10 inches of snow possible in some places. Baltimore and parts of Maryland are also bracing for a similar amount. 

Philadelphia is expected to receive a few inches of snow, but areas north of there are expected to be spared, Orrison added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's federal government has ordered local governments to hold naturalization ceremonies for new citizens on Australia Day amid controversy over the holiday, which some claim is offensive to its indigenous people. 
The government is proposing that all local government bodies in Australia, typically referred to as councils, must hold induction ceremonies for new citizens on the Australia Day holiday on Jan. 26 and the Australian Citizenship Day holiday on Sept. 17 or have their authorization revoked, Immigration Minister David Coleman said in an emailed statement on Sunday.
Australia Day marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the first British fleet to Sydney Cove where the British flag was raised on the continent marking the start of colonization.
Aborigines trace their lineage on the island continent back 50,000 years and for them, the date marks the start of the loss of their cultural heritage and suffering under discriminatory policies.
The holiday has become controversial with pressure by activists to change the date from what they call ""Invasion Day"".
The country's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
Several local councils have stopped holding citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day because of concerns the date is insulting to Aborigines.
At a press conference televised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Sunday, Immigration Minister Coleman said more than 100 of the country's 537 councils do not hold citizenship ceremonies on the Australia Day holiday. 
However, Australian Local Government Association President David O'Loughlin said councils hold multiple citizenship ceremonies throughout the year and the majority of those who skip Australia Day do so for practical reasons.
“It's a very expensive undertaking to do a public event on a public holiday,” he told Reuters on Sunday. “About two or three only moved the day for ideological reasons.”

The proposed changes to the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code are planned for introduction by the first half of 2019, the minister's statement said. Coleman plans to write to the councils and receive feedback on the changes, the statement said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The mood at Latin America's largest wholesale market, the Central de Abastos in Mexico City, has morphed from typically cacophonous and bustling to cloudy and anxious as deliveries and sales grow sluggish amid a days-long fuel shortage.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador late last month launched a sweeping plan to stanch rampant fuel theft, the first major move of his young administration against widespread corruption and organized crime.
But the move to close key fuel pipelines that have been tapped by criminals and instead re-route distribution via trucks has prompted hours-long lines at gas stations, while threatening to crimp the economy and damage the president's popularity if shortages persist.
The effects of the crackdown have grown noticeably in the past week. At the Central de Abastos, where 62,000 cars and trucks converge daily to buy and sell fruits, plants and other goods, according to figures provided by the market, vendors say many have been staying home.
""Forty to 50 percent of supply has been affected,"" said Rafael Perez, 43, the purchasing director for Drinks Depot, a beverages wholesaler. ""We are talking about suppliers from [the states of] Hidalgo, Guerrero, Cuernavaca, Puebla and Tlaxcala.""
""Our suppliers' deliveries have been impacted,"" Perez added. ""Customers are not coming."" 
Avocado vendor Juan Carlos Ximil, 35, said he had seen a drop of about 30 to 40 percent in sales of his stock, which he normally purchases from suppliers outside the capital, including Morelos, Edomex and the avocado-producing state of Michoacan.
His customers, modest street-side vendors and grocery stores with limited means of transport, have stayed away too, he said, most likely because fears of long waits to stock up on gasoline, or a shortage itself, would hit hard at their carefully calibrated daily routines.
""I feel like, more than a shortage, there is a kind of collective panic,"" said Ximil. ""If you were used to consuming 200 pesos ($10.45) of gas you go and load up even if you don't need it, for fear that you'll run out.""

The accident is the deadliest reported so far this year in China's coal industry, known for its poor safety record. 
It occurred at Baiji Mining Co Ltd's Lijiagou mine in the city of Shenmu at around 4:30 p.m. (0830 GMT) on Saturday, when 87 people were underground, the People's Daily said. 
Sixty-six miners were rescued but 21 were trapped underground, it reported. Nineteen of the miners were confirmed dead at first while a search continued for the two missing miners; however, they were later found dead. 
Some mining firms in major coal hubs in Shandong and Henan provinces and parts of northeastern China have received notices from the National Coal Mine Safety Administration asking them to halt operations for inspections that will last until June, the state-backed Shanghai Securities News (SSN) reported on Friday.
On Sunday, the Xinhua News Agency said that Shanxi province, which borders Shaanxi, would also carry out inspections at high-risk coal mines.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government claimed victory on Saturday in a diplomatic quarrel with Latin American countries over a border dispute with Guyana, while ignoring an avalanche of criticism over President Nicolas Maduro's second term in office.
Maduro had warned members of the so-called Lima Group of ""diplomatic measures"" after they said on Jan. 4 that they would not recognize his second term because Venezuela's 2018 election was not free or fair.
The statement, signed by nations including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, also expressed concern that Venezuela had violated Guyana's sovereignty by stopping a ship doing offshore oil exploration on behalf of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). 
Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said at a news conference on Saturday that 10 of the 12 governments that signed the statement had since clarified their position on the Guyana dispute. 
""We believe that regional diplomacy has convinced these countries"" to reconsider the border issue, Arreaza said. ""Diplomacy has ensured the rule of law.""
He said he hoped that the other two countries - Paraguay and Canada - would follow the example of the bloc's other members. Paraguay cut diplomatic ties with Venezuela on Thursday. 
Arreaza did not address the Group's broader point about the legitimacy of Maduro, who was sworn in on Thursday, except to denounce the bloc's Jan. 4 statement as ""vulgar"" interference in Venezuelan internal affairs.
The OPEC nation's 2018 vote was widely boycotted by the opposition and condemned as rigged by governments around the world. Maduro insists it was fair and that opposition leaders did not take part because they knew they would lose.
Speaking in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described Maduro's government as illegitimate and said the United States would work with like-minded nations in Latin America to restore democracy in Venezuela.
Arreaza responded on Twitter by accusing Pompeo of ""openly promoting a coup in Venezuela by encouraging the disavowal of the constitution and the will of the people.""
The head of the country's opposition-run Congress, Juan Guaido, said on Friday that he was prepared to assume the presidency on an interim basis and call elections, because Maduro had been declared illegitimate.

Congress has been stripped of powers by the Supreme Court and a pro-Maduro legislature known as the Constituent Assembly, and the impact of Guaido's remarks was not immediately clear. Brazil's government said on Saturday that it recognized the opposition lawmaker as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

Protesters brought together by the Alliance for Serbia, a loose grouping of 30 opposition parties and organizations, chanted ""Vucic, thief!"" in the sixth such protest in as many weeks.
The opposition rally comes ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit scheduled for next Thursday. 
While Vucic says membership of the European Union remains Serbia's ultimate goal, he maintains close ties with Russia, long a Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally of the country. 
Putin's visit is seen as a popularity booster for Vucic and his ruling coalition, and his supporters have scheduled a major rally for Thursday to welcome the Russian president.
Protesters in Belgrade have also accused Vucic of preparing a negotiated settlement with Kosovo, a key precondition for Serbia to join EU. Belgrade enjoys Russia's backing in its opposition to Kosovo independence declared in 2008, almost a decade after a brutal 1998-1999 war there.
""Vucic has a compromise with everyone, with (Kosovo President Hashim) Thaci, with (Kosovo's Prime Minister Ramush) Haradinaj, ... with everyone but honest people... That is a compromise for treason,"" Rada Trajkovic, a Kosovo Serb politician told cheering crowd.
Protesters also demanded that the government find those responsible for the killing of Oliver Ivanovic, a prominent Kosovo Serb politician, a year ago. They also announced a rally in Belgrade for next Wednesday to commemorate his death.
In December, Vucic said he would not bow to opposition demands ""even if there were 5 million people in the street"", but said he would be willing to hold a snap election. Opposition parties said they would boycott such an election. 

Vucic has the backing of around 53 percent of the electorate. His coalition also has a majority of 160 deputies in the 250 seat parliament. If the opposition parties ran as an alliance, they could count on only around 15 percent of the vote.

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris police fired water cannon and tear gas to push back ""yellow vest"" demonstrators from around the Arc de Triomphe monument on Saturday, in the ninth straight weekend of protests against French President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms.
Thousands of protesters in Paris marched noisily but mostly peacefully through the Grands Boulevards shopping area in northern Paris, close to where a massive gas explosion in a bakery killed two firefighters and a Spanish tourist and injured nearly 50 people early on Saturday.
But small groups of demonstrators broke away from the designated route and threw bottles and other projectiles at the police.
Around the 19th-century Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs Elysees boulevard, riot police fired water cannon and tear gas at militant protesters after being pelted with stones and paint, witnesses said.
Groups of protesters also gathered on and around the Champs Elysees, the scene of disturbances in recent weeks, many of them calling loudly for Macron to resign. 
""Macron, we are going to tear down your place!"" one banner read. 
The Interior Ministry estimated that there were a maximum of about 84,000 demonstrators nationwide on Saturday - more than the 50,000 counted last week but well below the record 282,000 estimated on Nov. 17, the first day of the protests. 
In Paris, the ministry counted 8,000 demonstrators, more than in the past two weekends, when authorities tallied just 3,500 people on Jan. 5 and only 800 on Dec. 29.
Much of central Paris was in lockdown on the first week of post-Christmas sales, with bridges across the Seine river closed and official buildings such as parliament and the Elysee presidential palace protected by police barriers.
In Paris, 156 ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters were arrested, some for carrying objects that could be used as weapons, police said. As of 2000 GMT, 108 remained in custody. Nationwide, 244 people had been arrested, of which 201 remained in custody. 
By nightfall, there had been no looting or burning of cars as seen in previous weeks and traffic circulation had resumed around the Arc de Triomple area. 
NATIONAL DEBATE
There were also thousands of marchers in the cities of Bordeaux and Toulon in southern France as well as Strasbourg in the east and the central city of Bourges.
Bourges authorities said nearly 5,000 yellow vests stuck to the designated demonstration area. The historical city center was off-limits for demonstrators, but some 500 protesters made their way to the center where they scuffled with police and set garbage bins on fire. 
Many businesses in Bourges had boarded themselves up to avoid damage and authorities had removed street furniture and building site materials that could be used for barricades. 
In Strasbourg, up to 2,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the European Parliament building and later marched to the center of the city on the Rhine river border with Germany. No serious violence or looting was reported there.
More than 80,000 police were on duty for the protests nationwide, including 5,000 in Paris. 
The ""yellow vests"" take their name from the high-visibility jackets they wear. Their rage stems from a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Macron, a former investment banker seen as close to big business, is indifferent to their hardships.
Macron, often criticized for a monarchical manner, is to launch a national debate on Jan. 15 to try to mollify the yellow vest protest, which has shaken his administration.

The debate, to be held on the internet and in town halls, will focus on four themes - taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship. But aides to Macron have said changing the course of Macron's reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy will be off limits.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition Congress party will simplify the goods and services tax (GST) and take ""rational economic decisions"" to attract foreign investment if voted back to power in a general election due by May, its leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday.
Launched in 2017, the GST was initially hailed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biggest economic reform as it replaced more than a dozen federal and state levies and unified Asia's third largest economy.
But its chaotic implementation and complexities https://in.reuters.com/article/india-election-tax-insight/indias-tax-effect-hundreds-of-thousands-laid-off-despite-growth-idINKCN1LL36M -- months after a shock ban by Modi on high value bank currency aimed at unearthing untaxed wealth -- badly hurt small businesses and led to millions of job losses in the cash-driven economy, presenting the biggest challenge to Modi's re-election chances.
Gandhi, scion of India's Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, said during a visit to Dubai that foreign investment was at a multi-year low in India due to the ""ill-advised and badly thought out economic moves"" such as the currency ban and a ""poorly designed GST"".
""We will take some rational economic decisions,"" he told a press conference, which was broadcast live on Twitter. ""We will restructure the GST and we will embrace investments from the Middle East and other parts of the world. We are the party of (India's economic) liberalization, we are the party that gave the fastest economic growth in the first decade of the century, and will do that again.""
He said his main priority would be to create jobs, simplify the GST, rebuild confidence in institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India -- whose governor resigned recently after a fight over autonomy with the government, and the Supreme Court.
Four Supreme Court judges held a rare press conference early last year saying that ""unless this institution is preserved and it maintains its equanimity, democracy will not survive in this country"".
Modi told a BJP convention in New Delhi on Saturday that for Congress ""every institution was wrong and only they were right"".
The Congress press conference was organized by the Indian Overseas Congress, which is present in about 35 countries, as Gandhi tries to reach out to rich Indians living abroad for funds and social media support for the party that has dominated the country's politics for decades before being nearly decimated in the last general election in 2014 by Modi.
But back home, Gandhi received a jolt when bitter rivals Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) announced an election tie-up https://in.reuters.com/article/india-election-uttar-pradesh-sp-bsp/sp-bsp-unite-in-uttar-pradesh-in-a-bid-to-beat-modi-in-election-idINKCN1P51SP without Congress in Uttar Pradesh state, which sends the highest number of lawmakers to the lower house of parliament.
""The BSP and SP have made a political decision,"" Gandhi said. ""It's on us on how to strengthen the Congress party in Uttar Pradesh and we will fight with our full capacity. Whether we do or their alliance does, the BJP is not winning there.""
Modi said at the Delhi convention that the opposition was working on a ""desperate alliance"", while the BJP would give a ""strong government"".

The Hindu nationalist BJP lost power in three key states recently, forcing the government to announce a flurry of measures to woo small businesses and the less well-off since then.

Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen is the head of Nigeria's judiciary, which plays a key role in election matters and has helped resolve disputes in past votes.
The conduct tribunal, which tries asset-declaration misdemeanors, said in a statement on Saturday that Onnoghen would face six separate counts, without giving further details.
Onnoghen could not be reached for comment.
Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave. The court did not say why it had brought the charges against Onnoghen almost two years into his tenure.
The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling party of plotting to destabilize the judiciary ahead of elections by seeking to remove Onnoghen, which could cause a constitutional crisis.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas Democrat Julian Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and top U.S. housing official, formally launched his White House bid on Saturday, entering as a dark horse candidate in a likely crowded field vying to challenge President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.
Castro, 44, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant who would be the first Hispanic elected president, served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under former President Barack Obama and has long been viewed as a rising star in the party. He will seek to position himself as a political outsider with liberal credentials.
""I'm running for president because it's time for new leadership. Because it's time for new energy,"" Castro said, launching his campaign. ""And it's time for a new commitment to make sure that the opportunities I've had are available for every American.""
One of Castro's first stops as a candidate will take place on Monday in Puerto Rico, where he will attend an event hosted by the liberal Latino Victory Fund. 
He made his announcement at Plaza Guadalupe, a landmark in San Antonio's sprawling west side Mexican-American barrio, a neighborhood of neat, brightly painted wood framed homes, many on tiny lots and festooned with white plaster Catholic statues. 
In summarizing his political positions, Castro endorsed ""Medicare for all,"" which would in effect create a national healthcare plan by allowing anyone to join the public healthcare system. That policy point is likely to divide Democrats in the primary, with more moderate candidates favoring a less drastic approach.
He used his launch to repeat support of the Black Lives Matter movement. He spoke about the need to address climate change. 
Castro, whose grandmother was born in Mexico, has sought to use his family's personal story to criticize Trump's border policies - including criticizing the president by name in his launch speech.
""Yes, we must have border security, but there is a smart and humane way to do it. And there is no way in hell that caging children is keeping us safe,"" Castro said. 
Castro is the second candidate to formally launch a campaign. Former U.S. Representative John Delaney has been running for more than a year. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has formed an exploratory committee and Representative Tulsi Gabbard said Friday that she will run for president.
More than a dozen potential Democratic candidates are exploring a possible run for president in 2020. Moderates and progressives in the party have been debating about how to best challenge Trump, the likely Republican nominee.
Some Democrats believe an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters is the way to win back the White House. Others contend a fresh face is needed to energize the party's increasingly left-leaning base. 
Castro, who was considered on the short list to be Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 election, has been out of the political spotlight for the past two years, at a time when politics has become all-consuming across America. 
Mark Jones, a political analyst at Rice University in Houston, who has followed Castro's career, says despite this, his chances of securing the nomination in what is certain to be a crowded field are slim at best.
""Julian Castro shouldn't be counted out completely,"" Jones said. ""That said, his star is definitely not rising anymore, and the sun may be setting on the presidential ambitions of Julian Castro."" 
Castro would be the first identical twin elected president.

His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas. Joaquin Castro's position on the House Intelligence Committee has made him a frequent public critic of the president.

TORONTO (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family this week saying she feared for her life arrived in Toronto's international airport on Saturday after being granted asylum in Canada, where Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland welcomed her as a brave new Canadian.
Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun grabbed international attention this week after she barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to resist being sent home to her family, which denies any abuse. Qunun refused to meet her father and brother, who arrived in Bangkok to try to take her back to Saudi Arabia. 
Qunun arrived at Toronto's Pearson International Airport on Saturday morning, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word Canada in red, and a blue cap with the logo of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which has granted her refugee status. 
In her last tweet before leaving for Toronto, Qunun said, ""I did it,"" and posted pictures from inside an airplane.
Freeland, who received Qunun at the airport, told reporters that Qunun is ""a very brave new Canadian."" 
""Rahaf wanted Canadians to see that she has arrived at her new home,"" Freeland told reporters. ""But she had a very long and tiring journey and so would prefer not to take questions today. And she is now going to go to her new home.""
A smiling Qunun waved to reporters as she walked out into the international arrivals area but did not speak to the media. After a brief appearance, she was taken back into the airport terminal.
Canada's decision to grant asylum to Qunun comes at a delicate time. Relations between Ottawa and Riyadh have been tense after Canada demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists last year, infuriating Saudi Arabia who retaliated by freezing new trade with Ottawa.
Qunun, who had initially intended to seek asylum in Australia, chose Canada instead because Australia took too long assessing whether to grant her asylum. 
""(Australia) takes too long. That's why I went to Canada,"" she told Reuters in a direct message before boarding her flight to Toronto. Qunun took a Korean Air flight from Bangkok to Seoul on Friday and then a connecting flight to Toronto.
Her case has drawn global attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
Qunun arrived in Bangkok a week ago and was initially denied entry. But she soon started posting messages on Twitter from the transit area of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport saying she had ""escaped Kuwait"" and her life would be in danger if forced to return to Saudi Arabia. 
Within hours, a campaign sprang up dubbed #SaveRahaf, spread on Twitter by a loose network of activists.

Following a 48-hour stand-off at Bangkok airport, some of it barricaded in a transit lounge hotel room, she was allowed to enter the country and was processed as a refugee by the UNHCR.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",South Africa's ANC says central bank should broaden economic focus,"By Siyabonga Sishi and Alexander Winning
DURBAN/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling party said on Saturday the central bank should broaden its focus to include boosting employment and economic growth, a move that will worry investors already concerned about the direction of economic policy.
The African National Congress (ANC), which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994 but has seen its majority wane, is trying to woo voters in the lead-up to a parliamentary election expected to take place in May.
The party led by President Cyril Ramaphosa wants to counter growing support for the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters, which wants the government to have a greater say in how the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is managed.
The SARB's mandate now focuses on price stability, but the ANC said in its 2019 election manifesto released on Saturday that monetary policy should also ""take into account other objectives such as employment creation and economic growth"".
Past attempts to alter the SARB's mandate have caused the rand  to weaken. The economy has only recently climbed out of recession triggered in part by investor worries about policies such as the ANC's plans to make the SARB fully state-owned and allow land expropriation without compensation.
""The ANC believes the South African Reserve Bank must pursue a flexible monetary policy regime, aligned with the objectives of the second phase of transition,"" the manifesto said, promising renewed efforts to tackle unemployment and racial inequalities.
Enoch Godongwana, the chairman of the ANC's economic transformation committee, denied that the ANC was preparing to change the mandate of the SARB.
He told Reuters the manifesto merely reflected an intention for more coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities, adding ""the independence of the Reserve Bank is sacrosanct"".
The central bank guards its independence and has opposed attempts to alter its mandate, which is enshrined in the constitution. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.
ANC DIVISIONS
The ANC is divided into two broad factions with divergent views on how the economy should be managed. One supports Ramaphosa's drive to boost private investment, while another loyal to his predecessor Jacob Zuma backs a strong state role.
Towards the end of Zuma's nine years in power, South Africa's anti-graft watchdog tried unsuccessfully to make the central bank promote economic growth rather than price stability.
In September, the ANC hastily retracted a statement calling on the SARB to do more to help the poor after an intervention by Godongwana, a member of Ramaphosa's faction.
Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex, said the manifesto comments were a concern although he did not expect the SARB's mandate to change in the short term.
""The fact the manifesto specifically links the monetary policy committee's actions to the 'second phase of transition' is an explicit benchmarking of monetary policy against political aims,"" he said. 
""It sets the SARB up for criticism in future as counter-revolutionaries and can further fuel the nationalisation debate,"" he added.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2019 12:52PM ET</span>",Turkey's military reinforces on border with Syria's Idlib,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish troops and tanks carried out military exercises on the border with Syria on Saturday, state-run media reported, while a monitoring group said a Turkish convoy had crossed the frontier into northern Syria.
Turkey's military sent tanks and armored vehicles to the border in the second day of reinforcements near the province of Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in Syria.
On Friday, a Turkish security source said the Turkish army had been rotating forces in and out of the region, and declined to say whether the latest movement was in preparation for an operation inside Syria itself.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group, said a Turkish convoy had entered Syria.
Islamist fighters have tightened their control over the Idlib region following more than a week of fighting with Turkey-backed Syrian rebels. 
The rise of the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al Sham has raised doubt over the future of a deal agreed in September between Turkey - which has several military observation posts in Idlib - and President Bashar al-Assad's main ally Russia to avert a Syrian government army assault. The agreement requires banned Islamist groups to be expelled from a frontline buffer zone.
The escalation in Idlib comes as U.S. forces prepare to withdraw from a separate region of northern and eastern Syria. 
Earlier on Saturday, the Turkish defense minister, chief of general staff and the intelligence agency head visited border military units and discussed ""measures to establish peace and stability in the region,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""We are making every effort to preserve the ceasefire and stability in Idlib, in line with the Sochi agreement. Our close cooperation with Russia continues,"" Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said.

Akar's comments came a day after Russia said it remained committed to the agreement it had struck with Turkey to stabilize a de-escalation zone in Idlib, but said Moscow was worried by an increase in the number of ceasefire violations.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he was optimistic that a ""good outcome"" could be reached between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish groups, after speaking to the Turkish foreign minister. 
""We recognize the Turkish people's right to defend their country from terrorists, but we also know that those ... who are not terrorists and fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected,"" Pompeo told reporters.
""There are many details to be worked out but I am optimistic we can achieve a good outcome,"" he said.
Relations between the two NATO allies have been strained over U.S. backing for the Kurdish YPG, which Turkey views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil.
Pompeo said his phone call with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu involved several elements of U.S.-Turkey relations, including Syria and the detention of Americans in Turkey.
He said the U.S. envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, had traveled to northeast Syria this week and would soon go to Ankara for talks, including on moving forward a UN-led political process to end the eight-year long conflict in Syria.
He suggested that talks between Damascus and the Syrian Kurds could be part of a broader political solution in Syria.
""We hope we can turn the corner here,"" Pompeo added. 
Kurdish-led groups who control swathes of northern Syria fear an attack from Turkey in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops from their region. Turkey sees the Kurdish YPG militia close to its border as a security threat.
Trump's decision to withdraw the troops hinges on Turkey's cooperation to secure the northern border. But Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to crush the Kurdish groups that have been effective in defeating Islamic State in Syria.
Speaking in Abu Dhabi as part of a regional tour, Pompeo said the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria was a ""tactical change"" but the mission to destroy Islamic State and counter Iran's influence remained the same.
In a speech in Cairo on Thursday, Pompeo vowed that the United States would ""expel every last Iranian boot"" from Syria, where Tehran is supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
""It's an ambitious objective, but it is ours, and it is our mission,"" he added.
The speech sought to lay out the Trump administration's strategy for the Middle East and criticized former U.S. President Barack Obama, without naming him, for ""fundamental misunderstandings"" about the Middle East.
Pompeo said on Saturday the speech had not taken aim at individuals but rather the ideas of the previous administration, adding that the Obama-era policies opened the way for Islamic State and the spread of Iran's influence in the region.

They told Reuters that civil defense forces had failed to contain the fire sparked by an explosion on Friday. The cause of the blast is still unknown.
Aden is under the control of the internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led and Western-backed coalition and which is battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that seized the capital Sanaa in 2014.
The United Nations launched peace talks last month to try to end the nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people, devastated the economy and left millions facing severe hunger. But tensions have resurged since then.
A Houthi drone attack on Thursday on a government military parade in Lahaj, a province next to Aden, killed several people. Saudi state television said on Friday the coalition destroyed a base used by Houthis to direct their unmanned aircraft.
The Houthis deny receiving help from Tehran and say they are fighting against corruption. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran.

Macedonia's parliament on Friday passed an amendment to the constitution to rename the country Republic of North Macedonia, in line with an agreement with Greece to put an end to a 27-year-old dispute.
Many Greeks are irked that their Balkan neighbor is assuming a name linked to Greek heritage and identical to a northern region of Greece. 
The countries struck the deal in June, but Macedonia will start using the new name only after the parliament in Athens also ratifies the agreement. A vote is expected later this month.
The order for a preliminary investigation came after two Greek news websites reported that lawmakers had received threatening text messages to vote against the deal, the source said.
The probe will seek to determine whether there has been a violation of personal data and inducement to commit a crime, the source added.
The Macedonia accord has strained relations between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his junior coalition partner Panos Kammenos.
Kammenos, defense minister and head of the right-wing Independent Greeks (ANEL) has vowed to reject the deal but at least one of his deputies has said publicly he will support it. It is unclear how other ANEL lawmakers will vote.
The left-right governing coalition has a razor-thin majority with 153 seats in the 300 member parliament. Seven of those seats belong to ANEL. 
The main opposition New Democracy party has said it will block the deal. The government hopes the deal will pass with the support of center-left and independent lawmakers.

Khetab Emir was killed in the raid on Jan 10 in the eastern area of Nangarhar province, said Lt. Ubon Mendie, a spokesman for the U.S. forces based in Afghanistan.
Emir, who was known by multiple names, facilitated high-profile attacks and supplied Islamic State fighters with weapons and materials to make explosives, Mendie said in a statement.
""His removal helps protect innocent Afghans from future Islamic State violence and weakens their presence in Nangarhar,"" Mendie said.
Islamic State fighters have developed a stronghold in the province on Afghanistan's eastern border with Pakistan and have become one of the country's most dangerous militant groups.
The hardline militant group's local affiliate, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) after an old name for the region that includes Afghanistan, has been active since 2015, fighting the Taliban as well as Afghan and foreign forces.
The fight against Islamic State and other militant groups including Al Qaeda and the Taliban is at the heart of the U.S. led counterterrorism mission being conducted alongside the NATO-led Resolute Support operation aimed at training and advising Afghan security forces.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Outgoing Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila's ruling coalition won a majority in legislative elections, a coalition official said on Saturday, despite opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi's win in the presidential vote the same day.
The result will undercut Tshisekedi's ability to deliver on campaign promises to make a break with the 18-year Kabila era and fuel suspicion that his victory, announced on Thursday, came through a backroom deal that will preserve Kabila's influence over important ministries and the security forces.
Kabila is due to step down in the coming days in what was meant to be Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence. But he has signaled he intends to remain involved in politics and might run for president in 2023 when term limits no longer apply. 
The runner-up in the presidential election, Martin Fayulu, filed a fraud complaint on Saturday with Congo's highest court to challenge the result, a campaign spokeswoman, Eve Bazaiba, told Reuters. 
Fayulu says he won in a landslide in the Dec. 30 ballot with more than 60 percent of votes and accuses Tshisekedi of striking a deal with Kabila to be declared the winner.
Tshisekedi's camp denies that there was any deal with Kabila and says meetings it held with the president's representatives after the election were meant solely to ensure a peaceful transfer of power.
The disputed outcome threatens to reawaken violence in the huge and tumultuous central African country where millions have died during civil wars since the 1990s.
In a tweet before filing the complaint, Fayulu wrote that the election commission CENI's results ""were invented out of whole cloth. I demand a hand recount of all votes for the three elections (presidential, national legislative and provincial)"".
The court has eight days to rule, but Fayulu has already said he does not expect a favorable judgment since the court is made up of Kabila appointees. 
Earlier in the day, about 50 Republican Guard soldiers and police officers surrounded Fayulu's residence, sending dozens of his supporters, who had been chanting against Kabila and Tshisekedi, fleeing inside, a Reuters witness said. 
Fayulu's supporters have demonstrated in several cities since the results were announced. Protests in the western city of Kikwit on Thursday turned violent, killing at least four demonstrators and two police officers. 
LITTLE ROOM FOR MANEUVER
The parliamentary majority retained by the handful of parties in Kabila's coalition will curtail Tshisekedi's room for maneuver. Under the constitution, the majority enjoys significant powers and the president must appoint his prime minister from its ranks. 
The prime minister, in turn, must countersign presidential orders appointing or dismissing military chiefs, judges and heads of state-owned enterprises. 
Adam Chalwe, a national secretary for Kabila's PPRD party, the biggest within the FCC coalition, told Reuters that results from the individual races announced by CENI on Saturday morning showed FCC candidates taking more than 300 out of 500 seats in the National Assembly.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm that independently. 
Parties in the FCC coalition accounted for about 350 seats in the previous legislature. 
The coalition's presidential candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, finished a distant third with 24 percent of the vote. Pre-election polling had shown the FCC lagging behind opposition parties in legislative races.
Jean Jacques Mamba, a spokesman for the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) party that backs Fayulu and which polls had shown leading the legislative race, said it had won 22 seats, instead of the 40-50 it had expected.

He accused CENI of rigging the vote using electronic voting machines. CENI officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Two firefighters died and nearly people 50 were injured in a massive gas explosion that gutted the ground floor of a building in a central Paris shopping district on Saturday, authorities said. 
The accident occurred with Paris under security lockdown for a ninth consecutive Saturday of ""yellow vest"" protests, with large parts of the French capital blocked off by riot police. 
""As firemen were looking for a gas leak in the building, a dramatic explosion took place,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, adding that one of the firemen had been buried under debris for several hours.
Castaner said on his Twitter feed that two firefighters had died, and that 10 people, including one firefighter, had serious injuries. Another 37 people had lighter injuries, he said. Earlier he had told reporters that two civilians had also died. 
Just hours after the blast, thousands of yellow vest protesters marched noisily but peacefully through the Grands Boulevards shopping district of northern Paris, just a few hundred yards from the scene of the explosion. 
In recent years, France has suffered a string of deadly Islamist militant attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and elsewhere but authorities quickly ruled out foul play. 
""A this stage we can say it (the gas blast) is clearly an accident,"" Paris prosecutor Remi Heitz told reporters. 
A police source said the explosion tore apart a bakery on the rue Trevise and witnesses said the force of the blast shattered nearby storefronts and rocked buildings hundreds of meters away. 
More than 200 firefighters joined the rescue operation and two helicopters landed on the nearby Place de l'Opera to evacuate victims. Ambulances struggled to access the blast area because of police barriers set up to contain any violence by yellow vest protesters. 
An eyewitness at a hotel nearby said he saw flames envelop the ground floor of the building blown out by the blast.
""There was broken glass everywhere, storefronts were blown out and windows were shattered up to the third and fourth floors,"" said 38-year-old David Bangura.

He said that as he approached the scene, a woman was crying for help from the first floor of a building: ""Help us, help us, we have a child"".

The plotters of Monday's coup attempt were arrested or killed within hours of seizing the national radio station, but the move reflected growing frustration with a government weakened by Bongo's secretive medical leave in Morocco. 
In a decree read by the secretary-general of the presidency on national television early on Saturday morning, Bongo named Julien Nkoghe Bekale as prime minister, replacing Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet, who has served since 2016. 
Issoze-Ngondet's tenure was marked by a sharp drop in oil output and prices that has squeezed revenues, raised debt and stoked discontent in the OPEC member state.
Oil workers' strikes have become more common, and economic growth was 2 percent last year, down from over 7 percent in 2011. 
The nomination of Nkoghe Bekale, 56, who has held several ministerial posts since 2009, represents a return to a tradition begun by Bongo's father, Omar, of choosing prime ministers from the Fang, Gabon's largest ethnic group.
Omar Bongo ruled Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009, establishing the country as a pillar of ""Francafrique"", a web of influence that gave companies from former colonial power France favored access to African autocrats. 
The Bongos come from a smaller ethnic group, and the appointments were a way of broadening the president's base. But Ali Bongo, who succeeded his father when he died, bucked tradition in 2016 by choosing Issoze-Ngondet, who comes from a different ethnic group. 
Bongo's absence from Gabon since his Oct. 24 stroke in Saudi Arabia has raised questions about his ability to continue carrying out his official functions, although the government has insisted he is recovering well. 
A Dec. 31 address from Morocco in which the 59-year-old president slurred his speech and appeared unable to move his right arm failed to reassure many Gabonese and was cited as one of the coup plotters' reasons for acting. 
Bongo won re-election in 2016 by fewer than 6,000 votes amid widespread accusations of fraud, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched.

BANGKOK/TORONTO (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family saying she feared for her life has been granted asylum in Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, as Thai officials confirmed the teen was en route to Toronto.
Trudeau said United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had asked Canada to take in Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who grabbed international attention this week after she barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to resist being sent home to her family, which denies any abuse.
""Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women's rights around the world, and I can confirm that we have accepted the U.N.'s request,"" he told reporters.
The decision is likely to exacerbate Canada's already poor relations with Saudi Arabia, which last year barred the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh after Ottawa criticized Saudi authorities for detaining women's' activists.
Qunun arrived in Bangkok on Saturday and was initially denied entry, but she soon started posting messages on Twitter from the transit area of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport saying she had ""escaped Kuwait"" and her life would be in danger if forced to return to Saudi Arabia.
Following a 48-hour stand-off at Bangkok airport, some of it barricaded in a transit lounge hotel room, she was allowed to enter Thailand and was then processed as a refugee by the UNHCR.
The UNHCR welcomed Canada's decision and also acknowledged Thailand had given Qunun temporary refuge.
""Ms. al-Qunun's plight has captured the world's attention over the past few days, providing a glimpse into the precarious situation of millions of refugees worldwide,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. 
Qunun has accused her family of abuse, and has refused to meet her father and brother who arrived in Bangkok to try take her back to Saudi Arabia.
""It was her wish to go to Canada,"" Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told reporters. ""She still refuses to meet with her father and brother, and they are going to be traveling back tonight as well ... They are disappointed."" 
Her case has drawn global attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
A Korean Air flight carrying Qunun left Bangkok for Seoul on Friday night at 11:37 p.m. local time (1637 GMT), an airport official told Reuters. 
Qunun will board a connecting flight to Toronto from Seoul's Incheon airport. She is expected to arrive in Canada on Saturday morning. 
Trudeau brushed off a question as to whether Canada's move might make it harder to repair ties with Saudi Arabia.
""Canada has been unequivocal that we will always stand up for human rights and women's rights around the world,"" he said.
Amid increasing domestic political pressure, Trudeau said last month that his Liberal government was looking for a way out of a multibillion-dollar arms deal with Riyadh.
Qunun's flight has emerged at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen. 

Canada has repeatedly said Khashoggi's murder was unacceptable and demanded a full explanation.

QAMISHLI, Syria/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State added to confusion surrounding the U.S. withdrawal from Syria on Friday by saying it had started the pullout process, but officials later clarified that only equipment, not troops, were being withdrawn.
President Donald Trump's announcement last month that he had decided to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops there stunned allies who have joined Washington in the battle against Islamic State militants in Syria.
Senior U.S. officials were shocked too, among them Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who quit in protest.
U.S. Colonel Sean Ryan, a coalition spokesman, said the coalition ""has begun the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria.""
""Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troop movements,"" Ryan said.
After media reports suggesting the departure of U.S. forces had begun, the Pentagon later said no troops had yet withdrawn and stressed that the battle against Islamic State was continuing as U.S.-backed forces try to capture the group's last remaining pockets of territory in Syria. 
""We will confirm that there has been no redeployment of military personnel from Syria to date,"" said Navy Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that equipment was being moved out of Syria, a sign that despite mixed messages from Washington preparations for a withdrawal of troops was proceeding apace.
Robertson, in his statement, said the coalition had carried out ""logistical measures"" to support a withdrawal but did not enter into details. 
""The withdrawal is based on operational conditions on the ground, including conversation with our allies and partners, and is not be subject to an arbitrary timeline,"" he said.
Residents near border crossings that are typically used by U.S. forces going in and out of Syria from Iraq said they had seen no obvious or large-scale movement of U.S. ground forces on Friday.
Separately, Syrian state news agency SANA said Israeli warplanes fired a number of missiles toward the Damascus area on Friday, triggering Syrian air defenses that shot down most of them.
""The results of the aggression so far were limited to a strike on one of the warehouses at Damascus airport,"" SANA quoted a military source as saying.
SYRIA UPHEAVAL
The U.S. decision has injected new uncertainty into the eight-year-long Syrian war and spurred a flurry of contacts over how a resulting security vacuum will be filled across a swathe of northern and eastern Syria where the U.S. forces are stationed.
On the one hand, Turkey aims to pursue a campaign against Kurdish forces that have allied with the United States, and on the other the Russia- and Iran-backed Syrian government sees the chance to recover a huge chunk of territory.
U.S. national security adviser John Bolton suggested on Tuesday that protecting Washington's Kurdish allies would be a precondition of the U.S. withdrawal. That drew a rebuke from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan who called his comments ""a serious mistake"".
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been touring the Middle East this week to reassure allies of Washington's commitment to regional security, said on Thursday the withdrawal would not be scuppered despite the Turkish threats.
The Kurdish groups that control the north have turned to Moscow and Damascus in the hope of striking a political deal that will stave off Turkey and shield their autonomy in the north.
Russia, which has deployed forces into Syria in support of the Damascus government, said it had the impression that the United States wanted to stay despite the announced withdrawal of U.S. troops, RIA news agency reported.
RUSSIA URGES DAMASCUS-KURDISH DIALOGUE
Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said it was important for Syrian Kurds and the Syrian government to start talking to each other in light of the U.S. withdrawal plans.
She also said the territory previously controlled by the United States should be transferred to the Syrian government.
""In this regard, establishing dialogue between the Kurds and Damascus takes on particular significance. After all, the Kurds are an integral part of Syrian society,"" Zakharova said. 
Turkey views the U.S.-backed YPG Syrian Kurdish militia as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights, mostly in southeastern areas near Syria.
A Kurdish politician told Reuters last week the Kurds had presented Moscow with a road-map for a deal with Damascus. Syria's deputy foreign minister said on Wednesday he was optimistic about renewed dialogue with the Kurds.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian of France, which is part of the U.S.-led coalition, welcomed what he believed was a slower withdrawal by the United States after pressure from its allies.
""President Macron spoke to him (Trump) several times and it seems that there has been a change that I think is positive,"" he said in a television interview on Thursday.

In a rare acknowledgment that French troops were also in Syria, he said they would leave when there is a political solution in the country.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>",Mexico City pipeline hit by 'sabotage' amid crackdown on fuel theft,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A major fuel pipeline that supplies Mexico City remained closed after two ruptures in a single day, the president said on Friday, as the government works to stem shortages that have frustrated motorists and triggered economic risks. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's offensive against fuel robbers marks the leftist's first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1.
Criminal groups have tapped pipelines and stolen tanker trucks carrying diesel and gasoline in the oil-producing country for years, costing the government billions of dollars.
The government will assign 8,300 police and 1,400 security vehicles over the next 48 hours to safeguard fuel trucks so they can deliver to gas stations, said Mexico's National Chamber of Freight Transport (CANACAR).
A key pipeline running from the port of Tuxpan in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz to Mexico City was shut down on Thursday night and repairs were underway, Lopez Obrador said on Friday. 
The pipeline was hit at daybreak on Thursday and repaired, only to suffer another rupture at 11 p.m., he said. 
""There's sabotage,"" he said. ""Let's see who gets tired first."" 
The series of disruptions to the pipeline in recent days had caused shortfalls in supply for Mexico City and surrounding states.
Cars lined up by the dozen at stations throughout the capital on Friday, many before dawn, fearing that the shortages that fanned into the megacity this week from nearby states could persist. 
Local television showed angry protesters blocking a major roadway in Mexico City's Iztapalapa neighborhood.
The head of Mexico's central bank said on Thursday that the economy and inflation rate could be negatively affected if fuel distribution problems persist.
The closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato last weekend cut off supply for numerous gas stations. 
Lopez Obrador later said the military had discovered a 3-km (1.9 mile)-long ""hose"" that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks from the facility to a secret storage area. 
The president also confirmed some congestion at key ports where imported motor fuels arrive, noting that some tanker ships were awaiting to discharge cargos, but he did not provide details. 
Bottlenecks at Mexico's main Gulf coast and Pacific coast ports have increased during this week, and now prevent almost 10 million barrels of gasoline and diesel from discharging on schedule, further complicating distribution, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
On Tuesday, 24 vessels were backed up at ports, while that number has grown to 39 by Friday.

Six tankers loaded with liquefied petroleum gas, used mostly for heating, are also waiting to discharge.

(Reuters) - A 13-year-old girl's escape from a rural home where she was held captive for three months by a Wisconsin man charged with murdering her parents helped break the case and she should be treated as a hero, the local sheriff said on Friday.
Jayme Closs is with her aunt after her rescue on Thursday and has been reunited with the rest of her family and her dog, Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald told reporters.
Thousands of volunteers and hundreds of law enforcement officers had searched the small town of Barron after Closs' parents were found shot dead in their home in October, their front door blown open with a shotgun, their daughter gone.
Closs was targeted by suspected kidnapper Jake Patterson, 21, who carefully planned her parents' murder, even shaving his head to avoid leaving forensic evidence at the crime scene, Fitzgerald told reporters.
""Jayme was the target,"" said Fitzgerald. ""The suspect had specific intentions to kidnap Jayme and went to great lengths to prepare to take her.""
Relying on what Fitzgerald called ""the will of a kid to survive,"" a disheveled Closs escaped the house in the tiny town of Gordon where she had been held captive, about 60 miles (100 km) north of her home in Barron. Her captor was not at home when she managed to flee, Fitzgerald said. She was found by a woman walking her dog on Thursday afternoon.
""Jayme is the hero in this case. She's the one who helped us break this case,"" Fitzgerald told reporters.
Closs spoke to investigators on Friday after spending a night in the hospital for evaluation. Authorities did not offer any details about the conditions of her captivity or how she had managed to escape.
'LOOKING FOR HER'
Less than 15 minutes after Closs' rescue, Patterson was taken into custody after police pulled him over, based on Closs' description of his vehicle.
""The suspect was out looking for her when law enforcement made contact with him,"" Fitzgerald told a news conference, adding police were not seeking any other suspects in the case at this time. 
Police are now trying to work out why Patterson targeted Closs.
""We don't believe there was a social media connection and are determining how he became aware of Jayme,"" Fitzgerald said. ""Nothing in this case shows the suspect knew anyone at the Closs home, or at any time had contact with anyone in the Closs family.""
Patterson, an unemployed resident of Gordon, was charged on Friday with kidnapping and with murdering James and Denise Closs with a shotgun. Their bodies were discovered on Oct. 15.
He was being held in the Barron County jail, and it was not yet clear whether he had a lawyer. He faces an initial court hearing on Monday.
Authorities have released few details about Patterson, who has no previous criminal record in Wisconsin. 
Fitzgerald, the Barron County Sheriff, said Patterson grew up in Gordon and attended high school in the area. 
The president of the Jennie-O Turkey store in Barron, where James and Denise Closs had worked for decades, said Patterson had been an employee there for a single day three years ago. He quit the next day, saying he was moving, Steve Lykken said.
""We are still mourning the loss of longtime Jennie-O family members Jim and Denise, but our entire team is celebrating with the community, and the world, that Jayme has been found,"" Lykken said.
The superintendent of the local school district, Jean Serum, described Patterson as a nice kid and member of his high school's quiz bowl team. He graduated in 2015.
INNER STRENGTH
About 350 people under the age of 21 are kidnapped by strangers in the United States each year, according to FBI data.
Those that survive months in captivity need inner strength and a great deal of luck, according to survivors and experts who have worked with such victims.
Elizabeth Smart, who was held captive for nine months as a teenager after her 2002 abduction in Utah, posted a photo of Closs on Instagram, praising the ""miracle"" that she had been found.

""No matter what may unfold in her story let's all try to remember that this young woman has SURVIVED and whatever other details may surface the most important will still remain that she is alive,"" Smart wrote.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court on Friday rejected the appeal of two Reuters reporters sentenced to seven years in jail on charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act, saying the defense had not provided sufficient evidence to show they were innocent.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted by a lower court in September in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress toward democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
(Follow latest updates on detained reporters https://www.reuters.com/subjects/myanmar-reporters)
""It was a suitable punishment,"" said High Court Judge Aung Naing, referring to the seven-year prison term meted out by the lower court.
The defense has the option of making a further appeal to the country's supreme court, based in the capital Naypyitaw.
""Today's ruling is yet another injustice among many inflicted upon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. They remain behind bars for one reason: those in power sought to silence the truth,"" Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement.
""Reporting is not a crime, and until Myanmar rights this terrible wrong, the press in Myanmar is not free, and Myanmar's commitment to rule of law and democracy remains in doubt.""
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a message on Twitter that the decision was deeply troubling and showed Myanmar's courts ""failing a basic test in democracy.""
""In the name of free & independent press, the gov't of Burma should release these journalists immediately. The world is watching,"" Pence added.
In their appeal arguments last month, defense lawyers had cited evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. They asserted the lower court that tried the case had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the defendants.
The defense also said prosecutors had failed to prove the reporters gathered and collected secret information, sent information to an enemy of Myanmar or that they had an intention to harm national security.
Explaining his verdict, Judge Aung Naing said the reporters had behaved in a way that showed they intended to harm the country.
The judge cited meetings between reporter Wa Lone and members of the security forces as well as a notebook found at the journalist's house that contained the phone number of a member of the Arakan Army, an armed ethnic rebel group he had reported on while covering peace negotiations several years ago.
Wa Lone had testified during the trial that the phone number did not work and he did not have contact with the rebel group.
""Action can be taken against them if, judging by their behavior and characteristics, it appears they will harm the national security and interests of the country,"" said Aung Naing.
He said the defense had failed to prove the arrests were a set-up by authorities.
""I lost all my hope,"" a weeping Chit Su Win, the wife of reporter Kyaw Soe Oo, said after the verdict.
PERSONAL INTEREST
Britain called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to look at whether due process was followed. 
Asked about the case by BBC radio, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, to ""recognize that, as someone who fought for democracy in Burma, she should be taking a personal interest in the future of these two brave journalists.""
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not available for comment. 
Standing outside the court building in Yangon where the judgment was pronounced, Kristian Schmidt, the European Union ambassador to Myanmar, said the ruling was a ""miscarriage of justice and it gives us great concern for the independence of the justice system of Myanmar"".
Defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung, speaking after the ruling, said his team would discuss the option of a supreme court appeal with the two reporters. ""We are very disappointed with the judgment,"" he said.
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar's Rakhine State during an army crackdown that began in August 2017. 

The operation sent more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, according to United Nations' estimates.

NEW YORK/TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A massive winter storm hit the U.S. Rockies and Plains on Friday then punched east, with snow set to assault a 1,800-mile (1,609 km) corridor through the weekend, creating transportation ""havoc"" in the middle of the country.
The system started as rain from Mexico and turned to snow as it met icy air. Up to 18 inches (45 cm) of snow were expected in the Sangre de Cristo mountains south of Denver, according to the National Weather Service.
As the storm heads east, up to 16 inches (41 cm) of snow were likely in western Missouri and St. Louis. Areas to the east could get about 6 inches (15 cm) with ice developing in Kansas, and Arkansas, and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of snow in Washington, D.C., before the system heads out to sea late on Sunday, AccuWeather said.
""The storm is expected to create havoc over the central part of the country, then extend eastward into the Mid-Atlantic states,"" said Randy Adkins, an AccuWeather meteorologist. 
The FlightAware.com flight tracking website reported 1,431 flight cancellations on Friday and 12,465 delays, with problems at snow-hit airports like Denver causing knock-on effects around the country. 
While the storm will spare the heavily populated Northeast, it likely will disrupt air and auto travel from Kansas City to Indianapolis, and will bring the heaviest snowfall so far this winter to Cincinnati and the Ohio River Valley, said AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Walker.
Although the Kansas City area is expected to get up to 6 inches of snow, it should be over by the time the Kansas City Chiefs begin their National Football League playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday afternoon.
St. Louis emergency management officials are bracing for auto travel disruptions and possible power outages, but based on current forecasts, are not expecting to be overwhelmed, spokeswoman Tracy Panus said.
""This is not the first storm we’ve had in the St. Louis area,"" Panus, who is with the St. Louis County Police Department of Emergency Management, said by telephone. 
As the system moves eastward, it will hand off to a second coastal storm on Sunday that will bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of snow to the Washington, D.C., area before it moves off the coast that night, Walker said.
""There could be a period of ice that we’re concerned about across portions of central North Carolina and back into the mountains,"" he added.

""The results of the aggression so far were limited to a strike on one of the warehouses at Damascus airport,"" the SANA news agency cited a military source as saying. The attack took place at 11:15 p.m.(2115 GMT), it said.
Syrian state media broadcast footage of what it said were the air defenses firing, with bright lights seen shooting across the night sky. Explosions were heard in one of the videos.
Israel has mounted attacks in Syria as part of its effort to counter the influence carved out there by Iran, which has supported President Bashar al-Assad in the war that erupted in 2011.
The last Israeli attack reported by Syrian state media was on Dec. 25, when a missile attack wounded three Syrian soldiers.
A senior Israeli official said in September Israel had carried out more than 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years.
Iranian and Iran-backed groups including Lebanon's Hezbollah have deployed into Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad's government during the war.

The meeting will take place in Warsaw on Feb. 13-14, it said in a statement.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed the planned event as a ""desperate anti-Iran circus.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News in an interview to air on Friday that the meeting would ""focus on Middle East stability and peace and freedom and security here in this region, and that includes an important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilizing influence.""
Pompeo, who is on an eight-day visit to the Middle East, said the meeting would ""bring together dozens of countries from all around the world, from Asia, from Africa, from Western Hemisphere countries, Europe too, the Middle East of course.""
Pompeo has said during the tour that the United States is ""redoubling"" its efforts to put pressure on Iran and sought to convince allies that it is committed to fighting Islamic State despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.
Trump last year withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord and moved to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Other partners in the deal - including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - have sought to keep the agreement from unraveling, although in a shift earlier this week, the European Union moved to impose some sanctions on Iran.
Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said in a statement that while his country supported the EU's efforts to maintain the nuclear deal, the agreement ""does not stop Iran from activities destabilizing the region"" and he hoped the conference would bring closer the EU and U.S. positions.
He said more than 70 countries were invited to the conference, including all EU members.
Writing on Twitter, Iran's Zarif said, ""Reminder to host/participants of anti-Iran conference: those who attended last U.S. anti-Iran show are either dead, disgraced, or marginalized. And Iran is stronger than ever.""
He went on to write that ""while Iran saved Poles in WWII, it now hosts desperate anti-Iran circus.""
The U.S. State Department said there were strong shared interests in Middle East stability.
""The ministerial will address a range of critical issues including terrorism and extremism, missile development and proliferation, maritime trade and security, and threats posed by proxy groups across the region,"" its statement said. 

On his Middle East tour, Pompeo is trying to shore up support in the region on a number of fronts, from the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria to the rift between Saudi Arabia and Qatar to the killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition-led congress is considering offering legal incentives to military officers who disavow President Nicolas Maduro and help lead a transition to a new government, according to four legislators and a draft document seen by Reuters.
Maduro was sworn in on Thursday for a second term following a disputed 2018 election, triggering a hailstorm of international criticism that his leadership of the country suffering a hyperinflationary collapse is illegitimate.
The proposal, which comes in part at the request of high-ranking officers on active duty, seeks to ensure that defectors from the armed forces would not be persecuted by a future government if they abandon Maduro, according to the legislators, who asked not to be identified.
It would apply to officers who ""do not obey the orders of the man who has usurped the Presidency of the Republic ... and collaborate with the tradition and re-establishment of constitutional order,"" the draft says.
The plan shows the opposition increasingly focused on the military as crucial in removing the ruling Socialist Party from power. But the law will almost certainly be thrown out by the pro-Maduro Supreme Court, meaning its legal impact would remain symbolic as long as Maduro is in office.
Opposition leaders have faced significant hurdles in recruiting military dissidents due to Maduro's continued sway over the armed forces and a crackdown on accused insurgents that human rights groups have said includes torture of officers and abuse of their families.
Plans to offer incentives to officers as a way of hastening Maduro's departure has not been previously reported.
Opposition leaders have publicly discussed creating a transition plan, as well as amnesty for military officers who are already in jail on accusations of conspiring against Maduro - many of whom the opposition considers political prisoners.
Congress plans to vote on the 17-page draft document entitled ""Law Governing the Transition to Democracy"" in the coming weeks, the legislators said.
The draft does not detail what the incentives would be or under what conditions they would be offered, which would be approved in a separate law, they said. 
The overall transition law is in principle supported by major opposition leaders including Popular Will, First Justice, and Democratic Action, the lawmakers said. 
Spokespeople for the three parties did not respond to requests for comment.
The Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
Human Rights Watch and local rights group Penal Forum found 32 cases in which military officers accusing of plotting against Maduro's government were subjected to beatings, asphyxiation and electric shocks.
Internal military documents reviewed by Reuters in 2018 showed that the number of soldiers detained for treason, rebellion and desertion rose to 172 in the first four months of that year, up three-and-a-half times on the same period of 2017.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia's parliament passed an amendment to the constitution on Friday to rename the country Republic of North Macedonia, in line with an agreement with Greece to put an end to a 27-year-old dispute.
The countries struck the deal on the new name in June, but Macedonia will start using it only after the parliament in Athens also ratifies the agreement.
Eighty-one deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favor. Representatives of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE, who opposed the agreement with Greece, boycotted the vote.
""A new historical chapter in our statehood has been written this evening,"" the Macedonian government said in a statement.
""It makes absolutely plausible two of our biggest state interests - membership in NATO and EU,"" it said. 
Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras called his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev to congratulate him, his office said in a written statement. 
Greece blocked its neighbor's aspirations to EU and NATO membership over the use of 'Macedonia', which it said implied territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.
The implementation of the agreement, named after the bordering town of Prespa where it was signed, is intended to end the dispute. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and EU commissioner in charge of enlargement Johannes Hahn hailed the vote. 
""NATO strongly supports the full implementation of the agreement, which is an important contribution to a stable and prosperous region,"" Stoltenberg wrote on his twitter account. 
""My sincerest congratulations to political actors and citizens of the hopefully soon to be North Macedonia on Parliament’s vote on the constitutional changes,"" Hahn tweeted. 
""(I) hope that this historic decision creates a positive dynamic for reconciliation in the whole Western Balkan region,"" Hahn said.
Several hundred people have protested against the deal in front of parliament over the past three days. Macedonian opposition parties and nationalists say changing the name of the country and national symbols is too high price to pay for NATO accession.
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party has asked for an early election. 

""The vote on constitutional amendments that changed the name, identity, history and culture was done against the constitution. It was illegal, violent and done in a criminal way,"" Hristijan Mickoski told journalists after the vote.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",Brits to vote again? Brexit delay creates headache for Europe,"By Francesco Guarascio and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit paralysis has prompted talk of a British election or a second referendum but one odd side-effect could be Britons having to cast their votes for an EU parliament they had decided to leave.
Britain is scheduled to quit the European Union on March 29, two months before citizens of the other 27 EU states elect a new European Parliament. 
But with Prime Minister Theresa May looking unlikely to win British parliamentary backing next week for her EU withdrawal treaty, speculation is mounting that London will try to delay departure, creating a legal headache for Brussels.
""We are looking into what this might mean, but there is very little that is clear, legally, and it depends on what Britain decides to do,"" one senior EU official said, describing growing discussion of the issue around Brussels and in EU member states.
Key complications are: 
- how long an extension Britain may seek to its two-year exit deadline under Article 50 of the EU treaty -- notably whether it leaves before or after the current EU legislature lapses on July 1
- whether an extension might end up cancelling Brexit altogether
- whether a need for Britons to vote for new EU representatives could be delayed beyond May
- whether the new EU chamber will need to ratify the Brexit terms.
""It's being discussed informally. There's not been any formal proposal and indeed a proposal would have to be kicked off by the UK government, at some juncture,"" said Richard Corbett, a leading British Labour Member of the European Parliament (MEP).
A European affairs minister from an EU government said the prospect of Britons having to hold a vote in late May to elect MEPs to a chamber they were still about to leave would be ""mad politically, but legally we might have no other option"".
A second EU official said Britain had told the EU it had budgeted for an election that, without Brexit, would have been scheduled for Thursday, May 23.
Asked about such plans, Britain's Electoral Commission said it had no plan for an election but it was ""experienced in delivering well run, unscheduled elections and can draw upon this expertise as required"".
SCENARIOS
There are several scenarios for how a delay to Brexit could play into the EU elections, which are shaping into a showdown between eurosceptic nationalists and more mainstream parties:
- An extension of Britain's EU membership of six weeks or so to allow for loose ends to be tidied up if May eventually wins parliamentary backing. That would have little impact as Britain would be out before European Parliament elections.
- An extension of three months to end-June could also have limited impact, as the existing EU parliament would be within its five-year mandate and could ratify the Brexit treaty.
- From July 2, any EU decision must be ratified by the new parliament elected on May 23-26. If Britain is still formally a member and has not returned its MEPs, there could be legal challenges to the validity of any agreement.
- That could strengthen arguments for Britons to go to the polls anyway on May 23 to elect MEPs -- though there could then be questions over the role of those MEPs in any vote on Brexit.
- Britain could hold a ""catch up"" election for MEPs later, if for example if it used the extension to hold a second referendum that might revoke the Article 50 notification and scrap Brexit.
- Some officials also note a mechanism whereby new member states send representatives from their national parliament to the EU legislature until they have held a direct EU election; but applying that to an existing member state is problematic.
- Adding to the problems, the EU already handed some of Britain's seat allocation to other countries -- but that change will be put on hold until after Brexit, leaving some states such as France unsure how many MEPs they may actually be electing.
The confusion could have a serious impact on EU business by delaying a timetable for choosing a new EU executive and setting a new legislative program, including a new seven-year budget. 

Officials say President Jean-Claude Juncker and his European Commission expect to have to stay in office beyond their end-October mandate even if Brexit goes smoothly, due to likely wrangling with eurosceptics in the new parliament and among national leaders over who should replace Juncker and his team.

Ashraf Al-Qidra, spokesman for the Gaza health ministry, said 25 other Palestinians were wounded by Israeli gunfire during the mass demonstration, a weekly event along the border since March 30.
An Israeli military spokesman said troops had faced off with around 13,000 Palestinians, some of whom threw rocks and grenades across the fenced-off border. On three occasions, Palestinians crossed into Israel before doubling back, he said.
Gaza's health ministry, run by the Islamist militant group Hamas, says more than 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the protests, billed as pressing for an end to a grinding Israeli-led blockade of the enclave.
The 44-year-old woman killed on Friday was shot in the head, Gaza medics said.
Palestinians also want a right of return to lands from which their families fled or were forced to flee in the 1948 war of Israel's founding. 
Israel says the protests are organized by Hamas to distract from its governance problems and provide cover for cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this.
On Friday, two senior Egyptian security officials left the territory after meeting with officials from Hamas and other factions. Participants said they discussed Cairo-led efforts to reconcile Hamas with the rival Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and reduce border tensions.
A Palestinian official said Egypt's message was that Israel sought no escalation.
""Factions here are also committed to calm as long as the Israeli occupation abides by it,"" the official told Reuters.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Abbas has a measure of control, the army said troops shot a Palestinian who attempted to carry out a stabbing attack near a Jewish settlement. The Palestinian was detained and taken for medical treatment.

Hamed will be released conditionally on January 19, when he fulfils two-thirds of his sentence, the earliest possible date set in his sentence, court spokesman Laszlo Soros told Reuters.
Soros said Hamed would be expelled, without giving further details.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's hardline anti-immigration stance has put Hungary at odds with fellow EU members Germany and France. As well as building a steel fence on its southern border to keep out migrants, Hungary toughened its immigration laws and clamped down on non-government organizations working with migrants.
Hamed's case featured in a report on the rule of law in Hungary, which culminated last year in an unprecedented decision by the European Parliament to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption.
Orban said on Thursday that the views of France and Germany on immigration were irreconcilable with his own, and outlined a campaign to change Europe's political makeup along the migration issue.

The CDU said on Thursday that Merz, a former Merkel rival, would take a party post focusing on economic policy and transatlantic ties. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Merkel protege who beat Merz, congratulated him on his new CDU role on Twitter.
But Merz said he did not commit to any party role despite offering to help Kramp-Karrenbauer craft a new vision for the CDU, which wants to win back voters this year in regional elections in three eastern states where the far-right is strong.
""I am ready to help but I won't be part of any commission or any committee of the party,"" Merz told the n-tv broadcaster at an economic summit in Bavaria.
Asked about the apparent turnaround, a CDU spokeswoman said Merz's comments were no sign of a rift between Kramp-Karrenbauer and the man she narrowly defeated in December.
Both Kramp-Karrenbauer and Merz vowed to heal divisions within the CDU exposed by the race to succeed Merkel, who relinquished leadership of the party after the CDU hemorrhaged support in a regional election in October.

Merz is popular with members of the CDU's right wing who had wanted him to steer them away from Merkel's centrist path, which they blame for bleeding support to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>","German hacker spread right-wing, anti-Muslim views on Internet","BERLIN (Reuters) - A 20-year-old student who disclosed the private data of nearly 1,000 politicians and others in one of Germany's biggest data breaches had expressed rightwing and anti-Muslim views on the Internet, German media reported on Friday.
Using the Internet handle ""r00taccess"", the student, identified as Johannes S., said ""Islam is filth: we don't live in the 6th century"" and discussed the return of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party, weekly news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
German officials this week said the student, who lived with his parents in the central state of Hesse, had confessed to the breach.
They said he had described himself as frustrated about the utterances of politicians, but right-wing material was not initially found in a search of his home.
However investigators have now found that he engaged in repeated right-wing posts on the Internet and was part of a right-leaning community of ""hack-tivists"", Spiegel reported.
No comment was immediately available from the German interior ministry. The Frankfurt prosecutor's office, which is handling the case, could not be reached.
Spiegel said the suspect claimed in another posting that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would not be able to rid Germany of migrants, and it would take the ultranationalist National Democratic Party (NPD) ""to clean up properly.""
Germany's Constitutional Court in 2017 ruled that the NPD resembled Hitler's Nazi party, but ruled against banning it because it was too weak to endanger democracy.
Spiegel said authorities had opened three investigations of the student in recent years on suspicion that he was trying to illegally obtain data and falsify evidence, cases that were still pending in the courts.
A 19-year-old witness interviewed in the case, Jan Schuerlein, told broadcaster ARD that he helped lead authorities to the suspect because he had posted on the Internet about an earlier police raid. By pinpointing the date, authorities were able to identify the suspect.
""He is definitely a little oriented to the right, but not right-wing extremist,"" Schuerlein told ARD. ""But he had a big problem with the migrants and migrant policy."" 
Schuerlein said the suspect also had a negative view of Islam and ""viewed all Muslims as terrorists.""

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Congo election runner-up to press fraud dispute in court,"By Stanis Bujakera
KINSHASA (Reuters) - The runner-up in Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential election said on Friday he in fact won a landslide victory with more than 60 percent of votes and will file a formal fraud complaint in hours.
The vote was intended as Congo's first democratic transfer of power in six decades, but instead threatens to reawaken violence in the huge and tumultuous nation where millions have died during civil wars since the 1990s. 
""When you know you are in the right, you are not allowed to remain home,"" Martin Fayulu said, urging supporters to ""rise up"" and contest the results with him.
Though pre-election polls predicted a landslide for Fayulu, a businessman and former manager at  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), the national election board (CENI) said he lost to another opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi, 55.
Fayulu's camp said on Friday its tally showed he won 62 percent of votes, to Tshisekedi's 19 percent.
His supporters believe authorities rigged the result in a deal to protect members of President Joseph Kabila's outgoing administration and maintain his influence over security forces. 
The influential Catholic Church has also rejected the official result based on tallies by its bishops conference's (CENCO) 40,000-strong observer mission. France and former colonial power Belgium also expressed doubts.
In comments to the U.N. Security Council via teleconference on Friday, CENI president Corneille Nangaa defended the vote's credibility and attacked CENCO.
""I'd be very interested to know what party they work for,"" said Nangaa. ""I challenge anyone to say they have the pretension to have collected all the vote tallies.""
CENCO president Marcel Utembi, at the same table as Nangaa at U.N. headquarters in Kinshasa, told the Security Council the mission was independent and its conclusions were based on tally sheets representing 72 percent of ballots.
CENCO has not stated publicly who it believes won the election, but three diplomats briefed on its findings told Reuters it had determined Fayulu was the clear winner.
The head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, Leila Zerrougui, said preliminary reports from her mission and other observers all indicated the vote ""happened satisfactorily despite the technical, logistical and security problem"". 
Yet internal U.N. reports seen by Reuters noted allegations of irregularities across the country, including militia fighters reportedly forcing voters to select candidates from the ruling coalition. Another domestic observer mission said it witnessed vote tampering and other ""major"" irregularities. 
VIOLENCE FEARED
Fayulu's camp said it would raise these issues with Congo's highest court on Saturday morning. It has asked the election board to publish results from every polling station. 
""We know the Constitutional Court is composed by Kabila's people, but we do not want to give any chance to Kabila and his team to say...you didn't follow the law,"" Fayulu, 62, told the BBC.
Many Congolese fear the dispute could re-start a cycle of unrest in a country where wars causing hunger and disease have decimated the population in recent decades.
Around the nation of 80 million people that is nearly the size of western Europe, there have been isolated incidents of post-election violence. 
Police confronted protesters in eastern Goma city on Friday, killing at least one person, a Reuters witness said.
In the northern city of Kisangani, police and army responded to student protests, and in nearby Mangobo a local ruling party office was set on fire, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters. 
These incidents followed clashes on Thursday in Kikwit in which security forces killed four protesters. 
""This country has already suffered a lot from all this violence,"" said Kinshasa motorbike taxi driver Lambert, who declined to give his full name. ""These protests should not be happening because Tshisekedi is the people's choice.""
The officially-declared winner shot to prominence when he inherited the UDPS party leadership after the 2017 death of his father Etienne Tshisekedi. 
His genial manner and portly resemblance to his father have won him support. But he lacks the experience, clout and firebrand reputation of Etienne.
Before the vote, Tshisekedi said Kabila had nothing to fear should he win. Fayulu, by contrast, is backed by ex-rebel Jean-Pierre Bemba and former governor Moise Katumbi, both Kabila rivals.

""The people of the Democratic Republic of Congo have waited 58 years for a peaceful democratic transfer of power, and have sacrificed too much for this election result not to reflect their votes,"" said a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators.

PARIS (Reuters) - The president of Japan's Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, is under formal investigation in France for suspected corruption related to Japan's successful bid for the 2020 Olympic Games, a French judicial source said on Friday.
French financial prosecutors investigating a multi-million dollar payment made by Japan's bidding committee to a Singaporean consultancy questioned Takeda in Paris and he was placed under formal investigation on Dec. 10, the source told Reuters.
In Tokyo, Takeda said no improper actions such as bribery had taken place in connection with Tokyo's bid, and that he had not been charged by French authorities.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said its ethics committee has opened a file on the case and would meet on Friday, adding that Takeda ""continues to enjoy the full presumption of innocence.""
Under French law, a formal investigation means there is ""serious or consistent evidence"" implicating a suspect in a crime. It is one step closer to a trial, but such investigations can be dropped without going to court.
French investigators have led a years-long probe into corruption in athletics and in early 2016 extended their inquiry into the bidding and voting processes for the hosting of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
Prosecuting judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke now suspects Takeda - a former Olympic showjumper, longstanding Olympics official and second cousin of Emperor Akihito - of paying bribes to secure his nation's winning bid, the judicial source said.
Takeda, who also heads the IOC's marketing commission, apologized for ""the huge worries that have been brought to the people of Japan, who have given so much support to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics...""
""In order to put every doubt to rest I intend to continue cooperating with investigations,"" he said. 
QUESTIONED IN JAPAN IN 2017
The move against Takeda is linked to an investigation French prosecutors launched in 2016 into more than $2 million of payments by the Japanese bidding committee to consultancy firm Black Tidings, which was terminated in 2014.
In 2017, Takeda and several others were voluntarily questioned by Japanese prosecutors at the request of French authorities in relation to the payments, Kyodo News agency reported at the time. Takeda and the others had denied any wrongdoing, Kyodo said.
Japanese officials said at the time the two payments were legitimate consultancy fees. The first was made before Tokyo's win and the other after, as has been common practice.
A panel commissioned by the Japanese Olympic Committee said in September 2016 that it had found the payments to be legitimate.
Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said she was ""very surprised"" by the news of the investigation.
Takeda was placed under formal investigation on the same day Japanese authorities arrested now-ousted Renault-Nissan alliance chairman, Carlos Ghosn, on suspicion he under-reported his income at Nissan. Ghosn's detention shocked France, strained the car alliance and complicated bilateral relations. 
Asked about the timing, a source close to the French investigation into Takeda said there ""was no link between the two affairs"".
Takeda, 71, a great-grandchild of Emperor Meiji who competed in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, has been a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee since 1987 and its president since 2001.
He has helped coordinate preparations for several Winter Olympics as a senior member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Takeda attended a ceremony in Tokyo on Friday along with former prime minister Yoshiro Mori, the president of Tokyo 2020, according to Mori’s office.

The EU and Turkey struck an accord in 2016 after more than a million refugees and migrants arrived from the Middle East and Africa to Greece's shores the year before. 
Under the agreement, anyone crossing to Greece from Turkey who does not qualify for asylum must be sent back and for every Syrian refugee being returned to Turkey from the Greek islands, another will be resettled to the EU. 
""Unfortunately it's not working properly,"" Merkel said in response to questions from students at the German School of Athens. ""As it is not working, we have this pressurized situation on the Greek islands.""
Management of the refugee crisis has bruised unity in the 28-nation bloc: Mediterranean countries coping with most arrivals often feel helpless while wealthier northern nations complain people reach their soil unchecked and those on the EU's eastern flank refuse to host new arrivals.
Merkel concluded a two-day visit to Athens where she also met with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
""The Greek legal system is very complicated and somehow the sending back (of migrants) is not working,"" she told the students.
""Everyone knows once you're on a Greek island, you can get to the mainland, and once you're on the mainland you can then somehow get to Germany, Sweden, Austria or somewhere else, so then we are supporting illegal migration,"" she said. 
Merkel said she spoke to Tsipras about those issues. 

""There are many Iraqis, many Afghans and many others for whom we have no solution in the deal. Europe needs to take care of that too,"" she said. ""It's a bit complicated but in the long term it's not acceptable that some European countries say this problem doesn't interest us.""

LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - At least $14 billion is needed to accelerate the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and quell stubborn epidemics that still kill millions, the head of a global health fund said on Friday.
Announcing a fundraising target for the next three-year cycle, Peter Sands, director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said the money could help save 16 million lives, halving deaths from the three diseases.
It would also be used to build stronger health systems in poor countries ill-equipped to handle existing outbreaks and unable to cope with potential new epidemics.
""New threats mean there is no middle ground,"" Sands said in a statement. ""We need to ... protect and build on the gains we have made, or we will see those achievements eroded, infections and deaths resurge, and the prospect of ending the epidemics disappear.""
The Global Fund is a group of governments, civil society and private sector partners which invests around $4 billion a year to fight infectious diseases. It was launched in 2002 and has since helped slash the number of people dying from AIDS, TB and malaria by around a third. 
Yet the epidemics are still far from beaten. 
In 2017, TB killed 1.6 million people, including 300,000 people with HIV, making it one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Malaria kills almost half a million people each year, most of them babies or young children in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In the AIDS pandemic, almost 37 million people worldwide are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and around 15 million of them do not get the antiretroviral drugs needed.
Sands acknowledged in a telephone interview how hard it would be to encourage international donors to pledge funds towards such a high target. But he added that with the fund's reach and ability to elicit engagement and investment by governments in nations affected by the epidemics, he was confident it would have a major impact.

""If we step up the fight now, we will save millions more lives,"" he said.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 10:55AM ET</span>","With scant hope of success, Venezuelan opposition talks of removing Maduro","CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition-led Congress planned a public gathering on Friday to discuss ways to remove leftist President Nicolas Maduro, just a day after his swearing-in to a disputed second term, although the effort looked unlikely to succeed.
Maduro was re-elected in an election last year that was widely dismissed as fraudulent, and countries around the world called his continued leadership illegitimate. Ruling Socialist Party leaders have described the criticism as colonialist interference led by the United States.
The country's perennially fractured opposition has made numerous failed attempts over the past 20 years to remove the ruling socialists. 
The Supreme Court and an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly have stripped Congress of its powers, meaning it does not have the capacity to remove the president as would a legislature in many countries.
Nonetheless, the opposition has promised to keep up pressure.
""The transition has begun,"" Juan Guaido, head of the opposition-run legislature, via Twitter on Friday.
""Nicolas Maduro is totally illegitimate!""
On Thursday, Guaido called on the country's military to step forward and disavow Maduro. But Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and the country's top military commanders feted Maduro in a ceremony immediately after his swearing-in at which they pledged loyalty. 
Maduro's critics accuse him of creating a dictatorship and destroying the economy. Venezuela is experiencing the worst economic crisis in its history, with inflation headed toward 2 million percent and some three million people having left the country amid chronic shortages of basic food and medicines. 
Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by his political adversaries with the help of Washington.

Opposition efforts to remove Maduro have foundered. The pro-government elections council stymied a 2016 effort to trigger a recall referendum on the president's rule. More than 120 people were killed in four months of street protests in 2017 that eventually fizzled.

Conde's second and final term in office expires next year after a decade in power, but there is widespread speculation that he intends to try to amend the constitution to stay in office. Conde has refused to comment on the matter. 
In comments at a diplomatic ceremony broadcast on national television on Wednesday, Ambassador Alexander Bregadze lavished praise on the 80-year-old Conde, whom he called ""legendary"", and said that rotating leaders was not necessarily a good thing. 
""Constitutions are no dogma, Bible or Koran,"" he said. ""It's constitutions that adapt to reality, not realities that adapt to constitutions,"" Bregadze said.
""Guinea needs you today. And as the popular Russian saying goes, you don't change horses at a river crossing."" 
The remarks drew criticism from Guinean opposition leaders and media, who accused Bregadze of sullying Guinea's sovereignty, despite Russia's regular injunctions to Western powers to stay out of other countries' internal affairs. 
""We condemn this ... position taken by the Russian ambassador,"" Ousmane Gaoual Diallo, the spokesman for Guinea's main opposition party, the UFDG, told Reuters. ""Our constitution is clear about any third mandate and we will not accept an attempt to modify it.""
Kababachir.com, a website catering to Guinea's diaspora, went further in its criticism.
""By citing the Koran, the Bible, etc., this diplomat, the communication counselor of Alpha Conde, incarnates the spirit of evil,"" it said in a column. 
Russia has been ramping up its diplomatic and military influence across Africa in recent years and has a particular interest in Guinea as its biggest aluminum producer Rusal owns a major bauxite mine in the country. 
Conde's first election win in 2010 ended two years of military rule. His opponents say he has since cracked down on dissent, and frequent protests have broken out in the capital Conakry and bauxite mining hubs.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two political rivals in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh will form a alliance in a bid to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in national election scheduled for May, leaders of the parties said.
The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), both of whom command large support bases among Uttar Pradesh state's working class and are led by former chief ministers, will contest the election as a team, they said. 
Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and accounts for about a sixth of all members of the parliament. Barring a couple of exceptions in the 1990s, the party winning the most number of seats there has historically helped form the federal government.
It is not clear how the seats will be allotted and what role the main opposition Congress party will have in the state, but SP's chief Akhilesh Yadav hinted that it will not have a significant role to play.
Congress, which ruled India for nearly four decades since its independence from Britain in 1947, is working to build a so-called ""grand alliance"" with other parties in preparation for the vote.
""We can give Congress two seats they have always held,"" Yadav told news channel NDTV, referring to constituencies from where Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi have contested in the past.
An SP spokesperson declined to elaborate, and said further details will be revealed in a joint news conference by the SP and BSP on Saturday.
Opposition parties across the country received a fillip last month, when India's ruling party lost power in three states and dealt Prime Minister Narendra Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014.
The BJP, SP and BSP contested against each other during the state elections in March 2017, which the BJP comfortably won, but political analysts say an SP-BSP alliance could affect the ruling party's prospects.
The BJP had a 40 percent vote share in the state polls, the BSP and SP put together accounted for 44 percent. To be sure, voting patterns could be different when the world's largest democracy goes to polls. 
Despite recent setbacks, the BJP is confident of winning elections in Uttar Pradesh, its president Amit Shah said in a televised address.
""We will win 74 out of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.
Despite the strategic significance and having been ruled by different parties since independence, the state remains one of India's most backward.

It is notorious for its crime rate and unlicensed gun use, has below average literacy levels and an abysmally low human development index, in addition to worrying levels of population growth.

A majority of lawmakers approved the extension and rejected a motion by two far-left parties to end the scheme altogether. Such ""golden visa"" programs have faced criticism in Brussels for exposing the EU countries that operate them to corruption risks.
The ruling Socialists have given no indication that they intend to end the program, which has generated a steady inflow of funds, mainly into real estate, by non-EU investors notably from the Americas, China, Russia and Turkey.
Proposing scrapping it, Left Bloc lawmaker Jose Manuel Pureza called it ""just a tool for real estate speculation, corruption and money laundering.""
Lawmakers instead approved the addition of ""green visas.""
""Taking into consideration the importance of reinforcing a multicultural and open society ...it's important to create an additional scheme to attract foreign investment of an ecological nature,"" said Andre Silva, a lawmaker from the PAN animal-rights and environmental party. 
Under the extension, foreigners will qualify for Portuguese residency if they invest at least 500,000 euros ($575,000) in organic agriculture, ecotourism, renewable energy and other environmental projects that contribute to cut carbon emissions.
The existing scheme - which allows visa-free travel through Europe's Schengen area - offers residency for investments including property, setting up tech companies and creating jobs. 
Other EU countries including Spain, Malta, Greece and Cyprus run similar programs.
The European Commission is scheduled to publish a report offering guidance to member states on managing such programs, including background checks for applicants, on Jan. 23.

Anti-government protests first flared last month and have posed the most serious challenge yet to Bashir, a former army general who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes in the Darfur region.
In previous weeks, demonstrations have begun only after sundown and the number of people at this Friday's protests appeared smaller than in the past.
Reuters witnesses said security forces used tear gas against dozens of demonstrators in al-Halfaya Bahri in southern Khartoum and against a separate demonstration by dozens of people who had emerged from Sayed Abdel Rahman Mosque in Omdurman, on the other side of River Nile to the capital.
Security forces chased demonstrators into side streets but there were no immediate reports of casualties, they said.
In Omdurman, army forces on mini-trucks with automatic guns were seen guarding petrol station.
In a separate incident, witnesses said hundreds of demonstrators emerged from a mosque known to be affiliated to Bashir's government in Jabra neighborhood in southern Khartoum while chanting: ""The people want the fall of the regime.""
Footage posted on social media showed a stream of demonstrators pass by the mosque while chanting derogatory slogans against Bashir's Islamist-based administration. The authenticity of the recording could not immediately be verified.
North of Khartoum, witnesses said demonstrators blocked the main road linking the capital to the Red Sea city of Port Sudan, witnesses said, without giving any further details.
Since Dec. 19, Sudan has been rocked by almost daily protests sparked by rising food prices and cash shortages amid a deepening financial crisis. They have since turned against Bashir's nearly 30 years in office.
At least 22 people have been killed so far, including two security personnel, according to official figures. Hundreds have also been injured and hundreds more have been arrested.
Three demonstrators were killed during protests on Thursday and Amnesty International accused security forces of chasing injured victims into the Omdurman hospital.
Authorities said they had set up a commission to investigate the incident.
Sudan's economy was crippled when the south seceded in 2011, taking away much of its oil resources. The crisis has deepened since last year, when the country saw some brief protests over bread shortages.
The United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions on Sudan in October 2017. But many investors have continued to shun a country still listed by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Bashir came to power in a 1989 coup but became president winning successive elections that his critics say are neither fair nor free.

Lawmakers and campaigners in Portugal argued the law, which previously required prosecutors to show that an attack involved ""violence"", had failed to protect people attacked while they were unconscious or coerced into having sex against their will. 
The amendment aims to bring Portuguese legislation closer to the Istanbul Convention, an international treaty on preventing and combating violence against women.
The convention was ratified by the Portuguese government in 2012 and has been in force since 2014 but critics have argued authorities failed to fully incorporate it into law. 
In September last year, a court in Porto ruled that two men who had sex with an unconscious 26-year-old woman were not guilty of rape because the incident was a ""mutual seduction"".
Neighboring Spain saw protests last year over the case of a woman who was attacked by five men at the Pamplona bull running festival in 2016. The men, who filmed themselves cornering her in alley and having sex with her, were accused of gang rape but found guilty only of the lesser offense of sexual abuse, after judges ruled prosecutors could not prove the attack was violent.
""Crimes of sexual nature and rape (in Portugal) are based on the existence or non-existence of violence and we want it to be based on the existence or not of consent,"" Andre Silva, one of the lawmakers who proposed the amendment, told Portuguese radio station TSF. 
Article 36 of the Istanbul Convention states that authorities shall take all necessary measures to ensure that engaging in non-consensual sex is always treated as a crime. 
Portugal has followed in the footsteps of Belgium, Cyprus, Britain, Germany, Iceland, Ireland and Luxembourg which have all passed consent-based rape legislation.
According to Amnesty International, one EU woman in 10 experiences some form of sexual violence after the age of 15.
""Rape laws in place will not resolve everything but it is an important step towards changing attitudes and achieving justice, by making it clear that sex without consent is rape and it cannot continue with impunity,"" Amnesty said on its website.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>",Former Kosovo guerrillas to testify before Hague court,"By Fatos Bytyci
PRISTINA (Reuters) - A court examining war crimes against ethnic Serbs in Kosovo has asked several ex-commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to attend a preliminary hearing next week, part of a process that could help calm tensions between Belgrade and Pristina.
But the process also has the potential to trigger a political crisis in Kosovo, whose leaders are mostly ex-KLA commanders. Kosovars mostly view the former fighters as heroes for battling Serb forces in the 1998-99 independence war and fear they could be indicted.
The Specialist Chamber was set up in The Hague in 2015 to handle cases of alleged crimes by KLA guerrillas during the war that led to Kosovo's secession from Serbia. Kosovo's Western allies have insisted that Pristina cooperate with the court.
""I never went to Belgrade to fight but I did fight to protect my country,"" Sabahajdin Cena, one of the ex-KLA commanders asked to testify next week, told Reuters.
""This court is trying to equate the victim with the aggressor,"" said Cena, who will testify in Pristina. 
Ex-KLA commanders Sami Lushtaku and Rrustem Mustafa confirmed they would travel to The Hague to testify next week. Local Kosovo media said one veteran KLA fighter had gone into hiding when he received his invitation to attend.
""HUGE IMPACT""
Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci, Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj and parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli are all former KLA commanders and could potentially be indicted by the court or called as witnesses, Kosovo media have reported. 
A 2011 report that led to the creation of the court linked Thaci and some other leading Kosovo figures to gruesome wartime crimes against Serbs, including trade in organs harvested from prisoners of war. Thaci has denied any wrongdoing.
""Any eventual invitation to the main leaders will have a huge impact on the image of the country,"" said Imer Mushkolaj, a political analyst in Pristina.
It was not clear how many ex-fighters have been asked to testify in the first hearing and how many of them would travel to the Netherlands to do so.
The special prosecutor's office in The Hague, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment on this or future hearings or to say whether they might result in any indictments.
The office has the authority ""to request the presence of and to question suspects, victims and witnesses, if necessary summonsing these persons, collect and examine information and evidence"", spokesperson Christopher Bennett told Reuters.
As well as the killing of Serbs, the court will also investigate the killing of some Albanians who were seen as collaborating with the Serbian authorities at that time. 
The Specialist Chamber is governed by Kosovo law, but is staffed by international judges and prosecutors. It is funded by the European Union, which both Kosovo and Serbia hope to join.
The court sits in The Hague partly to help ensure protection of witnesses. Previous cases involving high-ranking former KLA officers have seen witness intimidation.
The KLA rose up against Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in the last 1990s, eventually winning crucial NATO air support that halted the killing and expulsion of Kosovo Albanian civilians during a brutal counter-insurgency campaign.
Kosovo, with a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority, declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and has been recognized by over 110 states, but not by five EU member states, Serbia or Russia.

Relations between Kosovo and Serbia remain tense, but the EU has told both countries they will not be allowed to join the bloc unless they normalize relations.

Bolton, in a radio interview, said he, President Donald Trump, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo understood Turkey had committed ""not to harm the Kurds who had fought with us against ISIS."" 
Bolton had suggested on Tuesday that protecting Washington's Kurdish allies would be a pre-condition of the U.S. withdrawal troops from Syria, which began earlier on Friday. That drew a rebuke from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who called his comments ""a serious mistake.""
""What we’re still pursuing in these military-to-military conversations are assurances and protocols and procedures so that everybody feels comfortable with how this is going to happen. And we’re hoping those discussions, which will continue next week, will produce results that are acceptable on both sides,"" he said in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, according to a transcript.
The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State began the process of withdrawing from Syria on Friday, making good on Trump's announcement that he had decided to remove 2,000 U.S. troops. Trump's decision stunned allies that have joined Washington in the battle against Islamic State, frequently called ISIS.

The U.S. decision has injected new uncertainties into the eight-year long Syrian war and a flurry of contacts over how a resulting security vacuum will be filled across a swathe of northern and eastern Syria where the U.S. forces are stationed. Turkey aims to pursue a campaign against Kurdish forces that have allied with the United States, and the Russia and Iran-backed Syrian government sees the chance to recover a huge chunk of territory.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 09:03AM ET</span>","Poland arrests Huawei employee, Polish man on spying allegations","By Joanna Plucinska, Karol Witenberg and Jack Stubbs
WARSAW/LONDON (Reuters) - Poland has arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei and a former Polish security official on spying allegations, officials and sources told Reuters on Friday, a move that could fuel Western security concerns about the telecoms equipment maker.
However, a spokesman for the Polish security services told Reuters the allegations related to individual actions, and were not linked directly to Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd [HWT.UL]. 
Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims, but the allegations have led several Western countries to restrict Huawei's access to their markets.
Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the Polish security services, said the country's Internal Security Agency (ISA) detained a Chinese citizen and a former Polish security official on Jan. 8 over spying allegations. The two men have heard charges and will be held for three months, he said.
""This matter has to do with his actions, it doesn’t have anything to do with the company he works for,"" Zaryn said of the Chinese man.
A person with knowledge of the matter said a Huawei employee called Wang Weijing had been arrested but not charged. 
A LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile for Wang showed he has worked for Huawei's Polish division since 2011 and previously served as attache to the Chinese General Consul in Gdansk from 2006-2011. Wang did not immediately respond to a request for comment via the social media site. 
Polish public TV channel TVP said the Polish man was a former ISA officer and that security services had searched the offices of his current employer, telecoms firm Orange Polska (WA:OPL) (PA:ORAN). Huawei's local offices were also searched, TVP reported. 
China's foreign ministry said it was ""greatly concerned"" by the reports, and urged Poland to handle the case ""justly.""
Huawei said in a statement it was aware of the situation but had no immediate comment.
""Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates, and we require every employee to abide by the laws and regulations in the countries where they are based,"" it said. 
Orange Polska said in a statement security services had on Tuesday gathered materials related to an employee, whom it did not identify. The company said it did not know if the investigation was linked to the employee's professional work, and that it would continue to cooperate with the authorities.
HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY
Huawei has come under intense scrutiny in recent months as countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan have followed U.S. moves against the company, citing security concerns.
Canadian authorities in December also arrested Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou at the behest of U.S. authorities as part of an investigation into alleged violations of U.S. trade sanctions, raising tensions with China at a time when Washington and Beijing are engaged in a broader trade war.
The West's security concerns surrounding Huawei, and fellow Chinese telecoms equipment firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), center around China’s National Intelligence Law. Approved in 2017, the law states that Chinese ""organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.""
This has sparked fears Huawei could be asked by the Chinese government to incorporate ""backdoors"" into their equipment that would allow Beijing access, for spying or sabotage purposes. Some experts also see a risk that Chinese intelligence may develop an ability to subvert Huawei's equipment.
Ewan Lawson, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the arrests in Poland could bolster Western concerns.
""It does point at the sort of connections that may exist between the state intelligence enterprise and private Chinese companies,"" he said. 
The European Commission is aware of the reports of the arrests and will reach out to the Polish authorities for further information, spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters in Brussels.

Norway said on Wednesday it was considering whether to join other Western nations in excluding Huawei from building part of the country's new 5G telecoms network.

British defense minister Gavin Williamson told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper last month that London was working on plans to build two new foreign bases ""within the next couple of years"" after it left the European Union.
Williamson did not specify where the bases might be built, but the newspaper reported that options included Singapore or Brunei near the South China Sea and Montserrat or Guyana in the Caribbean.
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, on Friday described Williamson's comments as baffling and warned such plans could destabilize world affairs.
""Of course, Britain like any other country is independent when it comes to its military construction plans.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Macron hopes debate can quell French unrest. So did Louis XVI,"By Emilie Delwarde and Richard Lough
PARIS/FLAGY, France (Reuters) - In 1789, Louis XVI summoned France's aristocracy, clergy and citizens to discuss ways to plug the crown's dismal finances and quell popular discontent over a sclerotic feudal society.
It marked the start of the French Revolution. Within months he was powerless and four years later beheaded by guillotine.
Two centuries on, President Emmanuel Macron, often criticized for a monarchical manner, is also calling a national debate to mollify ""yellow vest"" protesters whose nine week uprising has set Paris ablaze and shaken his administration.
He will launch the three-month ""grand debat"" initiative on Jan. 15. As during the rule of the ill-fated king, the French are already writing complaints in ""grievance books"" opened up by mayors of 5,000 communes.
The debate will focus on four themes -- taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship. Discussions will be held on the internet and in town halls. But officials have already said changing the course of Macron's reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy will be off limits.
""The debates are not an opportunity for people to offload all their frustrations, nor are we questioning what we've done in the past 18 months,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told BFM TV. ""We're not replaying the election.""
By limiting the terms, Macron risks making the same mistake that doomed the monarchy, historian Stephane Sirot of University of Cergy-Pontoise told Le Parisien newspaper.
""Emmanuel Macron is like Louis XVI who ... receives the grievance books but doesn't understand anything from them.""
DUST IN THE WIND
In Flagy, 100 kilometers south of Paris, the village mayor has been receiving written grievances from local ""yellow vests"" like Agosthino Bareto. The 65-year-old garage owner is convinced the government will frame the debate to suit itself.
""All that we've been saying is like dust thrown into the wind,"" Bareto said. ""We're not being listened to.""
Flagy's mayor, Jacques Drouhin, is sympathetic toward such frustrations. He says he will refuse to hold a town hall debate as long as Macron plans to press on with reforms regardless.
""That's not what our citizens are asking for,"" Drouhin said. ""That's enough. It's now down to our leaders to listen to what's been said in the grievance books.""
Weak participation would undermine the exercise. An Elabe opinion poll on Wednesday showed only 40 percent of citizens intend to take part in the debate.
France is bracing for more street protests and possible riots when winter sales kick off this Saturday. Yet even as the demonstrations rumble on, it remains unclear whether the ""yellow vests"" will emerge as a political force or fizzle away, undone by their own internal differences.
The leader of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, Luigi di Maio, this week publicly backed the French protesters, offering his party's internet platform for direct democracy -- known as ""Rousseau"" after a leading thinker of the French Enlightenment -- to help the ""yellow vests"" define a program.
While leaderless, the ""yellow vests"" mirror movements like Spain's Indignados and Italy's 5-Star, which have sought to upend Europe's traditional political system.
""I am more worried now about the 'yellow vest' protests in France (than Italy),"" Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, told an media briefing.
REFERENDUM?
The ""yellow vests"" take their name from the high-visibility jackets they wear at road barricades and on the street. Their rage stems from a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Macron, a former investment banker regarded as close to big business, is indifferent to their hardships.
Macron will take heart from a sharp fall in public support for the protesters over the past month. He promises to use the debates to channel their anger and shape new policy via a more participatory democracy.
The ""yellow vests"" are demanding the right to call referendums through mass petitions. Senior cabinet ministers have not rejected the idea -- Prime Minister Edouard Philippe called citizen-initiated referendums a ""useful tool in a democracy"" -- but said their use should be limited.
More likely is an idea touted within the ruling party and government for the national debate to be followed by a referendum with several questions, rather than a thumbs up or thumbs down vote. 

""The government is aware of the risks of making any vote a vote about Macron and not the issues,"" said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at risk advisory firm Teneo. ""So you solve that by asking multiple questions.""

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>","Near Syrian border, Turkish defense minister vows operation when time is right","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's defense minister on Friday pledged to wage a campaign against a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia, sharpening focus on a potential conflict the United States has sought to prevent. 
The comments from Hulusi Akar, on an unannounced visit to inspect troops stationed near the Syrian border directly opposite territory held by the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG, appeared to be aimed at both Washington and its Kurdish allies.
Turkey and the United States, although NATO allies, are deeply divided over the implementation of President Donald Trump's plan to bring home about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria. The plan hinges on Turkish cooperation to secure a swathe of northeast Syria as the United States departs.
While the pull-out has been clouded by mixed messages from both Trump and his administration, on Friday the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State began the process of withdrawing, a spokesman said.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, this week tried to make the case for guarantees that Turkey would not harm the YPG after the withdrawal. That earned a stiff rebuke from President Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization and sees Washington's support for it against Islamic State as a betrayal.
""When the time and place comes the terrorists here will be buried in the ditches they have dug, as was done in previous operations,"" Akar said in a speech to military personnel at a brigade command center in the province of Sanliurfa, referring to two other cross-border campaigns that Turkey has carried out in Syria.
Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. The Kurdish groups that control a vast swathe of northern Syria have now turned to Moscow and Damascus in the hope of striking a political deal that will stave off Turkey and shield their autonomy in the north. 
Ankara has repeatedly expressed frustration over a deal with the United States for the withdrawal of the YPG from the city of Manbij, just west of the Euphrates river.
""Before us we have Manbij on one side and the east of the Euphrates on the other,"" Akar said, underscoring the scale of a potential operation. ""Important preparations and planning have been made in connection with this. Our preparations are continuing intensively.""

Turkey's planned military operation against a Kurdish militia in Syria does not depend on an American withdrawal from the region, Ankara said on Thursday.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Under scrutiny during its first six-month EU presidency, Romania would be damaging rule of law should it decriminalize some forms of corruption and grant an amnesty to offenders, the head of the European Commission said on Friday. 
The leader of the ruling Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea, has a conviction for vote-rigging and has been pressing Romania's President Klaus Iohannis for the legal changes. 
But the head of the EU bloc's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, expressed disapproval of that at a joint news conference with Iohannis in Bucharest.
Even though the European Union was built on compromises, there could be no negotiating legal principles, he said.
""If an amnesty was adopted, as some in this country envisage, it would be a step back in the rule of law,"" Juncker said in response to a question.
Dragnea, who denies wrongdoing but is barred from becoming prime minister, has been pushing for changes including a decree that would grant prison pardons and amnesty, including for himself.
An attempt by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences at the start of 2017 triggered Romania's biggest street protests since the 1989 fall of communism.
In November, lawmakers approved a bill pushed by the Social Democrats and their coalition partner that would cancel wiretap evidence used to prosecute past corruption cases and could wipe out hundreds of convictions, including Dragnea's.
If it comes into force, the bill could retroactively cancel evidence intercepted by the intelligence services on behalf of prosecutors based on court warrants.
It could nullify hundreds of verdicts for crimes ranging from corruption to human trafficking. The bill was challenged at the Constitutional Court by the centrist opposition and the court could issue a ruling as early as Jan. 16. 
In its first stint at the helm of the European bloc, Romania faces Brexit in March, European Parliament elections in May and tough talks on the next long-term EU budget.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Indian police on Friday said they are investigating an academic, a journalist and a peasant leader for possible sedition for publicly opposing a proposal to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority countries.
Critics have called the proposal blatantly anti-Muslim and an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a general election due by May.
The cases have been filed amid a wave of protests in the BJP-governed northeastern state of Assam. A small regional party in India quit the ruling coalition on Monday in protest against the plan.
The Modi government is facing growing criticism for stifling criticism, including in the media. A television journalist in the region was jailed last month for criticizing the government on social media.
""We have registered a case against a few people based on certain statements that they made at a public rally in Guwahati,"" Deepak Kumar, a police official from Guwahati in Assam, told Reuters.
The three have not been charged.
Many people fear such a move could change the demographic profile of Assam, where residents have for years complained that immigrants from Bangladesh have put a big strain on resources.
Hiren Gohain, an 80-year-old academic, peasant leader Akhil Gogoi and journalist Manjit Mahanta have been accused of criminal conspiracy and attempting to wage a war against the government, Kumar said.
The bill, which seeks to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, has been passed by the lower house of the parliament.

The bill will be tabled for approval in the upper house in the next session, where it is expected to face resistance from the opposition Congress party. The BJP does not have a majority in the upper house of the parliament.

TAESUNG FREEDOM VILLAGE, South Korea (Reuters) - North Korea had been a source of fear for 11-year-old South Korean Sin Jae-hyeok as long as he could remember, until the moment he handed flowers to its leader, Kim Jong Un, ahead of the first summit with the South's president last April.
For the students of Daesungdong Elementary School, located in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a 4-km (2.5-mile) buffer between North and South along one of the world's most heavily fortified borders, the dramatic detente came as a surprise. 
""There were so many people around us and I was too nervous to see him, and our president as well,"" Sin, one of the school's students, told Reuters, describing his encounter with Kim ahead of the border summit.
""But actually he was nice and spoke in a friendly way."" 
The impoverished, isolated North and the wealthy, democratic South are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in a truce, rather than a peace treaty.
Most of the school's 29 pupils make an hour-long bus ride each way to the border city of Paju, rattling past anti-tank barricades, barbed-wire fences and as many as four military checkpoints. 
In the past, loudspeakers blaring propaganda from both sides made it impossible for the students to play outside, and they faced the risk of occasional exploding landmines swept along by floodwaters during the rainy seasons. 
That is no longer the case, say students and residents, as the neighbors moved to defuse tension after the summit, clearing the DMZ of loudspeakers, landmines and weapons. 
""The overall atmosphere is great and people are lively,"" said Kim Dong-ku, head of the tiny Taesung Freedom Village, where the school is located.
""We still can't believe it - just a while ago, everyone was talking about possible U.S. military action against North Korea."" 
Just eight of the 29 students came from the village last year, with the rest chosen by lottery, making a total just short of a quota of 30 agreed with the United Nations Command (UNC) that oversees DMZ affairs.
North Korea also has a primary school on the northern side of the border in line with the U.N. settlement. 
Students in the South, who pay no fees for classes or meals, have another strong incentive to attend. Volunteer soldiers from the U.S.-led UNC provide extracurricular lessons in English, a subject for which many parents otherwise pay for costly private lessons. 
With 15 candidates vying for every place, competition has grown tougher this year, an increase of about 50 percent over previous years, boosted by the rapprochement effort, Kim said. 
""It allows us to get some positive outreach within the community,"" said Daniel McShane, an American Navy lieutenant commander, who has been teaching the students for six years. ""For me personally, I've made a lot of friends here.""
Four students graduated from the school on Friday, at a gathering of about 150 people, including 30 soldiers from the UNC and Sweden and Switzerland, which are members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that monitors the 1953 armistice. 
One graduate, Jo Jun-young, said the six years he spent at the school, and the recent thaw in relations, had changed his view, not only on North Korea, but also unification.
""I used to think of North Korea as a scary place, especially after soldiers defected through the DMZ,"" the 12-year-old said. 
""Unification may be far away, but I want to go there and make friends if it happens.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government says it needs to build billions of dollars' worth of artificial islands to give the city's glittering skyline room to grow, but critics say developers are hoarding unused land that could solve the problem.
Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, estimates the 1,111-square-kilometre city needs another 1,200 hectares, or about 12 square kilometers, and has proposed creating new land offshore.
Her plan, which would cost up to $64 billion, could exhaust half of the financial hub's sizeable financial reserves.
But major developers, including Henderson Land, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai Properties, are sitting on ""no less than 1,000 hectares"" of agricultural land, according to government estimates. 
None of the three developers would clarify exactly how much rural land they hold, either directly or through shell companies. Two declined to comment on their plans for it or why they were sitting on the land.
Sun Hung Kai said it has been working to convert its agricultural land for ""appropriate developments to help address the shortage of developable land and housing in Hong Kong,"" but offered no examples.
Holding onto the land until it is rezoned for private development is potentially lucrative. Property prices have more than doubled in the last decade, and many city center private flats sell for at least $25,000 per square foot.
Augustine Ng, a former senior government town planning official for nearly three decades, is skeptical the city and developers are doing all they can.
He argues that taking over agricultural land held by developers using a powerful colonial-era ordinance would meet the city's land needs many times over.
""In a way, the developers are holding Hong Kong for ransom,"" he said.
[For a graphic of Hong Kong's land usage, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BUs5lw]
'BUSINESS SECRET'
Ng, who recently wrote a detailed proposal on solving Hong Kong's land woes, says developers conceal their acquisitions through shell companies and middle men, then sit on the land, betting prices will rise.
""There's no way you can identify who owns the land ... This is a business secret,"" he said. ""I would not be surprised if they each own 1,000 hectares.""
Groups including Liber Research, an NGO advocating equitable land usage, have investigated hundreds of such shell companies, finding some shareholders to be senior staff of big developers. 
The government gave no direct response to a Reuters inquiry on whether it had looked into developers' rural land holdings. 
A Task Force on Land Supply, including senior officials, academics and experts, has spent more than a year analyzing how to resolve the land crunch but has only a ""rough estimate"" of such land banks.
""We do have a shortage of land,"" task force chairman Stanley Wong said. ""And this has (been) jeopardizing the development of Hong Kong in the past 10 or 15 years.""
The task force concluded in a recent report that far more than 1,200 hectares were needed. It supported the artificial islands, converting former industrial ""brown field"" sites in Hong Kong's less-developed northern regions, called the New Territories, and developing part of a golf course that is home to rare trees and wildlife.
Yet it was lukewarm on taking developers' rural holdings, given the risk of protracted legal disputes and protests. 
Instead it strongly endorsed teaming up with developers, who would help build public housing in exchange for development rights on rural sites, while the government would provide costly infrastructure like roads. 
The proposal has stoked accusations that authorities are ceding power and profits to developers, according to some politicians, land rights groups and experts. The result, they say, would be lower public housing density and more private flats.
Hong Kong provides public housing to more than 2 million people for an average monthly rent of US$230 per household.
LAND LAWS
Before Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the colonial administration often deployed a powerful ""land resumption"" ordinance to take property for public use, offering compensation to landowners.
In this manner, the city built mini metropolises called ""new towns"" in the New Territories that have housed millions, many in public flats.
The Development Bureau told Reuters in a email that it planned to take back about 500 hectares of private land for a ""public purpose"" in coming years. 
Since 1997, however, new towns have all but stalled amid a freeze on public housing and a scaling back of land supplies - both meant to prop up real estate prices.
Those policies made Hong Kong homes among the world's most expensive. In a city of 7.4 million, the average wait time for public housing is 5.5 years, and the average living space for households is 430 square feet.
All land in Hong Kong is government owned and leased to buyers.
""The chief executive has not got a policy which takes hold of the land which is, and could be, available,"" said Leo Goodstadt, a former head of Hong Kong's Central Policy Unit, who last year addressed the issue in a book, ""A City Mismanaged.""
""This is the most serious problem in Hong Kong,"" he added. 
'DIRTY WORK'
Some land rights activists, villagers and experts say aggressive rural land acquisition is commonplace.
A businessman surnamed Tang, whose family owns ancestral land in Yuen Long district, says he has seen many instances of villagers' being hounded to sell land, sometimes by local gangsters.
    ""The developers don't do the dirty work themselves. In each district, they have people who buy land for them,"" Tang said, declining to give his full name, that of his village or the developer for fear of reprisal.
    ""They try to distance themselves from the thugs who could use violence to force people to sell the land,"" he said.
None of the developers responded to questions about such claims.
    Tang said he was pressured to sell one 10,000-square-foot field for HK$200 ($26) per square foot. It's hard now to find any Hong Kong flats for less than HK$10,000 ($1,277) per square foot.
Chan Wai-ming, a villager in the Shap Pat Heung district, told Reuters he was forced off a plot now held by Henderson Land.
Chan said unknown people scared his family by swearing at them frequently, placing an effigy of a devil outside his house, and scratching his car. Henderson didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.
Wu Chi-wai, the chairman of Hong Kong's largest opposition party, the Democratic Party, said developers are generous political donors, and have tremendous influence over the elite committee that selects Hong Kong's leader.
Lam's office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, saying only that ""finding land is the pressing problem that we need to tackle urgently."" None of the developers responded to requests for comment. 
Wong of the government task force told Reuters that simply rezoning and taking land from the developers had its own risks.
""They have leverage over the economy, over the community as a whole, because land is a scarce resource,"" Wong said.
In the idyllic hamlet of Ngau Tam Mei near the Chinese border, village chief Chau Kwei-yin, 63, shrugged when speaking of developers who have been circling his fields and fish ponds for years, trying to get him and others to leave. 
""I understand the need for development. The developers are just trying to make money, that's their aim in life,"" he said.

""The government needs to do more to control them and our land, for the people. After all, we're talking about Hong Kong's future.""

Natalia Veselnitskaya, who represented Russian defendants in a money laundering case settled in 2017, has been charged with obstructing justice in that case for submitting a declaration that she falsely represented came from the Russian government independently, U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2019 04:13AM ET</span>",China could lift life expectancy by nearly three years if it meets WHO smog standards: study,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China could raise average life expectancy by 2.9 years if it improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), according a new study from a U.S. research group.
China has vowed to determine the precise impact of air and water pollution on health as part of its efforts to raise average life expectancy to 79 years by 2030 from 76.3 years in 2015. 
According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), big air quality improvements made in the last five years have already been enough to push up average lifespans.
""China is winning its war against pollution ... (The country) is due to see dramatic improvements in the overall health of its people, including longer lifespans, if these improvements are sustained,"" EPIC director Michael Greenstone said at an event in Beijing on Thursday.
According to the EPIC's findings, air quality improvements made in the smog-prone northern city of Tianjin over the last five years are already expected to have raised the average lifespan of its 13 million residents by 1.2 years. 
China cut average concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 to an average of 39 micrograms per cubic meter last year, down 9.3 percent from 2017 after a campaign to curb coal use and improve industry and vehicle standards.
However, average emission levels remain significantly higher than China's own 35-microgram standard, as well as the 10-microgram limit recommended by the WHO. In northern industrial regions, average concentrations are much higher.
In a study cited by state-owned news agency Xinhua on Friday, a group of top Chinese health experts identified air and water pollution as one of the major health risks in China for the next 20 years, alongside obesity, depression and Alzheimer's disease.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang declared ""war"" on pollution in 2014 amid fears that the damage done to the country's environment as a result of more than 30 years of untrammelled economic growth would lead to social unrest.
However, with much of the low-hanging fruit already taken and the economy facing a slowdown, China has admitted that the campaign is under pressure.
""It would be very difficult for China to meet the WHO standards even with strong efforts to reduce industrial emissions and fossil fuel consumption,"" Jiang Kejun, research professor at the Energy Research Institute, a government think tank, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Thursday event.
""Emissions from non-industrial sectors, agriculture for instance, also play a big part in air pollution and are hard to put under control,"" he said.

Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe's biggest trading bloc in under 80 days but parliament looks likely to reject May's negotiated agreement next week, increasing the possibility of a disorderly Brexit.
""What is more likely if this deal is rejected is that we have the risk of Brexit paralysis and when that happens no one knows what might happen and the big risk, and what people worry about, is that we don't actually deliver what people voted for,"" Jeremy Hunt told Sky News.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned on Thursday that the world did not want to see a disorderly Brexit and that he fully supported May's withdrawal deal.
Many Brexiteer lawmakers want a cleaner break from the European Union and its institutions but Hunt said parliament, where Britain's ruling Conservatives do not have a majority, would probably not allow the country to crash out of the bloc.

""I think it's now looking much less likely that parliament would allow a no-deal outcome,"" he told the BBC.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will ask his conservative coalition ally on Friday to keep supporting the government, hoping to avert a snap election after the parties fell out over a deal on neighboring Macedonia's name. 
Tsipras has said that he will request a confidence vote if he loses the parliamentary support of the right-wing Independent Greeks (ANEL) party. ANEL has threatened to reject the Macedonia accord if it comes to parliament for approval, though it is unclear if they will pull out of government altogether.
Panos Kammenos, defense minister and head of ANEL, has described the Macedonia pact as a ""bad deal"". 
""I don't think Mr Kammenos will pull his confidence in the government.. That is what I will ask of him when I meet him on Friday,"" Tsipras told Greece's Open TV in an interview on Wednesday night.
The left-right governing coalition has a razor-thin majority, possessing just 153 seats in the 300 member parliament. Seven of those seats belong to ANEL.
Despite strong domestic opposition, Greece last year agreed to the former Yugoslav republic adopting the name North Macedonia, paving the way for Skopje's possible admission to the European Union and NATO. The accord, signed in June of last year, is now pending approval in the Macedonian parliament.
Many Greeks, however, are irked that their Balkan neighbor is assuming a name linked to Greek heritage and identical to a northern region of Greece.
Tsipras and Kammenos were expected to meet on Friday afternoon, officials said. ""The answers will be given at that meeting,"" said ANEL spokesman Theodoros Tosounidis.
Should Tsipras lose a confidence vote the country will head to snap elections. The leftist leader is trailing opinion polls behind opposition New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a conservative.
Mitsotakis has also vowed to block the deal. 
If Kammenos withdraws his support, Tsipras said that he would request a confidence vote before the deal comes to parliament. He also said that should he fail to secure an absolute majority of 151 lawmakers, he would complete some pending reforms before calling an early election. 

The coalition's full term expires in October.

Police operations targeting supporters of cleric Fethullah Gulen have been carried out regularly since the failed coup and have recently gained momentum. Gulen denies involvement in the attempt, in which 250 people were killed.
The Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said it ordered the arrest of 50 suspects - six of them officers and the rest military academy students expelled after the coup - in an investigation into people linked to Gulen in the military.
This operation, spread across 16 provinces, was focused on calls made over fixed phone lines, the statement said. 
In the southern Adana province, prosecutors ordered another 52 soldiers arrested, 42 of them serving, in an operation spread across 20 provinces, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.
It said colonels, majors, lieutenants and other serving officers were facing arrest over pay phone calls they made to other alleged Gulen-linked people. Many suspects have already been detained, it added.
More than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial, while 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs as part of the post-coup purges. Widespread operations are still routine.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concerns over the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government has said the security measures were necessary due to the gravity of the threat Turkey faces.
The owner of a restaurant chain, who had been on the run for a year after an arrest warrant was issued for him on suspected links to Gulen, was detained in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir, Anadolu also reported on Friday.

Murat Sivrikaya, whose restaurant chain has 1,100 locations across Turkey, was found carrying fake identification and is accused of being a local administrator of Gulen's network, the agency said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - More than 246,000 people have signed a petition demanding a longer jail term for a South Korean former speed skating coach convicted of assaulting an Olympic champion who has since brought fresh charges of sexual abuse when she was just 17.
The new accusations are the latest to surface since South Korea's #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault ensnared a number of high-profile political, entertainment, and religious figures last year. 
The case has made headlines in South Korea, where speed skating has a huge and devoted following. South Korea has won 24 gold medals since speed skating became an Olympic sport in 1992, more than any other country.
Former national short track speed skating coach Cho Jae-beom was convicted of assaulting two-time Olympic champion Shim Suk-hee, 21, and jailed for 10 months in September.
He punched and kicked her until ""she felt she might die"" during training before the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, according to Shim's testimony on Dec. 17, as reported by the Seoul Shinmun newspaper.
Last month, Shim also accused Cho of sexual assault of a minor and a court decided on Thursday to postpone a ruling on an appeal against the original conviction and hold a hearing on Jan. 23 to consider the new accusations, a court official said.
Shim alleges Cho had sexually assaulted her since 2014, when she was 17, according to a press release from her lawyers, whose office referred questions to the release. Shim is currently in closed-to-the-press training for the ISU Speed Skating World Cup. 
Cho denies all the sexual abuse allegations, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported on Friday, citing his lawyer, although he admitted the original assault charges. The Suwon Detention Center where he is detained denied access to reporters. He has not been charged on the sex abuse allegations.
An online petition to the South Korean presidential office asking for ""severe punishment"" for Cho on the original assault charges has been signed by 246,667 people as of Friday, saying a jail term of 10 months is not enough. 
Shim won gold medals at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics for the short track ladies' 3000m relay and has a total of 21 gold medals from international competitions, the Civic Network for Justice in Sports said. 
Yeo Jun-hyung, a former national short track coach, told reporters on Thursday that his civic group, Representatives of Solidarity for Young Skaters, had identified about five or six suspected cases of assault in the sport, and in two of the cases, victims had confirmed they had been sexually molested. 
The Korean Sport and Olympic Committee said in a statement on Thursday it will inspect all national athletes' villages and nominate female officials and human rights counselors to strengthen communication and protection of athletes.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Despite more than a year of international engagement and promises of economic reform by North Korea's leaders, the human rights situation in the isolated country remains dire, a top U.N. rights official said on Friday.
Blocked by the government from visiting North Korea, U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea Tomas Quintana visited South Korea this week as part of an investigation that will be provided to the U.N. Human Rights Council in March.
Noting that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has embarked on an effort to improve living conditions by focusing on economic development, Quintana said his preliminary findings showed those efforts had not translated into improvements in the lives of most people.
""The fact is, that with all the positive developments the world has witnessed in the last year, it is all the more regrettable that the reality for human rights on the ground remains unchanged, and continues to be extremely serious,"" he told reporters at a briefing in Seoul.
""In all areas related to the enjoyment of economic and social rights, including health, housing, education, social security, employment, food, water and sanitation, much of the country's population is being left behind.""
North Korea denies human rights abuses and says the issue is used by the international community as a political ploy to isolate it.
Human rights were noticeably absent from talks between Kim and the leaders of South Korea and the United States last year, over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But in December, the United States imposed sanctions on an additional three North Korean officials, including a top aide to Kim, for serious rights abuses and censorship.
North Korea's foreign ministry warned in a statement after the December sanctions were announced, that the measures could lead to a return to “exchanges of fire” and North Korea's disarming could be blocked forever.
While noting he had ""no specific information"" on whether international sanctions were hurting ordinary North Koreans, Quintana said the sanctions targeted the economy as a whole and ""raised questions"" about the possible impact on the public.
He cited a reference by Kim in his New Year message to the need to improve living standards, saying it was a rare acknowledgement of the economic and social hardships faced by many North Koreans.
Still, the United Nations has confirmed the continued use of political prison camps housing ""thousands"" of inmates, Quintana said, quoting one source as saying ""the whole country is a prison"".
He said witnesses who recently left North Korea reported facing widespread discrimination, labor exploitation and corruption in daily life.

There is also a ""continuing pattern of ill-treatment and torture"" of defectors who escaped to China only to be returned to North Korea by Chinese authorities, Quintana said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan on Friday appointed the former chairman of its ruling pro-independence party as premier, after the incumbent resigned along with the entire cabinet, in response to local election defeats. 
November's election losses presented a major challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen, who faced mounting criticism at home over her reform agenda while facing renewed threats from China, which considers the self-ruled island its own.
Tsai appointed Su Tseng-chang, a two-term former chairman of her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), saying Taiwan faced challenges amid rising Chinese threats and trade tension between key backer the United States and China. 
""Taiwan's democracy and development must face certain challenges,"" Tsai said, adding that China was looking to force its ""one country, two systems"" structure on the island. 
Su vowed to lead the administration amid the challenges and learn from earlier mistakes.
""The situation is difficult and the task is tough,"" he said.
Su's appointment followed the widely expected resignation of William Lai, the second premier to quit since Tsai took office in 2016, in line with a practice of leaders quitting when their party loses a major election.
""I must resign to take responsibility for the election defeat,"" Lai told a cabinet meeting earlier on Friday.
Taiwan's premier forms the cabinet and runs the government on a day-to-day basis. New ministerial appointments are expected soon. 
Just a year ahead of the next presidential election, analysts say Tsai and the new premier must shore up public support for the government's policy on China ties and further boost the island's export-reliant economy in a challenging year amid the China-U.S. trade war.
Su was appointed premier in 2006 by former president Chen Shui-bian, who infuriated Beijing and strained Taiwan's relationship with the United States during his tenure from 2000 to 2008.
Su, nicknamed ""light bulb"" by his supporters for his bald head, has led Taiwan's most populous New Taipei City for years. He was defeated by a candidate from the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang in November.
Tsai has said her administration would reflect on the election defeats but would stand firm to defend Taiwan's democracy in the face of renewed Chinese threats.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since Tsai became president, threatened this month to use force to bring the island under Beijing's rule and urged ""reunification"".
""The new premier not only has to focus on domestic matters but must also pay much more attention to cross-Strait and national security issues,"" Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to the president, told Reuters.
He said the new premier must deal with issues such as the prevention of swine fever from China and possible election interference. 

Some from within the embattled leader's party have urged Tsai not to seek re-election. She has not explicitly said whether she would run for president in 2020 but has warned against Chinese efforts to interfere with elections.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act in December, which seeks to press China to open the region by denying U.S. entry for officials deemed responsible for restricting access to Tibet.
Beijing denounced the law at the time as interference in China's internal affairs, risking ""serious harm"" to ties with Washington.
China and the United States are engaged in talks to try to hammer out a deal to end a festering trade dispute that has threatened to sour the relationship across the board, including on issues such as security, influence and human rights.
The Tibetan government will shorten the time required for foreign tourists to gain access to the region by half and boost numbers by fifty percent, Qizhala, chairman of the regional government, said in an annual work report published by the official Tibet Daily newspaper on Friday.
Non-Chinese visitors must apply for a special permit to travel to remote, mountainous Tibet, which is usually granted for tourists provided they travel with approved tour companies but rarely for journalists and diplomats.
Beijing has ruled Tibet with an iron fist since Chinese Communist Party troops marched into the region in 1950 in what it terms a ""peaceful liberation"".
Qizhala also pledged that the government in Tibet would ""take a clear-cut stance in the fight against the Dalai clique"", a reference to exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
""We must improve the monastery management and service mechanisms to defend the bottom line of Tibetan Buddhism not being manipulated by foreign forces,"" he said, and management of religious activities must prevent another ""upsurge"" of religion.
Rights groups and overseas activists say ethnic Tibetans face widespread restrictions under Chinese rule and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in June conditions were ""fast deteriorating"".
This year marks the 60th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Supporters of Tibetan independence and of the Dalai Lama have staged protests in the past to mark the uprising's anniversary, angering China.
China views the Dalai Lama, Tibet's Buddhist spiritual leader who fled into exile in India after the failed uprising, as a dangerous separatist.

The Nobel Peace laureate denies espousing violence and says he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet.

The comments suggest escalating tension between the two nations after Moon on Thursday urged Japan's political leaders not to undermine ties by ""politicising"" the issue of South Koreans forced to work by Japanese companies during World War Two. 
""President Moon's remarks are trying to shift South Korea's responsibility to Japan and it is extremely regrettable,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference. 
Relations between the East Asian neighbors have been frosty since South Korea's top court ruled in October that Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp should compensate four former laborers.
The latest flare-up came after a South Korean court this month approved the seizure of part of the domestic assets of the Japanese steelmaker.
In response, Tokyo demanded diplomatic consultations with Seoul over the issue on Wednesday.
Japan believes that all such claims were settled in a 1965 treaty that normalized relations, Suga said on Friday, and that Seoul has now broken that treaty.
""We think South Korea will respond sincerely,"" he said.

Ties are also strained over the issue of whether a South Korean warship had locked its targeting radar on a Japanese patrol plane last month.

Macri slashed subsidies for public utilities and other services to reduce the country's chronic fiscal deficit, pushing electricity and gas rates up more 2,000 percent since the start of his term, according to estimates by local media.
Rates are expected to increase even more this year.
""People can't make ends meet. All the measures taken by the government go against workers,"" Pablo Moyano, a leader of a union of truck drivers, said during the protest.
Weekly demonstrations are planned through early February, increasing pressure on Macri to solve the country's economic crisis ahead of a presidential election late this year.
Last year, when the economy contracted, inflation neared 50 percent and the peso lost close to 50 percent of its value, Macri reached an unpopular deal with the IMF for a $57 billion lifeline in exchange for a commitment to cut the deficit.
The protesters on Thursday, who witnesses estimated numbered at least 20,000, carried effigies of Macri and signs that read ""Enough of the Macri/IMF austerity program"" as they marched past the city's obelisk monument toward Congress.

A union of truck drivers and a federation of workers' unions organized the protests. Members of leftist political parties and independent Argentines have joined in.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Washington to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at one of the country's consulates in Turkey and vowed that Congress would act if the Trump administration did not.
More than a dozen senators and members of the House of Representatives, including both Democrats and Republicans, spoke at an event in the U.S. Capitol complex to celebrate a free press and remember Khashoggi and more than 50 other journalists killed around the world last year.
Democrats deplored the lack of a strong response to Khashoggi's death from President Donald Trump's administration, saying strategic or commercial ties to Saudi Arabia should not triumph over democratic values like free expression.
""If we decide commercial interests override the statements we make and the actions we take, then we must admit we have lost all moral authority,"" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.
U.S. lawmakers have been clamoring for a response to Khashoggi's murder.
In December, several of Trump's Republicans joined Democrats to defy the president and pass Senate resolutions to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in the war in Yemen and blame Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's murder.
The resolutions were not taken up by the Republicans who then led the House, but Democrats plan to revisit the issue after winning a House majority in November's elections.
Representative Mike McCaul, the top House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican, called Khashoggi's killing ""a major setback"" in relations. ""Changes need to be made,"" he said.
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, the committee's chairman, told Reuters after the event that he planned hearings on relations with Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks.
Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Washington Post journalist who became a critic of the crown prince, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. 
U.S. intelligence believes bin Salman ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi. Top Turkish officials have also tied his death to the highest levels of Saudi leadership. Saudi officials have denied accusations that the prince ordered the murder.
Trump, who has cultivated a close relationship with the crown prince, told Reuters last month he stood by the prince despite the CIA assessment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on a trip to the Middle East, including to Riyadh. A State Department official said he planned to emphasize the need for accountability and credibility in investigating Khashoggi's death.

Fayulu's supporters say the authorities rigged the result on behalf of Tshisekedi as part of a deal to protect figures from the outgoing administration. At least four people were reported killed in demonstrations in one eastern city, although much of the rest of the country appeared calm.
Tshisekedi's supporters celebrated his victory. But Thursday's intervention by the Catholic Church could make it harder for him to win broad acceptance as the first leader to come to power through the ballot box since Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was overthrown in a coup less than three months after independence in 1960.
Congolese fear that a dispute over the poll could restart a cycle of violence in a country where civil wars causing hunger and disease have killed millions of people since the 1990s.
The Catholic Church is widely venerated across the country of 80 million and is believed to have accurate election data gathered by a 40,000-strong team of election observers who tallied results displayed at individual polling stations.
While bishops stopped short of publishing their own results or saying who they believed was the true winner, they made clear it wasn't Tshisekedi, as declared by election commission CENI.
""The results from the presidential election as published by CENI do not correspond to the data collected by our observation mission from polling stations and vote counts,"" the National Episcopal Conference of Congo observers said in a statement.
Three diplomats briefed on the Church mission's tally said it showed Fayulu had won.
""OPPOSITE TO WHAT WE EXPECTED""
France and former colonial power Belgium also expressed doubt. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian demanded clarity on results ""which are the opposite to what we expected.""
Britain's foreign secretary tweeted that he was ""very concerned about discrepancies"" in the results and that the U.N. Security Council would discuss it.
Washington said in a U.S. State Department statement it ""takes note"" of the results, but added it awaits ""clarification of questions which have been raised regarding the electoral count.""
Fayulu, who has led anti-government demonstrations and is seen as far more hostile to the outgoing administration than opposition rival Tshisekedi, said Kabila had engineered an ""electoral coup"" to deny him the presidency.
In the city of Kikwit, 500 km (310 miles) from the capital Kinshasa, crowds of Fayulu supporters attacked symbols of government and clashed with security forces. Four people were killed, Kikwit's mayor Leonard Mutangu told Reuters. 
There were celebrations in parts of Kinshasa and the south of the country where Tshisekedi has broad support. Towns in Katanga, the southeastern mining heartland, were calm. 
Protests were reported in the eastern city of Kisangani, and Fayulu supporters vented their frustrations. 
""We will never accept this nomination. It's not a victory for Felix. CENI has appointed him,"" said Georges Bingi, a member of Fayulu's party in the eastern city of Goma. 
""GUN TO HIS HEAD""
Fayulu may appeal to Congo's constitutional court.
Fayulu supporters say Kabila made a deal with Tshisekedi after Kabila's own hand-picked candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, failed to gain enough support to be a credible winner. Shadary conceded following the announcement of the results.
Kabila has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father Laurent Kabila, whose victory in a 1996-1997 civil war ended more than three decades of rule by dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
Kabila says he wants to stay in politics and may run again in 2023, when he will no longer be barred by term limits.
Tshisekedi inherited the leadership of his UDPS party when his father Etienne Tshisekedi died in 2017. But he lacks the experience, political clout and firebrand reputation his father earned as a leading opposition figure since the Mobutu era.
An official from the from U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations said Tshisekedi's win might buy some temporary calm but that ""the exiled and cheated will rebel,"" referring to ex-militia and political leaders who are backing Fayulu. 
""Tshisekedi has no capacity to rule, no way of controlling the army or ministerial appointments. He will do as told, gun to his head,"" the official said. 
In the run-up to the results, Tshisekedi said Kabila had nothing to fear should he come to power. Fayulu, by contrast, is backed by ex-rebel Jean-Pierre Bemba and former governor Moise Katumbi, two of Kabila's fiercest rivals.
Any escalation from the Fayulu camp risks igniting Congo's cycle of unrest, particularly in the eastern borderlands where he enjoys strong support and dozens of militia groups operate.
It is unclear whether voting will ever be held in parts of Congo where the election was delayed - disenfranchising more than 1.2 million people - due to concerns about Ebola and violence. Tshisekedi's margin over Fayulu was less than 700,000 votes, according to the official results. 
Members of Tshisekedi's UDPS party called the election a historic triumph in a struggle for democracy. The inauguration had been scheduled for Jan. 18.

""Today marks the liberation of the people,"" said Simphora Biduaya, a candidate for provincial assembly in the east.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Self-described computer whiz Christian Rodriguez told jurors on Thursday how he had a nervous breakdown from the stress of cooperating with the FBI to hack into the secure communication system he built for accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
On trial in U.S. federal court in Brooklyn since November, Guzman, 61, was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.
The witness testimonies have given a glimpse into the secretive and often violent workings of the cartel, one of the most powerful drug trafficking operations in the world.
It was the second day of testimony for prosecution witness Rodriguez, 32, who said he worked for Guzman from 2008 to 2012 and built a system allowing members of the cartel to communicate securely using private servers, Nokia (HE:NOKIA) phones and Blackberries. 
The Colombian-born Rodriguez told jurors he was approached in Bogota in 2011 by FBI agents who told him they knew he worked for Guzman and that he was in ""serious trouble."" Rodriguez said he agreed to cooperate with them the same day.
He gave the FBI the passwords to the secure servers he built for Guzman, as well as for software he secretly installed on some of his associates' phones that allowed Guzman to spy on them, Rodriguez has testified.
The value of Rodriguez's assistance to prosecutors became obvious this week, as jurors were presented with a slew of Guzman's phone calls and text messages intercepted thanks to his cooperation.
Much of the evidence in the trial so far has consisted of spoken testimony from witnesses whose credibility Guzman's lawyers have done their best to undermine. Many of the intercepted communications jurors heard this week, however, appear unambiguously to show Guzman discussing high-volume drug trafficking and bribing officials.
Guzman's lawyers have portrayed their client as a scapegoat for what they have called Sinaloa's real leader, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, who also faces U.S. charges but remains at large.
Rodriguez said he fled to the United States in fear of his life after learning that Guzman's associates knew he was cooperating with the FBI. He said he later had a nervous breakdown from stress, was hospitalized and underwent electroconvulsive treatment.
Under cross-examination by one of Guzman's lawyers, Eduardo Balarezo, Rodriguez admitted family difficulties also contributed to his stress and nervous breakdown.
To protect Rodriguez, court sketch artists have been ordered not to draw his face, and photos released of him have been pixilated.
Late in the day, Alex Cifuentes, a member of the Colombian drug trafficking family that Rodriguez said introduced him to Guzman, took the stand. Dressed in prison garb, he said he worked for Guzman from 2007 until his 2013 arrest. 
Cifuentes, who pleaded guilty to U.S. drug charges and is cooperating with prosecutors, is expected to continue testifying on Monday.

The trial began Nov. 13 and is expected to last a few more weeks. Guzman faces life in prison if convicted.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>","In Cairo, Pompeo blasts Obama's Middle East policies","By Lesley Wroughton and Lena Masri
CAIRO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday accused Barack Obama of sowing chaos by abandoning the Middle East to Islamist militants and Iranian influence in a blistering critique of the former president's policies even as Pompeo's boss, President Donald Trump, moves to pull American troops out of Syria.
In a speech at the American University in Cairo, Pompeo dispensed with a U.S. diplomatic tradition of avoiding public airing abroad of domestic disputes by blasting Obama at the site of a landmark 2009 speech by Trump's predecessor aimed at improving relations with the Islamic world.
Pompeo presented America as ""a force for good in the Middle East"" and suggested Obama saw the United States as ""a force for what ails the Middle East.""
Some former U.S. officials and analysts accused the top American diplomat of misreading history and camouflaging Trump's own desire to reduce U.S. commitments in the region.
Pompeo accused Obama of underestimating ""the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism,"" of failing to adequately support the 2009 ""Green Movement"" mass protests against a disputed election in Iran, and faulted him for not bombing Syria in retaliation for chemical weapons use by government forces in its civil war.
""What did we learn from all of this? We learned that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. And when we partner with our enemies, they advance,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo did not mention Obama by name but called him ""another American"" who had given a speech in the capital of the Arab world's most-populous nation. Obama's office declined comment on the speech. 
Pompeo is touring the region to try to explain U.S. strategy after Trump's surprise announcement last month of an abrupt withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, which rattled allies, shocked top U.S. officials and prompted U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's resignation.
It is highly unusual for an American secretary of state to give a speech abroad directly attacking a former U.S. president. Trump has reversed Obama's policies on international issues such as the Iran nuclear deal, trade agreements and the Paris climate change accord as well as a host of domestic policies. 
Pompeo sought to reassure allies that Washington remains committed to the ""complete dismantling"" of the threat posed by the Islamic State militant group and to ending Iranian influence in Syria despite Trump's decision to withdraw troops there.
""In Syria, the United States will use diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot,"" Pompeo said. 
Pompeo faulted what he called Obama's ""desire for peace at any cost"" that led him to reach the 2015 nuclear deal under which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear weapons program in exchange for easing of international economic sanctions.
Trump last year abandoned that deal, pursuing instead a policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran to try to force it to limit its nuclear program, curtail its ballistic missile activities and cease supporting proxy forces in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.
Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, mocked Pompeo's speech, writing on Twitter: ""Whenever/wherever US interferes, chaos, repression and resentment follow.""
Many people in the Middle East are likely to disagree with Pompeo's assertion that the United States is a force for good in the region. Policies such as U.S. support for Israel, the American-backed 1953 coup that overthrew Iran's popular Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq to topple President Saddam Hussein remain deeply controversial in the region.
'SELF-INFLICTED AMERICAN SHAME'
In his June 2009 Cairo University speech, Obama advocated better mutual understanding between the Islamic world and the West and said both should do more to confront violent extremism. As a result, Republicans have accused Obama of apologizing to the world for U.S. actions abroad.
""The good news,"" Pompeo said, ""is this: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over. And so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.""
Some Middle East experts and officials who served under Obama accused Pompeo of violating the American tradition that ""politics stops at the water's edge.""
""It feels a little bit as if the approach is to 'talk loudly and carry a small stick,'"" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
""You could read this as obscuring a continued U.S. retrenchment from Middle Eastern commitments,"" Alterman added.
Pompeo received support from United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash, who said on Twitter that ""Washington, through its secretary of state, is asserting the importance of its alliances and supporting its friends.""
Pompeo pointedly repudiated Obama's 2009 speech.
""He told you that radical Islamist terrorism does not stem from an ideology. He told you that 9/11 (the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States) led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East,"" Pompeo said.

""The results of these misjudgments have been dire,"" Pompeo added. ""In falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East, we were timid in asserting ourselves when the time and our partners demanded it.""

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>",Grisly Mexican gang battle near U.S. border leaves 21 dead,"By Delphine Schrank
REYNOSA, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican authorities are investigating a battle between two suspected gangs that left 21 dead in a border town near where U.S. President Donald Trump visited on Thursday to win support for his plan to build a wall.
Tamaulipas state officials said that 21 bodies were found Wednesday in the city of Ciudad Miguel Aleman. Seventeen were burned, they said.
Trump was visiting McAllen, Texas on Thursday afternoon, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) from Ciudad Miguel Aleman, across the Rio Grande river, to drum up support for a border wall. He threatened to use emergency powers to bypass Congress and get billions of dollars to pay for the wall. 
He has justified that demand by saying that undocumented migrants, criminals and illegal drugs have been pouring across the border. Statistics show illegal immigration has fallen to a 20-year low, while many drugs are believed to enter through legal ports of entry.
Photos shared with Reuters by a state official show charred bodies scattered along a dirt track in scrubland, alongside burned-out vehicles. 
One body was wearing the remains of a baseball cap bearing the letters and logo of the local Gulf Cartel, while others wore the remains of bullet-proof vests with the same insignia.
Turf wars between the Gulf Cartel and its chief rival, the Zetas, have been a key source of bloodshed over recent years in Tamaulipas, one of the most violent states in Mexico.
Luis Rodriguez, a spokesman for state police, said in a statement that it appeared gunmen from the Gulf Cartel had fought with members of the Northeast Cartel, a group that split off from the Zetas. 
Irving Barrios, the state's attorney general, said in a radio interview that authorities found semi-automatic weapons and bulletproof vehicles at the site.
The area is ""greatly fought over"" by traffickers of arms and drugs as well as those who help undocumented migrants to cross to the United States, he said.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Mexico during years of fighting between security forces and cartels warring over drug trafficking, extortion rackets and the exploitation of migrants.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 03:36PM ET</span>",Israel says U.S. blocks its sale of fighter jets to Croatia,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Israel will not be able to deliver to Croatia a dozen used F-16 fighter jets which Croatia decided to buy last year to modernize its air force, Croatia's Defense Minister Damir Krsticevic said on Thursday.
""Israel has officially informed us that it cannot get an approval from the United States for delivery of the planes to Croatia,"" Krsticevic told reporters after a meeting with an Israeli delegation in Zagreb.
Officials from both sides said Croatia held no responsibility for the deal falling through. They gave no comment on why the United States opposed the sale.
Croatian media reported the problem arose as the planes have been refitted with Israeli technology, depriving U.S. defense companies the chance to update and service the planes.
The U.S. State Department did not comment because it was on furlough. 
Croatia's Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earlier this week that Zagreb would not accept any other deal but the original Israeli offer which it accepted last March.
""The agreement on buying the planes has not been signed, so there is no financial damage to our budget,"" Plenkovic told a cabinet session on Thursday.
He added that Croatia was determined to continue with its plans of modernizing its air force. It is unclear at the moment whether Zagreb would now call another tender or turn to other bidders that competed in a previous tender.
The deal with Israel was supposed to be worth $500 million.
Israel had been in competition with several countries bidding for Zagreb's business. Sweden's SAAB was reported as being the most serious competitor, offering new Gripen planes, but at a much higher price.
Croatia joined the NATO alliance in 2009 and the EuropeanUnion in 2013. Its air force currently owns a squadron of outdated MIG-21 fighter jets, but just three planes are operational at the moment.

President Emmanuel Macron has faced since mid-November violent anti-government protests originally against since-scrapped fuel tax hikes, but which have snowballed into rage against the high cost of life and Macron's reform drive. 
Although the 41-year-old leader has insisted he will maintain his push to modernize the French economy, some economists have raised questions about whether he may be forced to scale down his ambitions in the face of waves of street protests.
""The will and the necessity to reform France seems to me to be intact. What is key is that it is explained and shared, and that it is seen as just,"" Villeroy said in Luxembourg.
Desperate to contain the uprising, Macron's government announced wage increases in December for the poorest workers and a tax cut for most pensioners.
But the measures will leave a 10 billion euro ($11.5 billion) hole in the Treasury's finances, pushing France back over the EU deficit limit of 3 percent of national output.

""The yellow vest crisis justified an emergency package to support purchasing power, but I don't think it is neither desirable nor probable that it interrupts reforms underway,"" Villeroy said.

She also said, after meeting Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens, that she expected Greece would be able to return to financial markets and that Germany supported those efforts.
""I'm particularly happy to see that the situation has changed so much, unemployment has fallen...,"" she said through an interpreter.
""Of course it is not the end... of a period of reforms, but the beginning of a new situation."" 
Greece emerged in August from the stranglehold of international bailouts, which included a decades-old austerity drive Greeks widely blamed on Berlin.
Some supervision by the European Union continues, to ensure the country does not backtrack on reform efforts.
Leftist Tsipras, elected on a platform of reversing austerity in 2015 only to yield to a third bailout months later, also said Greece had turned a page.
""Today you are coming to a different Greece,"" he told Merkel. ""We both went through difficult moments... but we managed to find... solutions to overcome the challenges.""

A couple of hundred demonstrators clashed with police on the fringes of a security perimeter. Police used teargas to disperse them, a Reuters witness said. But the visit was largely peaceful compared to the violent protests of the past.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>",Saudi woman's flight rallies opposition to male guardianship,"By Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Saudi woman's flight from what she said was an abusive family has rallied opposition to the kingdom's male guardianship system, still a major constraint on women despite the conservative Muslim country's efforts to open up.
Some freedoms have been granted under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who ended a ban on women driving, eased restrictions on gender mixing, and championed firsts such as allowing women to serve in the armed forces.
Yet those changes have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the arrest and alleged torture of some of the activists who campaigned for decades to improve women's rights - as well as Muslim preachers who opposed them.
Many activists are calling for an end to the guardianship system, which has been chipped away at slowly over the years but remains in force.
Under the system, every Saudi women is assigned a male relative - often a father or husband but sometimes an uncle, brother or even a son - whose approval is needed if she is to marry, obtain a passport and travel abroad.
The plight of Rahaf Mohammed al-Qanun, who slipped away from her family last weekend during a holiday in Kuwait, recalls the cases of other Saudi women who fled mistreatment only to be forcibly returned to the kingdom and never heard from again.
Amid global outrage at Saudi Arabia over last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Qanun's tweets from Bangkok airport sparked an online campaign. She barricaded herself inside a hotel room for hours until the Thai government reversed its decision to send her home.
In some countries, her adult age would have prevented the authorities from telling her family anything about her. In Saudi Arabia, her gender meant she was her father's ward.
""Remove guardianship and we won't all migrate"" trended this week on Twitter in Saudi Arabia.
Mai, who identified as a 36-year-old physician, said she was embarrassed to have two children and a degree from Harvard University but still be viewed as a minor.
""I am trusted to make life and death decisions for patients, trusted to raise kids ... but not trusted to make my own decisions regarding MY life. The irony! #EndMaleGuardianship,"" she tweeted.
Qanun was also attacked on social media for shaming her family and renouncing Islam, highlighting the delicate balance Prince Mohammed must strike in reforming Saudi society without destabilizing it.
FAMILY PROBLEM
Guardianship's status between law and custom makes it a thorny issue for Prince Mohammed, who indicated last year he favored ending the system but stopped short of endorsing its annulment.
""If I say yes to this question, that means I’m creating problems for the families that don’t want to give freedom for their daughters,"" he told U.S. magazine The Atlantic. 
Without a codified system of law to go with the texts making up sharia, or Islamic law, the Saudi police and judiciary have long cited social customs in enforcing certain prohibitions on women. Many aspects of guardianship stem from informal practice rather than specific laws.
Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most gender-segregated nations, is ranked 138 of 144 states in the 2017 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.
Activists launched the ""I Am My Own Guardian"" campaign in 2016 demanding legal representation.
King Salman issued an order the following year allowing women to benefit from services such as education and healthcare without the consent of a male guardian, though rights groups say this is being implemented only on a limited basis.
Other challenges remain. There is no formal bar on women buying or renting property but it can be difficult for them to do so without a male relative, according to rights groups.
Authorities have removed restrictions on women in the labor code and ended formal requirements for them to obtain a guardian's permission to work, but some employers still demand this and are not penalized for doing so.
The kingdom also ended requirements that a woman bring a male relative to identify her in court, and women can obtain a license and drive cars without their guardian's approval.
Mohammed al-Issa, a former justice minister who sits on the kingdom's top clerical body, told Reuters last year there was no reason why women should be barred from obtaining a passport or traveling without the consent of a male guardian but it may take time for society to accept that.
Some Saudi women do not want to wait.

""We have the right (to) be treated as adults since we're above 18 years,"" a woman named Fatin wrote online. ""This guardianship is no more than modern enslavement system!""

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 12:23PM ET</span>",Former U.S. Marine held for spying had Russian contacts with military backgrounds,"By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Maxim Rodionov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Paul Whelan, the former U.S. Marine held in Moscow on spying charges, had online contact with more than 20 Russians with military backgrounds, an analysis of social media shows.
Russian men with military education or a history of military service make up nearly half of Whelan's more than 50 friends on VK, a popular Russian social network that resembles Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the analysis by Reuters shows. 
At least 12 of his friends received military education in Russia, according to open source information, and at least another 11 appear to have completed national service. 
In addition, about a fifth of those on Whelan's list have backgrounds in IT, engineering or civil aviation, a quarter are not connected to the military or technical sectors, and there is no information about the rest.
Whelan's family says he is innocent and was in Moscow for a wedding when he was arrested last month. The ""Free Paul Whelan"" Twitter page managed by the family has used the hashtag #JustATourist in one of its posts. 
Russian authorities have not given details of his alleged spying, and the FSB security service did not respond immediately to questions on whether Whelan's online activity was linked to his detention. 
Analysis of Whelan's online activity - including exchanges with Russian friends and content on their own accounts - provides a fuller picture of his contacts than has so far been revealed.
Reuters contacted 38 people on Whelan's VK friend list, almost all men in their 20s. 
Whelan, 48, contacted them years ago through pen-pal websites or VK, corresponding occasionally online over the years, five of his contacts told Reuters. 
Whelan's military contacts in Russia are low-level, come from various regions and have served in the army, airborne forces and navy, according to information and pictures posted online. 
In Russia, men aged between 18 and 27 are conscripted into the military for a year. Enrolment at military academies, which is not mandatory, can lead to a career in the services. 
Asked if he was aware of Whelan's Russian military contacts online, his brother David said: ""I didn't know he had a VK account before last week. But I'm not surprised that he had friends on social media, both Facebook and VK, that had military backgrounds just as he had a military background.""
Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, was not available for comment. 
The arrest of Whelan, who also holds British citizenship, further strains relations between Moscow and Washington, which have soured over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, economic sanctions and accusations of election meddling.
ONLINE ACTIVITY
The ""Free Paul Whelan"" Twitter page shows postcards Whelan sent to his sister from Russia in 2015 and 2018. 
Whelan first posted on his VK page in November 2010 and has since published congratulations on Russian public holidays, military celebrations and other events. 
In February 2015, he posted: ""In Moscow ..."" along with a Russian mobile phone number. Calls to it this week went unanswered.
One of Whelan's friends lists his employer as the Russian Defence Ministry and writes that he studied at the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School, a military academy. 
A picture posted in 2012 shows the friend in a Russian serviceman's striped vest under a green camouflage jacket. 
Another 26-year-old Russian posted pictures of himself and classmates at the Naval Cadet Corps, which trains naval officers in St Petersburg.
A man apparently in his 20s posted pictures of himself in a paratrooper's blue beret and army fatigues bearing the inscription: ""Nizhegorodsky Cadet Corps"". 
Vadim Izotov said he first interacted with Whelan in 2008 while at the defense ministry's Military University. He was surprised Whelan had been charged with espionage.
""I understood he had a positive attitude towards Russia, towards our culture. That's why he traveled here,"" he said. 
""He communicated with Russian military here because he himself had been a serviceman.""
Lenar Azmukhanov, a 30-year-old from Kazan who attended the Ulyanovsk Higher Military Technical College, said he and Whelan congratulated each other on holidays but their interaction did not go beyond that. 
Another friend of Whelan's, who did not want to be named, said he first had contact with him in 2005 or 2006 on a pen-pal website. They met once in person in 2008.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Treasury Board President Scott Brison, a senior member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet, said on Thursday he would quit, a move that will deprive the ruling Liberals of a political veteran as they gird for a tightly contested federal election this October.
Brison, Canada's first openly gay cabinet minister, announced his decision on Twitter, saying he wants to spend more time with his young family after 22 years in politics.
As head of the Treasury Board, Brison, 51, is in overall control of public spending. Although he did not specify when he intended to leave his post, a spokesman said it would be soon.
In a tweet of thanks, Trudeau called Brison ""a tireless champion"" for Canada.
Trudeau will carry out a shuffle on Monday to replace Brison, a spokeswoman for the prime minister said. 
Brison also said he would not run in the October election. He represents a Parliamentary constituency in Atlantic Canada, where the Liberals won all 32 seats in the 2015 election that brought them to power.
Brison and his husband have twin four-year-old daughters. He was first elected as a legislator for the right-leaning Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Conservatives in 1997 but switched to the Liberals in 2003.
His departure could also spare the Liberals some political awkwardness, since he is due to be a key witness in the August trial of an admiral who has been accused of leaking information about a contract to build navy supply ships.

Last October Brison denied allegations that he privately lobbied cabinet colleagues on behalf of a major shipbuilder in his home province of Nova Scotia. Brison's spokesman said the decision to leave politics had nothing to do with the trial.

Dmitry Rogozin, who is under U.S. sanctions, was scheduled to visit next month at NASA's invitation. But NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told The Washington Post last week that the invitation had been rescinded at the request of U.S. senators.
""It's a disgrace, this is illegal, and complete international lawlessness,"" Rogozin told the Rossiya-24 state TV channel.
Several U.S. senators were reported to be deeply unhappy about the prospect of Rogozin being allowed to visit the United States despite his being on a sanctions list over his support for his country's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. 
Rogozin said NASA appeared to have fallen victim to a conflict between Congress and President Donald Trump. Pro-Kremlin politicians often say that they believe Trump is seeking to improve relations with Moscow, but is being held back by anti-Russian lawmakers. 
""I think that America is now consumed by what is essentially its second civil war,"" Rogozin said, commenting on why his visit had been canceled. 
""(What happened) ... is a piece of the battle between Congress and Trump, and NASA in this particular case is a victim of this battle.
""We are waiting for our colleagues to calm down. We are waiting for an explanation.""

Despite the snub, Rogozin said he remained open to cooperation with the United States in the sphere of space and invited NASA's Bridenstine to come to Russia for talks on how the two agencies could work together in future, something he said both countries needed.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Political divisions will not impede Romania's six-month presidency of the European Union, its foreign minister said on Thursday.
In its first stint at the helm of the EU, Romania faces Brexit, due to happen in March, European Parliament elections in May and tough talks on the next long-term EU budget.
But the second-poorest EU country, which joined in 2007, is politically divided ahead of the European elections and its own presidential polls toward the end of the year. It is also under EU scrutiny over corruption and concerns about the rule of law.
President Klaus Iohannis, a centrist who represents Romania at EU summits, has been critical of the social democratic government's preparedness for the EU presidency and its plans to overhaul the judiciary that have raised EU concern.
The government would rather the prime minister represent Bucharest at EU summits.
""The government of Romania ... will do its best to have a successful presidency,"" Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu told reporters ahead of a ceremony marking the start of the presidency later on Thursday. 
""It is not a project of a majority, or of a government, it is a country project for Romania after 10 years of participation in the EU.""
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said late last year the Romanian government ""has not yet fully understood what it means to preside over EU countries.""
Melescanu downplayed the political infighting.
""It is obvious we have a political competition internally, which is quite normal in any democratic society. It is proof of very vivid democratic life in Romania,"" he said.
Romania's Minister for European Affairs George Ciamba said Romania was ready to handle the presidency but the political dispute in Bucharest was unlikely to end.
""Presidency or not, this is not going to stop,"" Ciamba said.
""We have to acknowledge that we have European elections coming, so I think we are going to have politics all over Europe."" 
While not formally under an EU monitoring procedure like Poland or Hungary, Romania has raised concern by its attempts to decriminalize several corruption offences and changes to the criminal codes.
The leader of the ruling social democrats, Liviu Dragnea, has convictions for vote rigging and abuse of office. 
Dragnea's convictions barred him from becoming prime minister and he has been pushing Prime Minister Viorica Dancila's government for legal changes, including a decree that would grant prison pardons and amnesty, including for himself.

Championed by veteran conservative and former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, Merz is popular with members of the party's right wing who want to change direction from Merkel's centrist economic and migrant policies.
In particular, the CDU needs to boost its support this year before regional elections in three eastern states where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is strong.
Merz's narrow loss to Merkel protege Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as party leader exposed divisions in the CDU that both candidates vowed to heal, and she made clear she wanted him to play an active role.
The CDU said Merz would take a position on the CDU commission for the social market economy and would have a special focus on the future of transatlantic ties. 
""I am pleased that Friedrich Merz brings his experience and knowledge of economic and financial policy. An excellent strengthening of our circle of experts from representatives of industry and science,"" tweeted Kramp-Karrenbauer.
A trained lawyer, Merz had lost out to Merkel in a power struggle in 2002 and has been out of the lower house, the Bundestag, since 2009. Since then he has had various corporate roles including chairman of the German arm of the U.S. investment fund BlackRock.
He had hinted he would like a cabinet post, but Merkel ruled that out.

Merkel relinquished leadership of the party after the CDU haemorrhaged support in a regional election in October, but has said she intends to remain chancellor until the next election in 2021.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Winning a beauty pageant should be a moment of joy, but Miss Algeria Khadija Ben Hamou, from the country's vast desert south, was immediately targeted online for her dark skin color.
Ben Hamou, 26, is the first southerner to win the title that leads to a shot at the Miss World crown.
More than 75 percent of Algerians live in the north, with most prominent figures in public life being lighter skinned northerners. Only one government minister is dark skinned.
Some southerners feel excluded from development in comparison with northerners, despite the region, bordering Mali and Niger, being rich in oil and gas and providing 95 percent of Algeria’s revenue. 
As footage of the contest spread on social media, trolls branded her ""ugly"" and told her ""shame on you"", although some applauded her beauty, saying it represented ""Algeria's diversity"".
Ben Hamou, from Adrar, some 1,000 km south of the capital Algiers, dismissed the criticism.
""Algeria is a big country, east, west, north and south. We represent the country. I won the contest and I want to say to those who criticized me, Allah blesses you,"" the restaurant worker told Reuters.
""I hope I will be a good representative of the people of the south,"" she said.
Said Hamdad Faysal, from the Miss Algeria contest organizers and sponsor, said Ben Hamou had passed through 20 rounds to win the contest.
She will go on tour to promote charity programs, he said.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: Can Britain's parliament prevent a no-deal Brexit?,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's political weakness was exposed by a series of defeats in parliament this week, prompting claims that rebel lawmakers can wrest control of the process to leave the European Union.
But can lawmakers stop a no-deal Brexit? 
On Tuesday, lawmakers voted to limit the government’s tax-raising powers in the event it decides to pursue a no-deal Brexit without parliament’s explicit approval, part of a campaign to stop the country leaving the EU in a disorderly fashion.
Lawmakers again defeated the government on Wednesday, forcing the prime minister to come back to parliament within three working days with a new plan if, as is widely expected, her Brexit deal with the EU is defeated on Jan. 15.
IS THERE A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT FOR STOPPING A NO-DEAL BREXIT?
    Almost certainly, yes. Tuesday's vote indicates that all the main opposition parties and at least 20 lawmakers in the ruling Conservative Party are opposed to leaving the EU without a deal.
    May is the weakest British leader in a generation, with a working majority of 13 lawmakers in parliament. Her minority government is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party to pass legislation. 
    As the opposition parties and pro-European lawmakers in the Conservative Party have proved this week, they have the numbers to defeat the government.
SO CAN THEY STOP THE GOVERNMENT LEAVING WITHOUT A DEAL?
There is no clear legal route available to them to stop a no-deal Brexit.
    Opposition to no-deal in itself is not enough. They can only stop Brexit if there is a clear majority in favor of an alternative outcome to the prime minister's deal.    At the moment, under British law and Article 50 of the European Union treaty, Britain will leave the EU on March 29 at 2300 GMT with or without a deal. This date was set in law in the Withdrawal Act that was passed by lawmakers last June.
According to The Institute for Government, ministers can change the act by secondary legislation if another date is contained in the withdrawal agreement or if an Article 50 extension is secured. 
But if there is no deal, and therefore no withdrawal agreement, they would have to change the date through new primary legislation. 
    ""Is there a parliamentary route by which Brexit can be stopped? I do not believe so,"" Chris Heaton-Harris, a junior Brexit minister, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. 
    ""With the legislation that we have passed, if we do not leave with a deal, currently, we will be leaving without a deal.""
WHAT ELSE CAN LAWMAKERS DO TO STOP A NO-DEAL BREXIT?
To minimize disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit the government is expected to have to bring forward at least some primary legislation.
    At least four new laws, including on such matters as trade, immigration and agriculture, need to be passed before Brexit and they could potentially be hijacked to make leaving without a deal harder. 
    Bernard Jenkin, a pro-Brexit lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party and chair of the constitutional affairs committee, said that although this would hit the government's no-deal preparations it would not prevent Britain leaving.
    ""It is disruptive. It is sabotage. But if that is what the House of Commons wants to do it can do it. But it doesn't change the date,"" Jenkin said.
ARE THERE OTHER WAYS FOR REBELS TO STOP A NO-DEAL BREXIT?
Yes, but they are political, rather than legal avenues.
    If lawmakers by a decisive majority voted in favor of extending the EU exit process or for a second referendum the motions would not be legally binding on the government, but it would be hard to resist the political force of such a vote. 
    For example, a parliamentary vote is not a legal requirement for military action, but David Cameron, then prime minister, abandoned plans for intervention in Syria after a parliamentary defeat in 2013.
ARE THE RULES SET IN STONE?
Britain does not have a codified constitution. Instead, it has laws, conventions and practices that have evolved over centuries, often during national crises. 
That leaves some room for maneuver.

The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, said on Wednesday that if parliament was always bound by precedent ""nothing would change and things do change"".

Russia said last month it was launching an investigation into the BBC in response to pressure it said London was applying on a Kremlin-funded broadcaster's operations in Britain.
The broadcasters have been drawn into a bitter row between London and Moscow that erupted last year over the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. Britain said Russian secret agents made a botched attempt to assassinate Skripal using a military-grade nerve agent, an allegation Russia denied.
""Checks are underway into whether the BBC's internet sites... comply with Russian law. To date, material has been uncovered which transmits the ideological principles of a terrorist group (quotes of the terrorist al-Baghdadi),"" the regulator said in a statement.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the leader of Islamic State. The group is outlawed in Russia.
""An investigation is underway into whether these materials are in compliance with the norms of Russian legislation,"" the regulator's statement said.
When the Russian investigation was initially announced last month, the BBC said it was in full compliance with Russian law. The broadcaster has a sizeable Russian-language operation, based in Moscow and London.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain faces a fresh food bottleneck if it drops out of the EU without a deal, the country's largest supermarket group warned on Thursday, echoing comments from its biggest rival the previous day.
As the country counts down to Brexit while politicians remain deadlocked over how best to oversee its departure on March 29,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) said it had increased stockholdings of ambient foods such as bottles, packets and tins and made clear plans for each product category.
But, with Britain importing about half the fresh food it eats, putting no-deal contingencies in place for perishables was not an option.
""It's not so possible to do that sort of thing on fresh food, so that's where the pinch point would be if there were to be a no-deal,"" Chief Executive Dave Lewis said.
On Wednesday No. 2 supermarket player Sainsbury's, which imports about 30 percent of its food from continental Europe, issued a similar warning.
""It will be hugely disruptive if there was a no-deal Brexit for the supply chains that we operate...,"" its Chief Executive Mike Coupe said.
""No amount of stockpiling will mitigate that risk simply because we don't have the capacity and neither does the country to stockpile more than probably a few days' worth.""
The uncertainty over Brexit looks set to deepen on Tuesday, when a divided parliament is expected to vote down the departure deal that Prime Minister Theresa May struck with Brussels.
May has said a vote against would be opening the way for a disorderly exit or for Brexit not to happen at all, while opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Thursday for an election to break the impasse.
Supermarket groups, under pressure to keep shelves stocked with hundreds of thousands of product lines, want as little friction as possible at European borders
They fear a no-deal Brexit could mean major delays at ports.
Analysts pointed out that in 2018 it only took a few days of heavy snow disruption when the ""Beast from the East"" hit Britain before gaps opened up on supermarket shelves.
They also say that any pinch in supply will likely result in price increases in fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products.
No. 4 supermarket player Morrisons said on Tuesday its Brexit planning group had moved to ""a more operational footing,"" while on Thursday Marks & Spencer said it had ""upped the ante"" and started to make choices.

KOCHI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two women who made history by becoming the first in centuries to enter a hill temple in southern India are in hiding after threats by hardline Hindu groups. 
The Sabarimala temple in the state of Kerala has been the site of tension since India's Supreme Court ruled in late September to end a ban on women of menstruating age entering it.
There have since been sporadic outbreaks of violence between the authorities and protesters attempting to prevent women from entering, setting off a cultural battle in what is still a deeply religious country.
Bindu Ammini, 40, a law lecturer at Kerala's Kannur University and Kanakadurga, 39, a civil servant, told Reuters they were determined to enter despite threats of violence. 
""A lot of people tried to dissuade us and make us turn back - police officers, our friends... because they knew we were facing a lot of backlash,"" Kanakadurga said. 
After the Supreme Court's judgment, the women made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the temple on Dec. 24, before finally succeeding on Jan. 2. 
A third woman aged 46 has since entered the site, the office of the chief minister of Kerala said on Jan. 4. 
""We felt no fear. We had only one aim: we wanted to go to that shrine,"" Bindu said. 
Their entry sparked widespread protests and a day-long strike in Kerala led in part by members of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
""This BJP government has a duty to regulate and control their members,"" Bindu said. 
The women - speaking in an undisclosed location on the outskirts of the city of Kochi - say they have since faced threats from protesters, but that they trusted the authorities to keep them safe and plan to return home next week. 

""I always say that I trust the police persons, the state government of Kerala and also our democratic society of Kerala,"" Bindu said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Blacklisted jihadist fighters tightened their grip over Syria's last major rebel-held region on Thursday after nine days of battle with Turkey-backed groups, putting a deal to prevent a massive army assault on the area in jeopardy.
The northwest of Syria near the Turkish border is the last part of the country still in the hands of fighters seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad, but control has been divided between jihadist factions and other rebels backed by Turkey.
On Thursday Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist group listed as terrorists by the United States, Turkey and others, forced factions from the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) to accept a peace deal recognizing civilian control by an HTS-backed administration.
The success of the jihadists in recent days raises doubt over the future of a deal agreed in September between Turkey and the Assad government's main ally Russia to avert an army assault. The agreement requires banned jihadist groups to be expelled from a frontline buffer zone. 
Much of the Idlib enclave is now controlled by HTS, which is spearheaded by the former Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda.
Under Thursday's agreement, FSA groups accepted civilian control of some towns and villages by a body known as the Salvation Government which runs basic services in the city of Idlib and many towns that fall under HTS influence.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu acknowledged on Thursday it was not ""so easy"" to maintain the deal with Russia, but said so far it was being ""implemented successfully"".
""The radical groups have mounted an attack against the moderate opposition. And of course we are taking the necessary precautions,"" Cavusoglu said in an interview with broadcaster NTV.
A rebel official close to Turkey's intelligence service said Ankara had played a key role in preventing the fighting from spreading further by pressing rebels to accept a deal. 
HTS's stranglehold over the area is raising fears among rebels and residents in the heavily populated province that Russian air strikes halted last year could resume. 
The jihadists have allowed Turkish troops to deploy along the front lines as the Russia-Turkey deal demanded, but have not pulled out of the area themselves.
""The complete control of (HTS) will be a pretext for the regime and the Russians to end the Idlib deal, and this is the coming danger,"" said Major Youssef Hamoud, spokesman for a Turkey-backed alliance of rebels called the National Army.
Some factions who fought against the jihadists under a different banner have now fled to an area under greater Turkish influence nearby.

Centuries-old statues and sculptures were wrecked by the jihadists when they twice seized control of the old city in central Syria during the country's war, which will go into its ninth year in March. 
The 1,800-year-old bust of a bejeweled and richly clothed woman, The Beauty of Palmyra, was damaged during the first offensive on the city by Islamic State fighters in 2015. 
After Syrian government forces took back the city with Russian military support in March 2016, the bust, alongside other damaged ancient monuments, was taken to Damascus and archived in boxes. When restoration work on it began last year, Youssef said it was in pieces.
""The hands and face were lost completely, also parts of the dress and there are areas that are weaker,"" Youssef, who has been working on the bust for two months, said.
Youssef is one of 12 archaeologists working on the arduous restoration job, which first began with the of moving the damaged pieces to Damascus. 
Mamoun Abdulkarim, the former Head of Syrian Antiquities, said that in some cases broken artifacts were transported in empty ammunition boxes provided by the Syrian army in Palmyra.
How many artifacts there are in total is difficult to say, given the state they were found in.
The lack of documentation for the artifacts also adds to the restoration challenge.
""A big part of the documentation in the Palmyra museum, was damaged with the antiquities and computers,"" archaeologist Raed Abbas said.

German authorities believe the 100 kg (220 pound) Canadian ""Big Maple Leaf"" - once recognized as the biggest gold coin in the world - has been melted down since its theft from Berlin's Bode Museum in March 2017.
Prosecutors say three of the suspects broke into the museum through an upstairs window and used a ladder, wheelbarrow and rope to extract the coin from a bullet-proof glass. The fourth suspect was a museum guard accused of helping them.
The coin, more than half a meter (yard) in diameter, three cm (1.2 inches) thick and made from ultra-pure gold, is one of just six produced by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 and was loaned to the museum by a private owner. It has a face value of $1 million but is thought to be worth four times as much.
It was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest gold coin in the world at the time it was made, although Australia has since minted one even bigger. Like other Canadian coins it bears the image of Canada's head of state, Britain's Queen Elizabeth.
The suspects were not identified under German legal rules. Three of them are related and three were under the age of 21 at the time of the crime, which means the trial took place in a youth court.
The men hid their faces behind magazines as they entered the court and during the proceedings. All are charged with serious theft, said the court. German media say the men could face up to three years and 10 months jail.
The Bode Museum has one of the world's largest coin collections with more than 540,000 items.

Duterte, who launched his campaign against drugs when he took office in mid-2016, remains hugely popular but doubts about the campaign, in which thousands of people have been killed, have been growing.
""Only I can say bishops are sons of bitches, damn you. That is true,"" Duterte said in a speech during a groundbreaking ceremony for a school north of the capital, Manila.
Duterte did not mention any particular reason for his criticism of the church on Thursday, which included a suggestion that most bishops are homosexual.
""Most of them are gay,"" he said. ""They should come out in the open, cancel celibacy and allow them to have boyfriends.""
Duterte, who is not a regular church-goer, said early in his presidency that he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a boy.
The Roman Catholic Church is facing clerical sexual abuse scandals in various parts of the world, although there have been no major cases in the Philippines.
In previous speeches, Duterte called God ""stupid"" and described as ""silly"" the doctrine of Holy Trinity.
Francis Lucas, an official with the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, played down the president's criticism saying all should show restraint. 
""We have to be more sensitive to the sensitivities and sensibilities of others out of respect,"" Lucas told Reuters.
The president's crackdown on drugs retains much support but some sectors of the church have become increasingly vocal about the killings, with calls for justice and offers of sanctuary to drug users.
Some 5,000 people have been killed in police anti-drugs operations in Duterte's anti-drug drive.
Police reject accusations that the killings were executions, saying drug peddlers and users were killed in shootouts, and police acted in self-defense.

About 80 percent of the more than 100 million people of the Philippines are Roman Catholic.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has come under fire for ""misogynistic"" remarks when he asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""be a man"" and not field a woman, the defense minister, to defend him in debates over a controversial fighter jet deal.
Gandhi, president of the Congress party, on Wednesday mocked Modi for staying away from parliament as it discussed accusations of corruption against the government in a deal to buy 36 Rafale planes from France's Dassault Aviation and a decision to pick Reliance Defence as a domestic partner.
The government and the companies deny the charges, but the latest controversy has intensified rivalry between Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of a general election due to be held by May.
Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled India for decades, often calls Modi a ""thief"" while the prime minister addresses him as ""privileged dynast"" in most of his public speeches.
""He runs away from the people's court and asks a woman, Nirmala Sitharaman ji, 'defend me, I won't be able to defend myself'"", Gandhi said at a public rally, referring to Modi and using a honorific for Sitharaman.
Gandhi's comments drew widespread criticism on social media. Some people said Sitharaman - the second woman to run the defense ministry after the late Indira Gandhi, a former prime minister and Rahul Gandhi's grandmother - deserved an apology.
Sitharaman has not commented but her cabinet colleague, Sushma Swaraj, also a woman, said Gandhi's comments hit a ""new low in the history of Indian politics"".
#BeAMan was one of the most trending hashtags on Twitter and some women posted their pictures holding placards that said: Mr. Rahul Gandhi, real men don't insult women"".
Congress rejected the accusations of misogyny, saying Gandhi was a ""progressive, inclusive and liberal leader"" and that the party believed in gender equality. It added the reference to ""woman"" by Gandhi was an ""innocent figure of speech"".
But the National Commission for Women, a statutory body that fights for women's rights, condemned Gandhi's comments.
""The remarks made are extremely misogynistic, offensive, unethical and show an extreme disrespect towards the dignity and honour of women in general,"" the commission said in a notice.
""The commission strongly condemns such irresponsible and disparaging views of persons holding responsible positions.""
The controversy came a day after Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya apologized for comments made during a high-profile talk show aired on Sunday, when he bragged about ""hitting"" on women and telling his parents about them.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",Greenland's residents grapple with global warming,"By Maria Caspani
(Reuters) - Nestled between icy peaks and lapped in frozen ocean waters, the tiny town of Tasiilaq in southeastern Greenland is home to some 2,000 people. 
Colorful wooden houses dot the sub-Arctic landscape battered by one of the harshest climates on the planet.
But global warming is reshaping the world's largest island, causing the ice sheet to melt at a faster rate than previously thought, according to recent research. 
As scientists study the threats posed by a warming climate, some of the immediate effects of climate change have been a double-edged sword for some in and around Tasiilaq.
Julius Nielsen, 40, who lives about 45 km (28 miles) from Tasiilaq, has been hunting and fishing in the area most of his life.
""There's no snow, it's too hot and the water is not freezing,"" said Nielsen. A thin, frail ice sheet - or lack of ice - pose a big problem for locals like Nielsen who are not able to go hunting with their sled dogs, or have to take alternate routes. 
Continued global warming will accelerate thawing of the ice sheet and contribute to rising sea levels worldwide, scientists have found. 
A United Nations report released in October urged nations to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels in order to minimize global sea level rise, reduce flooding and the overall impact of climate change on the world's ecosystems. This would require global net carbon dioxide emissions to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels.
Nielsen said that, over the last 10 years, it has become increasingly hard to reach usual hunting grounds with sled dogs due to unpredictable weather, thinning ice or no ice at all. 
""Every year we see the glaciers, the landscape, the ice sheet melting and melting,"" he said. ""What we know from our ancestors is almost gone and we cannot take it back. We have to find new tools.""
Lars Anker Moeller used to be able to take tourists out on his signature five-day sled dog ride every year when he started working at tour operator Arctic-Dream over a decade ago. 
Now, Moeller often has to take his clients on alternate routes because of the lack of ice.
But there is a silver lining. 
Ice retreating earlier in the year is freeing access to areas that were previously locked away for longer, and it has allowed Moeller to kick off boat tours for tourists much earlier in the summer season, said the 45-year-old Dane. 
""Instead of having three months, we can go (on boats) four months or five months,"" Moeller. 
In addition, fish such as mackerel, usually not found in the icy seawater of Greenland, are now abundant - a boon for the local fishing industry, Moeller and Nielsen said.
Moeller also cited another temporary advantage climate change has brought to his tourism business: People want to see the ice cap before it is too late. 
""Go and see the glaciers before they disappear. That's the thing you hear again and again,"" Moeller said.
A first-of-its-kind survey conducted in December by the University of Copenhagen, the University of Greenland and Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research sought to paint a picture of how Greenlandic residents view climate change. 
The study found that over four in 10 residents believe climate change will harm them, while just one in 10 think they will benefit from it.
""Our results indicate that climate change is personally relevant to most people living here and something which the majority of residents are already experiencing now,"" Kelton Minor, one of the survey's authors, told Reuters in a phone interview from Nuuk.
For many in Greenland, it is a daily reality.
""About eight in 10 residents say that they have directly experienced climate change, over 60 percent think that it's extremely important or very important to them personally... and slightly less than half the population think that climate change will harm them,"" Minor said. 
Despite the new challenges brought by the changing climate, Greenland's residents are known for their resilience. 
""The beauty is that Greenlanders have always been good at adapting, so they will survive anyway, whatever will happen,"" Moeller said.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",Malta accuses Italy's Salvini of 'unfounded claims' on migrants,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta on Thursday accused Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini of willful inaccuracy in accusing the small island state of breaking promises to take in Mediterranean migrants.
Salvini, leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant League party, on Wednesday said Malta had failed to take in 50 migrants who disembarked in July in Sicily.
Malta replied that Salvini had failed to say that Italy had agreed to take in 50 from Malta from a separate disembarkation, and the two countries had agreed to call it even and keep the respective contingents.
In a statement, it invited the Italian government to ""revise its statistics and refrain from repeating unfounded claims"".
Salvini shot back on Twitter that he would accept ""no lessons from Malta, which for years closed its eyes and let big and little boats sail toward Italy"".
Since Salvini took power in an alliance with the populist 5-Star Movement in June last year, he has closed Italy's ports to humanitarian rescue ships that it had previously welcomed.
That has led to a number of diplomatic spats with Malta - the European Union's smallest country and closest to the Libyan coast from which many migrant boats set off - over whose responsibility it is to let the ships dock.
Although boat migrant arrivals fell 80 percent last year, the EU executive Commission in Brussels has still been forced to mediate between member states to share out arrivals.
On Thursday, 51 migrants reached southern Italy in a sailing boat.

In Rome overnight, Salvini agreed with his coalition partners and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to let in a dozen migrants who he had promised to keep out.

The government of the world's second biggest garment exporter behind China said this week it would consider demands for an increase in the minimum wage, after clashes between police and protesters killed one worker and wounded dozens.
Around 30 people were wounded on Thursday as police fired tear gas to disperse stone-throwing protesters in the Ashulia industrial belt, on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, that accounts for nearly 20 percent of total garment exports.
Nearly 50 factories closed after hundreds of workers took to the streets demanding higher wages, police official Rezaul Haque said.
""We had no other option but to use tear gas as they blocked a major highway,"" Haque added.
The protests pose a problem for the government of Sheikh Hasina, who won a third straight term in Dec. 30 elections which themselves were marred by violence amid allegations of widespread rigging and voter intimidation.
The government said in September that the minimum wage for garment workers would increase by up to 51 percent this year to 8,000 taka ($95) a month, the first such increase since 2013.
But union leaders say that increase will benefit only a small percentage of workers in the garment sector, which employs 4 million in the country of 165 million people.

Low wages and trade deals with Western countries have made the sector a $30 billion industry accounting for 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>","Taiwan premier, cabinet to quit after local election defeat","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Premier William Lai said on Thursday he was resigning along with the self-ruled island's entire cabinet, nearly two months after the defeat of his ruling pro-independence party in local elections.
The election losses present a major challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen who has come under mounting domestic criticism over her reform agenda while facing renewed threats from China, which considers the island its own.
Lai's departure was widely expected. It is standard practice in Taiwan for leaders to go when their party loses a major election. The DPP suffered a significant defeat in November to the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang. 
It is also customary for the cabinet to step down when the premier resigns. 
""The time is up. I will call a special cabinet meeting tomorrow and resign along with the entire cabinet,"" Lai told reporters in parliament, adding that Tsai had approved his resignation. 
Tsai, who is also from the DPP, was expected to announce a new premier, Lai said, and ministerial appointments would follow.
Taiwan's elected president appoints the premier, who forms the cabinet and runs the government on a day-to-day basis. 
Analysts said Tsai, who faces a presidential election in about a year, must shore up public support for her policy on relations with Beijing and boost the island's export-reliant economy in a challenging year amid the China-U.S. trade dispute.
Chinese President Xi Jinping this month threatened to use force to bring democratic Taiwan under Beijing's rule and urged ""reunification"" with the island. 
Xi has stepped up pressure on Taiwan since Tsai became president in 2016.
Tsai has said her administration would reflect upon on the election defeat but would stand firm to defend Taiwan's democracy in the face of renewed Chinese threats.
Some from within the embattled leader's party have urged Tsai not to seek re-election. She has not explicitly said whether she would run for president in 2020. 

The latest tension with China is credit negative for Taiwan and would hurt the island's economy, Moody's said in a report this week.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is making a push toward a treaty with Russia over the islands and is due to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month, but Moscow has shown no willingness to concede control over the islands. 
Russia and Japan have been in dispute for seven decades over island territories captured by Soviet troops in the last days of World War Two. They are known in Russia as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles and in Japan as the Northern Territories.
Russia's foreign ministry said late on Wednesday it had summoned Japan's ambassador in Moscow to complain about comments made by Tokyo that it said ""crudely distort the essence of agreements between Russia and Japan's leaders on accelerating the negotiation process...""
""Such statements cannot be regarded except as an attempt to artificially aggravate the atmosphere around the problem of the peace treaty, to impose one's own scenario for its resolution on the other side,"" it said.
The ministry drew attention late on Wednesday to comments made by Japan about the need to reach an understanding with Russians living on the islands about their transfer to Japanese control. 
The ministry also protested comments it said that Tokyo had made about Moscow refusing to pay compensation to Japan for ""occupying"" the islands. 
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Thursday that Tokyo had already conveyed its stance to Moscow, but declined to comment on details. 
""We continue to work persistently based on our basic policy that we aim to resolve the issue of the islands and have a peace treaty,"" Suga said.

Russia hopes the MS-21, a twin-engine, medium-range passenger plane, will give Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus a run for their money. Three prototypes have been built and the plane had been set to enter serial production in 2020. 
But Kommersant, citing a senior government official and Russian aviation industry sources, said U.S. sanctions had cut off imports of components from the United States and Japan that were needed to make the plane's wings and part of its tail fin.
The two manufacturers whose products had been affected were Connecticut-based Hexcel of the United States and Japan's Toray Industries, the newspaper said.
Russia did not make the necessary components and could not start doing so quickly, Kommersant reported. Previous component deliveries meant Russia only had enough material on hand to make the wings of six more aircraft, it said.
The MS-21's wings, which were to be made from composite materials rather than metal, had been designed to give the aircraft the edge in some respects over Western rivals, Kommersant said.
Russia's United Aircraft Corporation confirmed on Thursday that U.S. sanctions had caused it problems. The company said it had taken measures to maintain wing production and had embarked upon ""the step-by-step replacement of the necessary components"" with Russian-made equivalents.
Russia's Aeroflot has agreed to lease 50 of the new planes and Moscow has said Syria is in talks about buying the new aircraft.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Thursday there was no timeframe for the assessment of the case of Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, a Saudi woman who fled to Thailand saying she feared her family would kill her.
The U.N. refugee agency has referred Qunun to Australia for consideration for refugee resettlement.
""Following the UNHCR referrals, Australia is now going through the steps we are required to do in relation to the assessment process and then when that is complete an announcement will be made,"" Payne said in Bangkok, after arriving on a visit arranged before Qunun sought asylum.
Qunun is staying in a Bangkok hotel under the care of the UNHCR.
She arrived in Thailand on Saturday and was initially denied entry. She had been intending to fly from there to Australia to seek asylum.
She soon started posting messages on Twitter from the transit area of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport saying she had ""escaped Kuwait"" and her life would be in danger if forced to return to Saudi Arabia.
Within hours, a campaign sprang up, spread by a loose network of online activists, and the world watched as she refused to board a flight to Saudi Arabia and barricade herself inside a transit lounge hotel room.
On Monday evening, Thai authorities allowed her to enter the country.
Her case has drawn attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.
'AUSTRALIA'S CONCERN'
Payne's visit has also thrown a spotlight on another refugee case, involving Bahrain footballer Hakeem AlAraibi, who has refugee status in Australia but was arrested at Bangkok airport last year after arriving for his honeymoon.
Bahrain made a request to have him extradited and he is in jail, waiting for a hearing to decide his case.
Payne with held talks with Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong, who is also justice minister, and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.
""I also appreciate the opportunity ... to raise Australia's concern about the detention of and possible return of Mr Hakeem AlAraibi to Bahrain,"" Payne told reporters after the meeting. 
""The Thai government is aware of the importance of this matter to Australia.""
AlAraibi was convicted for vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia.
""He has denied all wrongdoing as accused by the Bahrain government,"" Nadthasiri Bergman, AlAraibi's lawyer in Thailand told Reuters.
""He would be put in danger if he is sent back to Bahrain.""
World football governing body FIFA says AlAraibi should be freed and allowed to return to Australia where he plays for Melbourne football club Pascoe Vale in the second tier of the Australian League.
Activists have called on Thai authorities to ""show humanity"" to AlAraibi in the same way that they did to Qunun.

Henan, a major coal and metal producer in central China, is under heavy pressure to curb pollution and restructure its industrial economy as Beijing's five-year ""war on pollution"" expands to more regions. 
It promised late last year that it would work to slash coal consumption by 15 percent by 2020, but many of its mining-dependent cities are struggling to find alternative sources of growth.
Over the course of 2018, concentrations of lung-damaging small particle pollution known as PM2.5 fell 1.6 percent from a year earlier to 61 micrograms per cubic meter. That beat its target of 63 micrograms, but is still well above China's national standard of 35 micrograms.
""The province's air quality has continuously improved,"" said Jiao Fei, the vice-head of the provincial environmental protection office, according to a transcript of a press conference posted by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment on Thursday 
Still, A Reuters analysis of official pollution data showed that PM2.5 in nine industrial cities in Henan rose by an average of 12 percent in December, hitting 82 micrograms. It hit nearly 100 micrograms in November, more than double a year earlier.
Jiao blamed poor weather over the last two months of the year, saying that ""diffusion conditions"" in Henan were significantly worse than normal, leading to longer smog outbreaks. 
""Heavy pollution weather conditions in Henan were much more severe than in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and other provinces,"" he said.

According to MEE data published this week, PM2.5 levels in 338 cities across China fell 9.3 percent compared to last year to an average of 39 micrograms. A total of 262 cities failed to meet the national standard of 35 micrograms over the year.

Days after the arrest, China detained two Canadian citizens - businessman Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group - whom it is investigating for endangering its national security.
In an article in the Ottawa-based Hill Times newspaper on Wednesday, Ambassador Lu Shaye said Canada's demands for the release of the two men reflected ""double standards"" born of ""Western egotism and white supremacy"".
Lu wrote, ""It seems that, to those people, the laws of Canada or other Western countries are laws and must be observed, while China's laws are not, and shouldn't be respected.""
A lack of concern in Canada for Meng suggested that humanitarian treatment was only deemed necessary for Canadian citizens, not Chinese people, he added. 
China has not drawn a direct link between its detention of the two Canadians and Meng's arrest, but Beijing-based Western diplomats have called the cases a tit-for-tat reprisal.
While Meng has had full access to lawyers, has been granted bail and is able to see family, Kovrig is being denied legal representation, is not allowed to see family, and is limited to one consular visit a month.
The United States has sought to extradite Meng on charges of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. 
Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment and the second-biggest smartphone seller.

Since at least 2016, the United States has been looking into whether Huawei shipped U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, Reuters reported in April.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2019 01:47AM ET</span>",South Korea's Moon calls for 'bold steps' ahead of second Kim-Trump summit,"By Hyonhee Shin and John Ruwitch
SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday North Korea should take bold steps towards denuclearisation, such as abandoning long-range missiles, to extract U.S. concessions amid a prolonged stalemate in their nuclear negotiations.
Moon Jae-in also said the North would have to seek a compromise in a second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said could be imminent, in order to resolve the impasse. 
Pyongyang and Washington have been struggling to find a breakthrough despite a pledge by Kim at his landmark summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June to work towards denuclearisation.
Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear and missile tests, and declare an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War.
Those demands were in response to Pyongyang's initial, unilateral steps toward denuclearisation that included dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility.
Moon said North Korea should take more concrete steps, such as abandoning its intercontinental and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and dismantling weapons production lines and other nuclear complexes, to secure U.S. concessions such as sanctions relief. 
He said reducing U.S. military commitments, such as a withdrawal of troops or strategic assets from the region, would be an unlikely option for Washington.
""The second summit would be a venue where they settle on terms of what specific measures North Korea will take and how those moves will be reciprocated by the United States,"" Moon told a news conference at the presidential Blue House in Seoul.
""But U.S. forces in South Korea or strategic assets in places like Guam and Japan are not linked with North Korea alone, as they exist for the stability and peace of the entire Northeast Asia,"" he said.
SECOND SUMMIT SOON?
Kim renewed his resolve to meet Trump again during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week. Moon said Kim's latest trip to Beijing signalled that a second Trump summit was imminent.
Another U.S.-North Korea summit would also expedite an unprecedented visit by Kim to Seoul, planned for last year but delayed amid the nuclear standoff, Moon said.
""I expect we'll hear about high-level talks between North Korea and the United States before long for their second summit,"" Moon said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trips to Pyongyang last year. However, a meeting between Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol has yet to be rescheduled after an abrupt cancellation in November.
North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday Kim and Xi held ""in-depth, frank discussions"" on the Korean peninsula and nuclear issues during Kim's stay in Beijing, his fourth since March 2018.
Kim told Xi about the difficulties and concerns in improving North Korea-U.S. relations and denuclearisation negotiations, KCNA said. Xi agreed that North Korea's reasonable concerns must be addressed properly, it said.
China's official Xinhua news agency also said Pyongyang's ""legitimate concerns"" must be taken seriously in order to achieve a comprehensive resolution on the Korean peninsula.
Xinhua quoted Xi as saying he hoped that North Korea and the United States could meet each other half way and that the international community expected peaceful negotiations. 
""The political settlement of the peninsula issue faces a rare historic opportunity,"" Xi said.
Kim reiterated a pledge from his New Year's speech that the North would try to make a second summit achieve a result that the international community would welcome, Xinhua said.
Wang Yiwei, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, said he believed North Korea was becoming impatient and beginning to lose hope with the United States for asking it to make changes without in turn removing sanctions.

""The crux is how to let North Korea denuclearise and to give it security guarantees. On this, the United States and North Korea don't have trust, so China has to act as a bridge,"" Wang said.

Sudan's second-largest city ""witnessed riots and illegal gatherings"" on Wednesday, SUNA said, amid weeks of demonstrations.
SUNA quoted police as saying that they knew of three deaths and several people being wounded and that these attacks were being investigated.
No other details were immediately available.
Police chased demonstrators into side roads, from where they regrouped to resume their protests, witnesses said. Hundreds also blocked a main road.
Bashir vowed at a rally of thousands of supporters in the capital Khartoum on Wednesday that he would stay in power.
His speech failed to quell the unrest, with security forces fighting running battles on Wednesday with protesters in Omdurman on the other side of the Nile to the capital.

Protesters have been staging demonstrations almost daily for weeks, enraged by shortages of bread and foreign currency. The unrest has come as the ruling party has pressed ahead with plans to change the constitution so Bashir can stay in office beyond his present term, which ends in 2020.

More than a dozen foreign offices received suspicious packages on Wednesday, including the U.S. and British missions in Melbourne.
The man, named as Savas Avan, was charged with sending dangerous articles through a postal service, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a statement.
Police said the packages contained asbestos, once a popular building material that can cause cancer and scaring of the lungs.
Police, who have recovered 29 of the parcels, said they would intercept the rest. They gave no additional details of how the asbestos was packaged or what the motive might have been. 
Australian media on Wednesday said the parcels appeared to contain plastic bags of concrete and asbestos, with ""asbestos"" written on at least one of the bags.
The Age newspaper said one firefighter was seen outside the South Korean consulate carrying a large plastic bag with the word ""asbestos"" written on it.
Other missions in Melbourne reported by media to have received suspicious packages included those of Denmark, Egypt, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Reuters could not confirm the reports.
Avan, who was originally said by police to be 48 years old, will next appear in court in March.
There was no ongoing threat to the general public, the AFP said. 
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said it had sent an email to all diplomatic missions in Canberra this week, after three offices in the capital and Sydney received suspicious packages. 
It subsequently sent similar advice to missions elsewhere. 

""The note advised missions to handle mail in accordance with their own government's protocols and instructions,"" a DFAT spokesman said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday Japan's political leaders should not undermine bilateral ties by ""politicizing"" the issue of South Koreans forced to work by Japanese companies during World War Two. 
Relations between the two East Asian neighbors have been frosty since South Korea's top court ruled in October that Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp should compensate four former laborers.
Japan subsequently claimed that a South Korean warship had locked its radar on a Japanese patrol plane.
On Wednesday, Tokyo demanded diplomatic consultations with Seoul after a South Korean court approved the seizure of part of the domestic assets of the Japanese steelmaker, calling the move ""extremely regrettable"". 
Moon called for the Japanese government to foster a ""more humble attitude"" towards wartime issues and to respect judicial decisions, in which he said his administration could not exert any influence.
""We've been saying we should continue diplomatic discussions on the issue and should not hurt our forward-looking relationship with Japan,"" Moon told a news conference. 
""I don't think it is wise for Japanese politicians and leader to continue to politicize it, making sources of controversy and spreading them,"" he said. 
South Korea and Japan share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula, the forced mobilization of labor at Japanese companies and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.

Those issues have not been resolved by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations, Moon said, and the two countries should try to find ways to heal the wounds of victims.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 11:19PM ET</span>",Philippine court orders jail for former bank manager over Bangladesh central bank heist,"By Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine court on Thursday held a former bank manager guilty on eight counts of money laundering, the first conviction in one of the world's largest cyber heists, in which $81 million was stolen from Bangladesh's central bank nearly three years ago.
The regional court sentenced Maia Deguito, a former branch manager at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC), to a jail term ranging from 32 to 56 years, with each count carrying four to seven years.
She was also ordered to pay a total fine of about $109 million. 
In February 2016, unknown criminals used fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system to steal the funds from the Bangladesh's central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
The money was sent to accounts at a branch of RCBC in Manila then headed by Deguito, before it disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.
""Her declaration in open court that she has nothing to do with these transactions was a complete and comprehensive lie,"" the court said in its 26-page ruling. 
Deguito facilitated and coordinated and corroborated in the execution and implementation of the illegal bank transactions, the court added. 
""The conviction of Deguito is consistent with the bank's position that it is the victim in this situation and that Deguito is a rogue employee,"" RCBC spokeswoman Thea Daep said in a statement.
Deguito remains free, however, as bail she posted earlier stays in effect until the conviction becomes final, one of her lawyers, Joaquin Hizon, told Reuters. 
Her other lawyer, Demetrio Custodio, told Reuters she intended to appeal Thursday's ruling and carry the case to the Supreme Court, if necessary, to win acquittal.
In a separate interview with news channel ANC, Custodio said, ""There should be more people who should be more liable for this, other than a very lowly bank officer who has nothing to do with operational matters."" 
RCBC was fined a record 1 billion pesos ($19.17 million) by the Philippine central bank in August 2016 for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through the bank.
A former treasurer of RCBC and five other workers at the branch where the cash was withdrawn face money laundering charges. 
""We hope that this case could be expedited and could go to trial soon for a decision,"" Asad Alam Siam, Bangladesh's ambassador to the Philippines, told Reuters, regarding the charges. 
Just $15 million of the stolen money has been recovered from a Manila junket operator, a role that involves marketing casinos to VIPs.
Bangladesh bank, finance and law ministry officials are visiting New York this week for talks to try and move forward the recovery process. They will have to make a decision on suing the parties involved.

Doan Anh Sang, former deputy chief executive officer of the bank, formally known as Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, was accused of ""violations of regulations on banking operations"", Tien Phong newspaper reported, citing police.
The bank's former chairman, Tran Bac Ha was arrested in November, and according to the newspaper four other BDVI officials have also been arrested.
BIDV, one Vietnam's largest listed banks, did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Sang's lawyer was not immediately available for comment either. 
Sang was removed from his position at the bank in August amid a larger investigation into wrongdoings at the bank, the report said.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's electoral commission on Thursday declared opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi the winner of a disorganized and contentious Dec. 30 presidential election. 
The result could lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960, with longtime President Joseph Kabila due to step down in coming days. 
But vote tallies compiled by Congo's Catholic Church found that another opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, clearly won the election, two diplomats said, raising the specter of a standoff that many fear could lead to violence.
Election commission (CENI) president Corneille Nangaa, speaking around 3 a.m. (0200 GMT) at a news conference that appeared timed to avoid any immediate reaction in the streets, said Tshisekedi had won with 38.57 percent of the more than 18 million ballots cast. 
""Felix Tshisekedi Tshilombo is declared the provisionally-elected president of Democratic Republic of Congo,"" Nangaa said to a mixture of cheers and gasps inside CENI headquarters. 
Nangaa said Tshisekedi had received more than 7 million votes, compared to about 6.4 million for Fayulu and about 4.4 million for Kabila's hand-picked candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. 
The result is certain to fuel further suspicion that Tshisekedi, who the last opinion polls before the election showed running well behind Fayulu, struck a power-sharing pact with Kabila. 
Tshisekedi's camp has acknowledged contacts since the vote with Kabila's representatives but denies there has been any kind of deal. 
Losing candidates, including Fayulu and Shadary, can contest the results before Congo's constitutional court, which has 10 days to hear and rule on any challenges.
The Church's bishops conference said last week that it knew the identity of the winner and demanded that CENI publish accurate results. The Church did not say who it thought the winner was, but briefed diplomats on its conclusions.
More than one million people were kept from voting on election day on Dec. 30 because of an Ebola outbreak and militia violence in opposition strongholds mainly in the east of the country.
Observers said many polling stations opened late and closed early and in some places voting machines malfunctioned. 

Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, had wanted to hand over power to Shadary, his former interior minister, when he stands down this month after 18 years in power.
